abstractNote = {Pulse shapes, arrival times, and interstellar scintillations of the 1.56 ms PSR 1937 + 214 pulsar are analyzed at frequencies from 0.32 to 1.4 GHz using data obtained from April 1983 to December 1985. The narrow pulse and small period of the pulsar yield arrival times that are much more precise than those of most other pulsars. Arrival time precision for the pulsar is limited at low frequencies by distortions of the pulse shape imposed by interstellar scintillations. Arrival times at all radio frequencies are affected by variations in dispersion measure and, possibly, additional variations related to variations in angle of arrival. Uncertainties in how the pulse shape varies with frequency influence estimates of dispersion measures. The interstellar scintillation and pulse broadening of the pulsar strongly constrain the spatial power spectrum of electron density variations in the ISM. 70 refs.},

    abstract = "{We have measured the scintillation properties of 151 young, energetic pulsars with the Parkes radio telescope and have identified two extreme scattering events (ESEs). Towards PSR J1057−5226, we discovered a 3 yr span of strengthened scattering during which the variability in flux density and the scintillation bandwidth decreased markedly. The transverse size of the scattering region is ∼23 au, and strong flux density enhancement before and after the ESE may arise from refractive focusing. Long observations reveal scintillation arcs characteristic of interference between rays scattered at large angles, and the clearest arcs appear during the ESE. The arcs suggest scattering by a screen 100–200 pc from the Earth, perhaps ionized filamentary structure associated with the boundary of the local bubble(s). Towards PSR J1740−3015, we observed a ‘double dip’ in the measured flux density similar to ESEs observed towards compact extragalactic radio sources. The observed shape is consistent with that produced by a many-au scale diverging plasma lens with electron density ∼500 cm−3. The continuing ESE is at least 1500 d long, making it the longest detected event to date. These detections, with materially different observational signatures, indicate that well-calibrated pulsar monitoring is a keen tool for ESE detection and interstellar medium (ISM) diagnostics. They illustrate the strong role au-scale non-Kolmogorov density fluctuations and the local ISM structure play in such events and are key to understanding both their intrinsic physics and their impact on other phenomena, particularly fast radio bursts.}",

Demorest et al. was the first to show a short-term (∼100–200 days) reduction in the electron content along the line of sight to PSR J1713+0747 in data from 2008 (approximately MJD 54750) based on an apparent dip in the dispersion measure of the pulsar. We report on a similar event in 2016 (approximately MJD 57510), with average residual pulse-arrival times ≈−3.0, −1.3, and −0.7 μs at 820, 1400, and 2300 MHz, respectively. Timing analyses indicate possible departures from the standard ν−2 dispersive-delay dependence. We discuss and rule out a wide variety of potential interpretations. We find the likeliest scenario to be lensing of the radio emission by some structure in the interstellar medium, which causes multiple frequency-dependent pulse arrival-time delays.}

After enough time has elapsed, pulsar timing arrays enter a new regime where the signal to noise only scales as . In addition, in this regime the quality of the pulsar timing data and the cadence become relatively unimportant. This occurs because the lowest frequencies of the pulsar timing residuals become gravitational-wave dominated. Pulsar timing arrays enter this regime more quickly than one might naively suspect. For T = 10 yr observations and typical stochastic background amplitudes, pulsars with residual root-mean-squares of less than about 1 μs are already in that regime. The best strategy to increase the detectability of the background in this regime is to increase the number of pulsars in the array. We also perform realistic simulations of the NANOGrav pulsar timing array, which through an aggressive pulsar survey campaign adds new millisecond pulsars regularly to its array, and show that a detection is possible within a decade, and could occur as early as 2016.}

We use this approach to simultaneously estimate temporal variations in both the dispersion measure (DM) and scattering, together with a model for the pulse profile that includes smooth evolution as a function of frequency, and the pulsar's timing model. We show that fixing the scattering time-scales when forming time-of-arrival estimates, as has been suggested in the context of traditional pulsar timing analysis, can significantly underestimate the uncertainties in both DM and the arrival time of the pulse, leading to bias in the timing parameters. We apply our method using a new, publicly available, GPU-accelerated code, both to simulations and observations of the millisecond pulsar PSR J1643−1224. This pulsar is known to exhibit significant scattering variability compared to typical millisecond pulsars, and we find including low-frequency (\\&lt;1 GHz) data without a model for these scattering variations leads to significant periodic structure in the DM, and also biases the astrometric parameters at the 4σ level, for example, changing proper motion in right ascension by 0.50 ± 0.12. If low-frequency observations are to be included when significant scattering variations are present, we conclude it is necessary to not just model those variations, but also to sample the parameters that describe the variations simultaneously with all other parameters in the model, a task for which profile domain pulsar timing is ideally suited.}",

	abstract = {We report here on variable propagation effects in over 20 yr of multifrequency timing analysis of pulsar PSR B1937+21 that determine small-scale properties of the intervening plasma as it drifts through the sight line. The phase structure function derived from the dispersion measure variations is in remarkable agreement with that expected from the Kolmogorov spectrum, with a power-law index of 3.66 ± 0.04, valid over an inferred scale range of 0.2-50 AU. The observed flux variation timescale and the modulation index, along with their frequency dependence, are discrepant with the values expected from a Kolmogorov spectrum with infinitesimally small inner scale cutoff, suggesting a caustic-dominated regime of interstellar optics. This implies an inner scale cutoff to the spectrum of ~1.3 × 109 m. Our timing solutions indicate a transverse velocity of 9 km s-1 with respect to the solar system barycenter, and 80 km s-1 with respect to the pulsar's LSR. We interpret the frequency-dependent variations of DM as a result of the apparent angular broadening of the source, which is a sensitive function of frequency (∝ ν-2.2). The error introduced by this in timing this pulsar is ~2.2 μs at 1 GHz. The timing error introduced by "image wandering" from the slow, nominally refractive scintillation effects is about 125 ns at 1 GHz. The error accumulated due to positional error (due to image wandering) in solar system barycentric corrections is about 85 ns at 1 GHz.}

	abstract = {The radio millisecond pulsar J1713+0747 is regarded as one of the highest-precision clocks in the sky and is regularly timed for the purpose of detecting gravitational waves. The International Pulsar Timing Array Collaboration undertook a 24 hr global observation of PSR J1713+0747 in an effort to better quantify sources of timing noise in this pulsar, particularly on intermediate (1–24 hr) timescales. We observed the pulsar continuously over 24 hr with the Arecibo, Effelsberg, GMRT, Green Bank, LOFAR, Lovell, Nançay, Parkes, and WSRT radio telescopes. The combined pulse times-of-arrival presented here provide an estimate of what sources of timing noise, excluding DM variations, would be present as compared to an idealized improvement in timing precision, where N is the number of pulses analyzed. In the case of this particular pulsar, we find that intrinsic pulse phase jitter dominates arrival time precision when the signal-to-noise ratio of single pulses exceeds unity, as measured using the eight telescopes that observed at L band/1.4 GHz. We present first results of specific phenomena probed on the unusually long timescale (for a single continuous observing session) of tens of hours, in particular interstellar scintillation, and discuss the degree to which scintillation and profile evolution affect precision timing. This paper presents the data set as a basis for future, deeper studies.}

	title = {Frequency-dependent Template Profiles for High-precision Pulsar Timing},
	journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
	abstract = {Pulsar timing experiments require high-fidelity template profiles in order to minimize the biases in pulse time-of-arrival (TOA) measurements and their uncertainties. Efforts to acquire more precise TOAs given the fixed effective area of telescopes, finite receiver noise, and limited integration time have led pulsar astronomers to the solution of implementing ultra-wideband receivers. This solution, however, has run up against the problem that pulse profile shapes evolve with frequency, which raises the question of how to properly measure and analyze TOAs obtained using template-matching methods. This paper proposes a new method for one facet of this problem, that of template profile generation, and demonstrates it on the well-timed millisecond pulsar J1713+0747. Specifically, we decompose pulse profile evolution into a linear combination of basis eigenvectors, the coefficients of which change slowly with frequency such that their evolution is modeled simply by a sum of low-degree piecewise polynomial spline functions. These noise-free, high-fidelity, frequency-dependent templates can be used to make measurements of so-called “wideband TOAs” simultaneously with an estimate of the instantaneous dispersion measure. The use of wideband TOAs is becoming important for pulsar timing array experiments, as the volume of data sets comprised of conventional, subbanded TOAs are quickly becoming unwieldy for the Bayesian analyses needed to uncover latent gravitational wave signals. Although motivated by high-precision timing experiments, our technique is applicable in more general pulsar observations.}

	abstract = {The dispersion measure (DM), the column density of free electrons to a pulsar, is shown to be frequency dependent because of multipath scattering from small-scale electron-density fluctuations. DMs vary between propagation paths whose transverse extent varies strongly with frequency, yielding arrival times that deviate from the high-frequency scaling expected for a cold, uniform, unmagnetized plasma (1/frequency2). Scaling laws for thin phase screens are verified with simulations; extended media are also analyzed. The rms DM difference across an octave band near 1.5 GHz is ∼ 4 × 10−5 pc cm−3 for pulsars at ∼1 kpc distance. The corresponding arrival-time variations are a few to hundreds of nanoseconds for DM ≲ 30 pc cm−3 but increase rapidly to microseconds or more for larger DMs and wider frequency ranges. Chromatic DMs introduce correlated noise into timing residuals with a power spectrum of “low pass” form. The correlation time is roughly the geometric mean of the refraction times for the highest and lowest radio frequencies used, ranging from days to years, depending on the pulsar. We discuss implications for methodologies that use large frequency separations or wide bandwidth receivers for timing measurements. Chromatic DMs are partially mitigable by including an additional chromatic term in arrival time models. Without mitigation, an additional term in the noise model for pulsar timing is implied. In combination with measurement errors from radiometer noise, an arbitrarily large increase in total frequency range (or bandwidth) will yield diminishing benefits and may be detrimental to overall timing precision.}

	abstract = {We report on an effort to extract and monitor interstellar scintillation parameters in regular timing observations collected for the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves pulsar timing array. Scattering delays are measured by creating dynamic spectra for each pulsar and observing epoch of wide-band observations centered near 1500 MHz and carried out at the Green Bank Telescope and the Arecibo Observatory. The ∼800 MHz wide frequency bands imply dramatic changes in scintillation bandwidth across the bandpass, and a stretching routine has been included to account for this scaling. For most of the 10 pulsars for which the scaling has been measured, the bandwidths scale with frequency less steeply than expected for a Kolmogorov medium. We find estimated scattering delay values that vary with time by up to an order of magnitude. The mean measured scattering delays are similar to previously published values and are slightly higher than predicted by interstellar medium models. We investigate the possibility of increasing the timing precision by mitigating timing errors introduced by the scattering delays. For most of the pulsars, the uncertainty in the time of arrival of a single timing point is much larger than the maximum variation of the scattering delay, suggesting that diffractive scintillation remains as only a negligible part of their noise budget.}

abstract = {In addition to being fascinating objects to study in their own right, pulsars are exquisite tools for probing a variety of issues in basic physics. Recycled pulsars, thought to have been spun up in previous episodes of mass accretion from orbiting companion stars, are especially well suited for such applications. They are extraordinarily stable clocks, approaching and perhaps exceeding the long-term stabilities of the best terrestrial time standards. Most of them are found in binary systems, with orbital velocities as large as 10 -3 c. They provide unique opportunities for measuring neutron star masses, thereby yielding fundamental astrophysical data difficult to acquire by any other means. And they open the way for high precision tests of the nature of gravity under conditions much more ‘relativistic ' than found anywhere within the Solar System. Among other results, pulsar timing observations have convincingly established the existence of quadrupolar gravitational waves propagating at the speed of light. They have also placed interesting limits on possible departures of the strong-field nature of gravity from general relativity, on the rate of change of Newton's constant, G , and on the energy density of low-frequency gravitational waves in the universe.},
