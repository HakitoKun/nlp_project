"a typical rainfall time series has several properties that are difficult to capture in a simple statistical model , including a heavily skewed marginal distribution that is distinctly non - gaussian , a large proportion of zero values , and frequent large fluctuations .
thus there is a need for specialised models for rainfall which can capture the unique characteristics of this type of process .
the existing literature on modelling rainfall is large and spread over fields such as hydrology , atmospheric sciences , environmental risk analysis and statistics .
@xcite classifies the different approaches into four categories : meteorological models based on large sets of differential equations , multi - scale models concerned with the spatial evolution of rainfall , statistical models that capture spatial and temporal trends , and finally stochastic process models that make simple assumptions in order to remain parsimonious . in the following
we will focus on models of the last category .
many of the early attempts at modelling rainfall use a simple model that represents the rainfall occurrence process as a two - state markov chain , and models the intensity of rainfall with a gamma distribution  @xcite .
this model is easy to interpret and enables the direct use of likelihood methods for fitting .
however , it makes several restrictive assumptions on the rainfall process , and may require a high - order markov chain with many parameters to capture observed temporal dependence .
there is also a large literature on modelling rainfall for hydrological applications based on a form of the poisson - cluster model , first developed by @xcite and @xcite .
this model is based on a hierarchical structure , with a primary poisson process controlling the arrival of storms and a secondary process generating cells from each storm , which then deposit rainfall .
there have been numerous extensions of the poisson - cluster model that focus on fitting specific properties of the observed rainfall process .
for example , @xcite considers an extended model that allows for different rainfall cell types , where each cell has a random duration and intensity depending on its type , allowing for the different types of precipitation that are observed in practice .    in terms of fitting specific properties of rainfall that are of interest for hydrological applications , extensions to the poisson - cluster model
generally perform very well .
however , as remarked by @xcite , there is always a trade - off between the inclusion of more features and the mathematical tractability of the resulting models .
poisson - cluster based models are usually fitted by the method of moments , which involves matching analytical expressions for properties such as the mean , variance , and proportion of dry intervals to their empirical equivalents .
@xcite , remarks that the method of moments approach `` suffers from the disadvantage that the parameter estimates can vary greatly depending on the properties used in the fitting procedure '' , and proposes a spectral estimation method for estimating rainfall models based on point processes .
the contribution of the present paper is twofold .
first , we develop a parsimonious and analytically tractable model that captures the distributional features and autocorrelation structure of the observed rainfall time series .
we relate the model to the framework of lvy - driven , continuous - time arma ( carma ) processes , and use this connection to develop a suitable fitting method , which is illustrated using empirical rainfall data .
the model structure may be interpreted as a non - clustered poisson model with multiple cell types , cf .
the main benefit of this model is its parsimonious formulation based on a stochastic integral , making it suitable for applications where mathematical tractability and fitting methodology are of primary importance .
second , we derive a formula specifying the so - called risk - neutral distribution of a general class of lvy - driven stochastic processes , which includes our model as a special case .
we then use this result to calculate prices for rainfall futures based on our model .
rainfall derivatives were introduced at the chigago merchantile exchange ( cme ) in 2010 , as a recent addition to the class of weather - related products .
these products have a large potential market in all economic sectors that depend on favourable weather conditions , such as farming and energy development .
the literature on rainfall derivatives pricing is currently rather limited .
because the underlying rainfall can not be traded directly , the rainfall derivative market is incomplete , and thus there is no single fixed price for the derivative . due to this incompleteness
, there are several distinct methods that can be used for rainfall derivative pricing .
it appears that most current approaches rely on either the utility indifference approach or risk - neutral pricing using the esscher transform .
the utility indifference approach is used in @xcite . in this paper a modification of the poisson - cluster model is considered , which makes the rainfall intensity a markov jump process , thus enabling maximum likelihood estimation .
this modification relies on the assumption that the data used , though inevitably discrete , approximates continuous - time observations of the rainfall intensity .
@xcite also use the utility indifference approach for pricing hypothetical rainfall derivatives in kenya , based on a markov - gamma model with seasonality .
a natural choice for pricing based on lvy process models is the esscher transform @xcite , as it is structure - preserving @xcite and moreover gives rise to a minimal entropy martingale measure @xcite .
@xcite use the esscher transform for pricing based on a version of the daily rainfall model by @xcite .
they fit simulated monthly rainfall totals to a normal inverse gaussian distribution , and use the esscher transform to obtain a risk - neutral distribution .
@xcite also use the esscher transform for pricing , but base their underlying rainfall model on an independent increment process .
in contrast to the markov - gamma and independent increment models that have been used for pricing rainfall derivatives , our proposed model has the advantage of not making assumptions about temporal independence or markovianity of the rainfall process increments . furthermore , the model and the fitting method used are based on the assumption that the available data represents accumulated rainfall , i.e.  the instantaneous intensity can not be directly observed , which is typically the case for applications . by allowing for temporal dependence and considering carma processes of arbitrary order
, we obtain a model with a flexible autocorrelation structure , which is particularly relevant for data on finer time scales .
this flexibility is illustrated by fitting the model to hourly rainfall data .
we also compare our model to that given in @xcite , which was used in @xcite for pricing rainfall futures based on daily data from detroit .
this paper is structured as follows : section 2 discusses characteristic features of the rainfall process in light of data from different locations and time scales .
section 3 presents the rainfall model and shows how it fits into the continuous - time arma ( carma ) model framework .
section 4 gives details on the fitting method , and section 5 investigates the model performance using empirical data . in section 6
we derive a method for pricing rainfall derivatives based on our model .
in this section we motivate the structure of our model by illustrating some of the characterising features of rainfall time series .
we base this illustration on two data sets which will be used throughout this paper : the first consists of hourly accumulated rainfall amounts at heathrow ( uk ) over the years 1980 - 2012 , provided by the @xcite .
the second data set gives daily accumulated rainfall amounts in detroit ( us ) over the years 1980 - 2010 , provided by bloomberg professional service .
figure [ detroit_heathrow_3yrs ] shows the rainfall time series for both locations over the years 2008 - 2010 .
these plots illustrate that the rainfall process is subject to sudden transitions between periods with little or no rain and periods of higher intensity , causing the large spikes in the graph .
there is also a large amount of zero values in both data sets , as shown in table [ zerotable ] .
because the data is rounded to the nearest unit of measurement ( @xmath0 mm for the heathrow data and @xmath1 inch for the detroit data ) , these zero values represent all data points with a value smaller than this unit .
the proportion of zero values is dependent on the measurement time scale , with fewer zero values for the daily data .
this is because periods with no rainfall must persist throughout the measurement time interval in order to induce a value of zero in the data .
.percentage of rainfall measurements equal to zero . [ cols='<,<,<,<',options='header ' , ]
we have introduced a new class of continuous - time stochastic processes , driven by the hougaard lvy process , and shown how it can be used to construct a parsimonious and analytically tractable model for rainfall . by generalising the ornstein - uhlenbeck process representing rainfall intensity to a continuous - time arma ( carma ) process
, we obtain a model with a very flexible autocorrelation structure .
we presented a general fitting method for this class which exploits a correspondence between integrated carma and arma processes .
we showed that the model fits the marginal distribution of the rainfall very well on both hourly and daily time scales .
in particular , the marginal fit for daily rainfall is better than that of the standard model described in @xcite , and we also obtain an adequate fit to the mean and marginal distribution on a month - by - month basis .    by virtue of the carma generalisation , the extended model manages to accurately reproduce the autocorrelation structure of the observed rainfall , a characterising feature of the process which becomes increasingly significant for smaller time scales .
the last part of the paper gives a result specifying the risk - neutral expectation of a function of the rainfall process , which can be used for pricing general derivatives written on a precipitation index . to construct a risk - neutral measure we use the esscher transform , with a time - dependent parameter representing the risk premium .
we state the result for a general moving average process , a class which includes our model as a special case .
the pricing methodology constitutes an important generalisation of the independent increment model considered in @xcite , which does not allow for price dynamics of derivatives .
we illustrated the pricing method by calculating futures prices based on empirical daily rainfall data from detroit , and showed how they can be calibrated to observed prices .
given a sufficient amount of price data , one can study the properties of the market price of risk ( mpr ) that is implied by this calibration . @xcite discuss the market price of weather risk , focusing on temperature derivatives , and provides an example of modelling the mpr of temperature derivatives as a deterministic function of the seasonal temperature variation .
as the market for rainfall derivatives matures , one could conduct a similar study for the mpr of rainfall derivatives .

"it is well known that in four space - time dimensions black holes satisfy the uniqueness theorem .
the theorem states that asymptotically flat non - degenerate black holes in einstein - maxwell theory are uniquely characterized by the global charges such as the mass , the angular momentum and the electric charge .
rotating black holes with electric charge are described by the kerr - newman solution , which is known in closed form .    in higher dimensions
this is no longer the case .
the schwarzschild , the reissner - nordstrm , and the kerr metric have closed - form generalizations .
but the rotating and electrically charged black hole in higher dimensional einstein - maxwell theory is not known analytically .
nevertheless , other analytical solutions have been obtained in more general theories .
one of these examples is found when a chern - simons term is added to the einstein - maxwell action in five dimensions @xcite . for a specific value of the chern - simons coupling ( supergravity ) , the general rotating and electrically charged black holes are known analytically .
a subset of these solutions are the bmpv black holes @xcite .
these black holes have vanishing angular velocity , but they are not static since the total angular momentum does not vanish .
in this paper we are interested in the generalization of these emcs black holes to general cs coupling constant .
since no general analytical solution is known , we will use numerical methods to generate the black holes and study their properties .
in addition to the numerical methods , we can obtain some properties of extremal emcs black holes if we study near - horizon solutions in the entropy function formalism @xcite .
in particular we will be interested in the solutions obtained when the cs coupling is greater than two times the supergravity value .
we will see that for these values of the cs coupling , an interesting new family of solutions is found @xcite .
let us start presenting the theory and ansatz .
einstein - maxwell - chern - simons theory in five dimensions has the following action :    @xmath0,\ ] ]    where @xmath1 is the curvature scalar and @xmath2 is the gauge potential with field strength tensor @xmath3 .
@xmath4 is the cs coupling parameter which in principle is free .
minimal 5-dimensional gauged supergravity is found for @xmath5 .
we choose the normalization so that @xmath6 . here
we are interested in asymptotically flat space - times . from this action
we obtain the field equations : @xmath7      we are interested in the 5-dimensional generalization of the kerr - newmann black holes , i.e. , stationary black holes with spherical horizon topology and axial symmetry .
hence the space - time has the killing vectors @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is a time - like coordinate , and @xmath12 , @xmath13 are two angular coordinates related to the two axes of rotation .
we restrict the black holes to have both angular momenta of equal magnitude , @xmath14 .
this means that the symmetry is enhanced to cohomogeneity-1 configurations .
all theses properties can be parametrized with the following ansatz for the metric @xmath15 where @xmath16 $ ] , @xmath17 $ ] and @xmath18 $ ] .
in addition , the ansatz for the gauge potential is @xmath19 the unknown metric and gauge potential functions depend only on the radial coordinate @xmath20 , which we will assume to be a quasi - isotropic radial coordinate .
the event horizon is located at @xmath21 , where @xmath22 . and
in particular extremal black holes are characterized by @xmath23 , @xmath24 .
black holes can be characterized by several properties like their global charges .
the existence of a time - like and angular killing vectors allows us to use the the komar formula to obtain the total mass @xmath25 and angular momentum @xmath26 of a configuration @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 , @xmath30 .
we can also calculate the electric charge @xmath31 of the black hole , @xmath32 where @xmath33 .
the event horizon rotates with angular velocity @xmath34 , defined as @xmath35    other quantities of interest are related to the event horizon .
for example , the area of the event horizon @xmath36 and the horizon angular momentum @xmath37 are given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 represents the surface of the horizon .
we define the horizon angular momenta @xmath37 by the komar expression evaluated at the horizon .
note that equal - magnitude total angular momenta , @xmath40 , implies equal horizon angular momenta , @xmath41 .
also note that the area is related to the entropy : @xmath42 .
let us assume that the extremal black holes with event horizon of spherical topology have a near - horizon space - time with isometries given by @xmath44 .
an ansatz incorporating these symmetries @xcite is @xmath45 \\
\nonumber & + & v_2\eta[d\varphi_1+d\varphi_2+\cos{2\theta}(d\varphi_2-d\varphi_1)-\alpha \hat{r } dt]^2.\end{aligned}\ ] ] note that the horizon is at @xmath46 . for the gauge potential
we write @xmath47 the ansatz is described by the constant parameters @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .
these parameters satisfy some constraints which can be obtained from the field equations , or equivalently from the near - horizon formalism .
the algebraic relations are @xmath54 and leave two undetermined parameters , which can be related to the angular momentum @xmath26 and the electric charge @xmath31 of the extremal black hole .
these two charges can be calculated using the associated noether charges @xcite .
the angular momentum @xmath26 is @xmath55 and the electric charge @xmath31 is @xmath56    we can calculate some horizon charges , such as the horizon angular momentum ( from the komar formula ) and horizon area : @xmath57
to obtain global solutions , we solve the emcs equations numerically .
we specify the usual boundary conditions for regular event horizon and asymptotic flatness .
we use a numerical package implementing a collocation method for boundary - value ordinary differential equations , with an adaptive mesh selection procedure @xcite .
let us present results for @xmath58 and fixed electric charge @xmath59 .
the properties obtained for these parameters are generic for other values of @xmath60 and @xmath43 .
the introduction of the cs term makes the theory no longer invariant under changes of sign of @xmath31 , for a fixed @xmath4 .
for instance consider @xmath61
. solutions . in figure
[ fig1 ] we can see that black holes with negative electric charge and @xmath43 have always a finite horizon area , and charged non - static solutions can be connected continuously with the charged static solution by continuously decreasing the angular momentum .
it can be demonstrated that the near - horizon solutions correspond one to one with the global solutions .
black holes with @xmath62 are completely different . a singular configuration with zero area is always found at some finite angular momentum .
this corresponds to the peaks around @xmath63 in figure [ fig1 ] .
black holes with a larger @xmath64 have finite horizon area , and again the near - horizon solutions correspond one to one with the global solutions . in figure [ fig1 ] it can be seen that for values of @xmath64 between the singular solutions , a complicated branch structure is found .
the structure contains cusps @xmath65}$ ] , where the mass reaches a local maximum , but also of the area .
the structure also contains branching points @xmath66},b^*_{[i , j]}$ ] , where two different solutions with the same global charges coexist .
the two solutions can be distinguished by their values of the horizon parameters ( area , horizon angular momentum ) .
this branch structure repeats an infinite number of times .
note that in the branch structure , we find non - static @xmath67 solutions , and we have labeled them with an integer number @xmath68 .
this number corresponds to the number of nodes of the functions @xmath69 and @xmath70 , and they can be understood as radially excited solutions .
the mass of these solutions increases discretely towards the mass of the static black hole .
surprisingly , the near - horizon solution of this family of solutions is always the same .      in figure [ fig2 ]
we present the domain of existence of the black holes we have considered , representing @xmath31 and @xmath26 scaled to the mass .
note that for positive @xmath31 , we have the branch structure of extremal solutions containing the radially excited black holes .
these extremal black holes do not form the boundary of the domain of existence .
in fact because of this , we can easily see in figure [ fig2 ] that there are non - extremal black holes with the same global quantities as these extremal solutions .
in particular , we show solutions with @xmath71 , intersecting in multiple points the extremal solutions .
hence , we can find two types of non - uniqueness .
in the previous section we have seen non - uniqueness between extremal solutions ( @xmath72 and @xmath73 ) , at the branching points of figure [ fig1 ] ) .
now we can see that there is also non - uniqueness between extremal and non - extremal solutions .
in addition we find that one near - horizon solution can correspond to only one global solution , multiple ( even infinite ) global solutions , or no global solution at all .

"the quantized conductance @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , through a narrow quantum point contact was discovered in 1988 @xcite .
this quantization can be understood within a one - dimensional ( 1d ) non - interacting electron gas picture , see e.g. ref.@xcite . in the present work we are interested in a deviation from the integer quantization .
this deviation , the so called `` 0.7 anomaly '' has been found in experimental works @xcite . the anomaly is a shoulder - like feature or a narrow plateau at @xmath4 .
the recent work @xcite demonstrates that the anomaly evolves down to @xmath5 in longer quantum contacts .
another highly interesting recent experimental development is an indication of the above barrier excitation @xcite .
the excitation is probably related to the `` 0.7 anomaly '' .
there is practically no doubt that the structure is due to the interaction between the electrons .
there have been numerous attempts to explain the `` 0.7 anomaly '' by spontaneous magnetization of the 1d quantum wire due to exchange coulomb interaction @xcite .
a somewhat similar , but still different idea is to explain the anomaly by formation of a two - electron bound state with total spin @xmath6 , see refs .
@xcite .
it is not clear why the spontaneous magnetization scenario can be valid since it contradicts to the rigorous lieb - mattis theorem @xcite .
the theorem claims that any 1d many - body system with quadratic kinetic energy and with a potential interaction has the ground state with zero spin .
the same argument is applicable to the s=1 bound state picture . strictly speaking
in the later case one can avoid a formal contradiction with the theorem saying that the bound state is localized somewhere in the transition region between the 2d or 3d conductor and the 1d wire .
however this scenario seems unlikely and in the present work i consider only s=0 ground state in accordance with lieb - mattis theorem .    the effect of wigner crystallization in low density 2d and 3d electron gas is well known .
there is no such a thing as an ideal 1d wigner crystal because quantum fluctuations destroy any long range order .
however it was pointed out some time ago @xcite that impurities suppress the fluctuations and pin the 1d wigner crystal .
surprisingly this happens at pretty high density of electrons @xmath7 : @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the bohr radius .
a quantum contact ( = short quantum wire ) is not uniform and hence it pins the crystal .
this must result in nontrivial behavior of the contact conductance .
it is the effect we study in the present work using the hartree - fock ( hf ) method .
we demonstrate that the effect results in the conductance anomaly at @xmath10 for a short contact and in several anomalies for longer contacts . in the present work we consider only zero temperature case .
however in conclusions we comment on temperature dependence .
the idea of relation between the conductance anomaly and the wigner crystallization was also suggested in a recent paper @xcite .
authors of this paper discuss a ferromagnetic state embedded in the wigner crystal .
we follow the different way considering the ground state with total spin zero in accordance with lieb - mattis theorem .    in independent particle approximation , i.e. in the case of an ideal electron gas , a calculation of the conductance for a given transverse channel is straightforward . assuming adiabatic transmission one gets @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the barrier transmission probability at fermi energy @xcite . in the case of interacting particles
this formula is also valid because before and after the potential barrier the density of electrons is high enough , and hence the interaction is negligible .
however one can not use the single particle description to calculate the transmission probability @xmath12 because in the vicinity of the barrier the electron density is low , and hence the many - body effects are very important .
the main question is how to calculate the transmission probability @xmath12 ? to do this
we apply the following trick .
consider the liquid of electrons on a 1d ring with a potential barrier somewhere on the ring .
there is no a current in the ground state of the system .
now let us apply a magnetic flux through the ring .
this flux induces the electric current . on the one hand
the current is related to the barrier transmission probability @xmath12 . on the other hand
, the current can be calculated using the hf method .
this allows us to find @xmath12 with account of many - body effects .
structure of the present paper is the following : the relation between the current on the ring and the transmission probability is derived in sec .
ii . in sec .
iii we demonstrate how the hartree - fock method describes development of the charge - density wave at low electron density .
the results of selfconsistent calculations of the transmission probabilities for different barriers are presented in sec .
v summarizes the results and presents our conclusions .
let us consider a single particle in a potential @xmath13 .
the potential is localized near @xmath14 , @xmath15 at @xmath16 . for simplicity
we assume that the potential is symmetric , @xmath17 . in the scattering problem
the wave function outside the region of the potential is of the form @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the momentum of the particle , @xmath20 is the reflection amplitude and @xmath21 is the transmission amplitude . throughout the paper we set the electron mass , electric charge , and the planck constant equal to unity , @xmath22 .
the transmission probability is @xmath23 .
one can also use the basis of standing waves .
since the potential is symmetric , there is one symmetric and one antisymmetric solution at a given energy @xmath24 @xmath25 comparing eqs .
( [ psi1 ] ) and ( [ psi2 ] ) one can express the transmission and reflection amplitudes in terms of the scattering phases @xmath26 where @xmath27    now we switch the vector potential @xmath28 on @xmath29 and close the ring imposing the periodic boundary condition @xmath30 we will assume that the length of the ring @xmath31 is much larger than the size of the region where the potential @xmath13 is nonzero : @xmath32 .
note that the vector potential we introduce is the pure gauge one .
we need it to induce the orbital current in the ring .
the magnetic field is zero .
the induced current depends only on the bohm - aharonov phase @xmath33 . in the many - body problem
the current has period @xmath34 .
the current is maximum at @xmath35 . for further considerations we take the first maximum @xmath36    solution of the schrdinger equation with hamiltonian ( [ h1]),([aa ] ) and the periodic boundary condition ( [ per ] ) gives the following single electron wave functions outside of the region of the potential . @xmath37 here @xmath38 , @xmath39 and the momentum @xmath40 obeys the following quantization condition @xmath41 there are two solutions : @xmath42 and @xmath43 . to elucidate meaning of these solutions
let us look at two limiting cases .
the first limit is an infinitely high potential barrier , @xmath44 . in this case
the scattering phases are equal , @xmath45 . substituting these phases into eqs .
( [ apm ] ) , ( [ psi3 ] ) one finds that the wave functions @xmath46 coincide with symmetric and antisymmetric standing waves ( [ psi2 ] ) . in the second limit
there is no barrier , @xmath47
. then the scattering phases are the following : @xmath48 , @xmath49 .
one can prove that in this case the states ( [ psi3 ] ) describe clockwise and anti - clockwise rotations , @xmath50 , @xmath51 .
the quantization condition ( [ quant ] ) gives the following momenta @xmath52 and energy levels @xmath53 using the wave functions ( [ psi3 ] ) one easily finds the electric current in each single particle state @xmath54    up to now we were considering the single particle problem .
now let us consider the many body problem .
to do this we fill all the single particle states up to the fermi energy .
each orbital state is filled by two electrons , spin up and spin down .
electric currents @xmath55 and @xmath56 partly compensate each other , so the total electric current of the many - body system is @xmath57\nonumber\\ & = & { { 2\pi}\over{l^2}}\sum_m\left[k{{d\sin\delta}\over{dk}}+\sin\delta\right ] = { { 2\pi}\over{l^2}}\sum_m { { d(k\sin\delta)}\over{dk } } = { { 1}\over{l}}\int_0^{k_f}{{d(k\sin\delta)}\over{dk}}dk= { { k_f}\over{l}}\sin\delta_f={{\pi n}\over{2l^2}}\sin\delta_f.\end{aligned}\ ] ] here @xmath58 is the number of electrons on the ring , @xmath59 is the fermi momentum , and @xmath60 is the scattering phase @xmath61 , see eq .
( [ dd ] ) , taken at the fermi energy .
( [ jjj ] ) gives the main tool we use in the present work .
first we solve numerically the many body problem on the ring without the barrier , @xmath47 , and find the electric current @xmath62 .
second we solve numerically the many body problem with the barrier , @xmath63 , and find the electric current @xmath64 . then using eqs .
( [ jjj ] ) and ( [ abt ] ) we conclude that the transmission probability at the fermi energy is @xmath65 this is exactly the transmission probability we need for the conductance ( [ gt ] ) .    in the derivation of eqs .
( [ jjj ] ) and ( [ tt ] ) we neglect electron - electron interaction outside the potential barrier .
this is valid if the density of electrons is high enough . in the vicinity of the barrier
the electron density is low and hence the electron - electron interaction is very important .
this does not contradict to the presented derivation .
the information about the electron - electron interaction is hidden in the scattering phases .
finally we would like to comment on the luttinger liquid behavior that is related to the long - range fluctuations in the 1d interacting fermi gas .
the hf method we use to analyze the electron ring certainly does not take into account the long - range fluctuations .
however this is irrelevant to the calculation of the barrier transmission probability .
the matter is that the number of electrons above the quantum barrier is not more than several , so there is no room for the long - range fluctuations within the barrier .
the long ring outside the barrier is just a technical trick to describe the reservoir of electrons .
there is no need to take into account the long - range fluctuations in the reservoir .
the hamiltonian of the many body system we consider is of the form @xmath66+{1\over{2}}\sum_{i , j } v(x_i , x_j),\ ] ] where indexes @xmath67 and @xmath68 numerates electrons , @xmath69 is the periodic coordinate ( @xmath70 ) , @xmath28 is the gauge field ( [ aa ] ) , @xmath13 is the potential barrier , and @xmath71 is the electron - electron interaction .
we use atomic units , so coordinates are measured in unites of bohr radius , @xmath72 , and energies are measured in units of @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the effective electron mass and @xmath75 is the dielectric constant . for experimental conditions of works
@xcite these values are the following : @xmath76 , @xmath77 .
the electron - electron coulomb repulsion we take in the form @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the effective width of the transverse channel , and @xmath80 is the length of the shortest arc between the points @xmath81 and @xmath82 on the ring , see comment @xcite .
the transverse motion of electrons is frozen due to some confining potential that can be approximated as @xmath83 according to the data @xcite the energy splitting between the transverse channels is @xmath84 .
this gives the following value of the first channel transverse size @xmath85 averaging over the oscillator wave function of the transverse motion shows that the effective 1d coulomb interaction is well approximated by eq .
( [ vij ] ) .
we stress that the value of @xmath79 is close to the critical distance between the electrons at which the wigner crystallization occurs @xcite .
this is a fortunate coincidence .
larger value of @xmath79 would suppress the conductance anomaly , and this really happens in higher transverse channels .
substantially smaller value of @xmath79 would require a theoretical technique more sophisticated than the hf method employed in the present work .
we will discuss this point later .
let us also comment on the long - range behavior of the interaction ( [ vij ] ) . because of the ring geometry the interaction ( [ vij ] ) at @xmath86 is somewhat different from the coulomb one .
however the so long range tail of the interaction does not influence the results . anyway in a real system there is a screening by gates and many other effects that influence the long range tail .
what is important is that at the size of the barrier @xmath87 the interaction ( [ vij ] ) has the right form , @xmath88 .    in
the hf method the many body wave function of the system ( [ hmb ] ) is represented in the form of slater determinant of single particle orbitals @xmath89 .
each orbital obeys the equation @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the single particle energy and @xmath92 is the hf hamiltonian @xmath93 here the summation is performed over all filled orbitals . to avoid misunderstanding we have to comment on a terminological question .
usually only the case of zero vector potential , @xmath94 , is called the hf method . if @xmath95 the method is called the hartree - fock method in the external field , or if @xmath28 is time dependent it is called the time dependent hartree - fock method @xcite .
the external field method is equivalent to the random phase approximation ( rpa ) .
a crucial point is that the external field hartree - fock method ( = rpa ) is gauge invariant , and therefore the electric current calculated within this method is conserved @xcite .    for computations we use a ring of length @xmath96 with a finite grid of 400 or 600 points .
a naive finite grid version of the hamiltonian ( [ hhf ] ) has a weak dependence on the gauge and hence the electric current is not exactly conserved . to avoid this minor trouble we use the lattice ( = grid ) modification of the hamiltonian ( [ hhf ] ) replacing @xmath97 by @xmath98/2h^2 $ ] . here
@xmath99 is the step of the grid and @xmath100 is the wave function on the site @xmath7 of the grid .
the electric current corresponding to the grid hamiltonian is @xmath101.\ ] ] this current is exactly conserved at a finite @xmath99 , and at @xmath102 it coincides with the standard electric current .
first we consider the impurity pinned wigner crystallization @xcite .
the electron density on the ring found as a result of the self consistent solution of the hf equations without any impurity , @xmath103 , is plotted in fig.1 by long dashed lines .
we consider the total number of electrons @xmath104 , @xmath105 .
the density is homogeneous .
the density with the external potential @xmath106 at @xmath107 , @xmath108 , and @xmath109 are shown by solid lines .
it is clearly seen that the impurity pinned charge density wave is developed at the electron density @xmath110 . for comparison
, we also show by dashed lines the results obtained in the hartree approximation ( no exchange interaction ) .
the hartree approximation also gives the charge density wave but underestimates the effect .
in real wigner crystal spins are localized at the sites of the lattice .
this spin structure certainly can not be obtained in the hf approximation that enforces zero spin density at any point .
however we are not going to study a real wigner crystal at very low electron density .
anyway such a state does not conduct an electric current .
we are interested in @xmath111 .
the charge density wave at @xmath112 is only a precursor for the wigner crystallization and this precursor can be described in the hf approximation .    in obtaining the results presented on fig.1
we have used the transverse cutoff @xmath113 , see eqs .
( [ vij]),([at ] ) . at the smaller value of @xmath79
the charge density wave is developed at a higher electron density .
this reflects the fact that the hf method with the ideal coulomb interaction overestimates the tendency towards the charge density waves .
fortunately the value of @xmath114 compensates this overestimation giving the correct value of the `` critical '' density @xcite .
this is why the application of the hartee - fock method is justified .
we also performed hf calculations with total spin @xmath115 .
technically it is very simple , we just set @xmath116 .
the macroscopic magnetization , i.e. @xmath117 , does not arise .
however , it is interesting to note that at the low electron density , @xmath118 , the ground state with @xmath6 or @xmath119 sometimes has slightly lower energy than the state with @xmath120 .
this clearly contradicts to the rigorous lieb - mattis theorem @xcite and therefore it is just a byproduct of the hf approximation .
we disregard this result and consider only the states with @xmath120 .
for calculations in this section we take the number of electrons on the ring @xmath121 , @xmath105 .
this corresponds to the average electron density @xmath122 that is well above the charge density wave threshold .
the external potential barrier is taken in the form ( [ uu ] ) .
the parameter @xmath123 models the gate potential in the experiments @xcite .
selfconsistent solution of the hf eqs .
( [ hf ] ) is performed at @xmath124 and at @xmath125 and then the transmission probability is found using eq .
( [ tt ] ) . the transmission probability as a function of @xmath123 at @xmath126 and the values of the barrier length @xmath127
is plotted in fig.2 .
= 10.7 cm    the plot of @xmath12 versus @xmath123 is representative if @xmath128 .
however in the computations @xmath96 and therefore the inequality is not so strong . as a result
the fermi energy attains a weak @xmath123 dependence . to compensate this effect , in fig.3 we plot the transmission probability @xmath12 versus the value of @xmath129 that models the gate potential more accurately .
= 10.7 cm    there is no a qualitative difference between fig.2 and fig.3 , but fig.3 is more correct quantitatively .
there are some very sharp structures in fig.2 and fig.3 , but they arise only because of the relatively large step in @xmath123 .
the computations are rather time consuming and this limits the number of points .
for comparison we present in fig.4 the same plots as in fig.3 , but the curves have been obtained in the hartree approximation .
so the exchange term in eq .
( [ hhf ] ) has been dropped out .
= 10.7 cm    the results of hartree approximation are qualitatively similar to that of the hf approximation , fig.3 .
however all the structures are less pronounced .
the previous figures present the barrier transmission probability calculated at the parameter @xmath126 , see eq .
( [ uu ] ) .
in fig.5 and fig.6 we plot the similar results at @xmath109 .
the fig.5 corresponds to the hf approximation and fig.6 corresponds to the hartree approximation .
= 10.7 cm    = 10.7 cm    the hartree approximation gives results qualitatively similar to that of the hf approximation , but the hartree approximation clearly underestimates the structure .
fig.3 and fig.5 clearly demonstrate a shoulder at the value of the transmission probability @xmath130 . for longer barriers an additional structure appears at smaller values of @xmath12 .
this is in agreement with experimental data @xcite .
we remind that we use the unit of length @xmath76 , so the typical length of barriers presented in fig.3 and fig.5 is between @xmath131 and @xmath132 .    to understand the reason for the structures in the transmission probability we plot the effective selfconsistent potential @xmath133 ( see eq .
( [ hhf ] ) ) and the electron density above the barrier at parameters corresponding to these structures .
the point a in fig.5 indicates the shoulder at @xmath134 for the barrier of the length @xmath135 , the parameters are : @xmath135 , @xmath109 , @xmath136 .
the corresponding selfconsistent potential is shown in fig.7 by the solid line , the external potential ( [ uu ] ) is shown by the dashed line .
= 10.cm    for an estimate
the external potential in fig.7 can be approximated near the top by a parabola , @xmath137 , with @xmath138 .
this gives the ratio of the typical longitudinal size to the typical transverse size of the contact , @xmath139 , see also eq .
( [ at ] ) .
however the selfconsistent potential , fig.7 , is very much different from the simple parabola because of redistribution of electrons along the contact .
the selfconsistent potential calculated in the hartree approximation is practically the same as that calculated in the hf approximation .
nevertheless the hf transmission probability has a shoulder at the point a , see fig.5 , and the hartree transmission probability has no a shoulder , see fig.6 .
the difference is due to the exchange interaction . to demonstrate this we plot in fig.8 the electron density above the barrier .
the hf electron density is shown by the solid line , and the hartree electron density is shown by the dashed line .
we see that the shoulder in the transmission probability is related to the charge density wave above the barrier .
there is no a charge density wave in the hartree approximation , and there is no a shoulder in the corresponding transmission probability shown in fig.6 .
= 10.cm    the point c in fig.5 indicates the local minimum at @xmath140 for the barrier of the length @xmath141 , the parameters are : @xmath141 , @xmath109 , @xmath142 .
the corresponding selfconsistent potential is shown in fig.9 by the solid line , the external potential ( [ uu ] ) is shown by the dashed line .
similar to the previous case the hf selfconsistent potential is practically indistinguishable from the hartree one .
nevertheless the hf transmission probability has a well pronounced minimum , see point c in fig.5 , and the hartree transmission probability has just a shoulder , see fig.6 .
the difference is due to the exchange interaction .
the hf electron density is shown in fig.10 by the solid line , and the hartree electron density is shown by the dashed line .
there is an additional modulation of the hf density due to the exchange interaction .
we see that the structures in the transmission probability are related to the resonance structures above the potential barrier .
the resonance structures are related to the charge density waves developing on the barrier when the average electron density above the barrier is of the order of @xmath143 .
the fictitious gauge field method has been developed to calculate a potential barrier transmission probability @xmath12 with account of many - body effects .
the transmission probability is directly related to the conductance , @xmath144 .
the results of the hartree - fock calculations of the transmission probability are shown in fig.3 and fig.5 .
the results demonstrate a plateau or a shoulder at the value of the transmission probability @xmath145 . for longer barriers
this structure is getting weak , but additional structures appear at lower values of @xmath12 .
all the structures are related to the development of the charge density waves on the barrier .
this is a precursor for wigner crystallization .
we believe that this explains the conductance anomalies observed in experiments with quantum contacts @xcite .
we would like to note that there are two further questions that can be studied within the developed fictitious gauge field approach .
the first question is how the structures in the conductance evolve in the external magnetic field .
the experimental data @xcite indicates that the conducatnce anomaly is somehow related to the spin . in the picture considered in the present work the effect is certainly spin dependent because it is due to the exchange interaction . to analyze this problem in details
one should perform calculations at @xmath116 , so the problem is more technically involved compared to the considered case .
another question is the temperature dependence of the anomalies .
it is known from experiment that the effect is increasing with temperature up to @xmath146 .
unfortunately there is no a direct way to consider the finite temperature case within the developed formalism .
however it is clear that any temperature dependence is related to the excitations above the barrier .
moreover there is a direct spectroscopic observation of such excitation @xcite .
the problem of the collective excitation can be addresses within the developed formalism . to approach this problem
one should apply the time dependent hartree - fock method in the external gauge field .
this calculation is substantially more technically involved compared to the considered case .

"the central puzzle of the hole - doped cuprates at low doping is the origin of the  pseudogap '  a suppression in the density of states at the fermi - level below a temperature , @xmath3 and its relation to other symmetry - broken states found at lower temperatures .
most notably , recent experiments on a number of different families of the hole - doped cuprates have detected the onset of an incommensurate charge density wave ( cdw ) state at a temperature , @xmath4 which competes with superconductivity below the superconducting @xmath5 @xcite .
one of the primary motivations behind investigating the nature of the cdw is the hope that a better understanding of this state would lead to a better understanding of the  normal ' state above @xmath5 out of which it emerges .
a number of recent theoretical works @xcite have tried to approach this problem from a weak - coupling approach , where the cdw is interpreted as an instability of a large fermi surface in the presence of strong antiferromagnetic ( afm ) exchange interactions .
there are two fundamental properties associated with a cdw its wavevector , @xmath6 , and its form factor , @xmath7 ,  where the cdw is expressed in real space as a bond - observable , @xmath8 ( @xmath9 annihilates an electron on the cu site @xmath10 with spin @xmath11 ) given by p_ij=_e^i(_i+_j)/2 .
[ dij ] conventional charge density waves have only on - site charge modulation with @xmath7 independent of @xmath12 ; this is not the case in the context of the cuprates .
the experiments on certain families of the cuprates , such as ybco , bscco and na - ccoc , have found strong evidence for the wavevector @xmath6 to be of the form : @xmath13 and @xmath14 , where @xmath15 decreases with increasing hole - doping and is believed to nest portions of a putative large fermi surface in the vicinity of , but away from , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .
moreover , recent phase - sensitive stm experiments @xcite and other x - ray measurements @xcite have unveiled the form factor @xmath7 to be predominantly of a @xmath18wave nature , @xmath19 @xmath20 .
hence , the cdw should be more appropriately referred to as a  bond density ' wave ( bdw ) .
fig.[bdw ] provides an illustration of unidirectional bdws of different types in real space for both commensurate as well as incommensurate wavevectors .
we note in passing that recent x - ray observations @xcite in the la - based cuprates indicate a dominant @xmath21-form factor ( where @xmath22 ) , and this has been ascribed to the presence of magnetic ` stripe ' order in these compounds , and is in agreement with computations in such states @xcite .
further , computations @xcite of density wave instabilities in the presence of commensurate antiferromagnetism show suppression of the @xmath1-form factor with increasing magnetic order .    , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 .
( a)-(c ) we plot the charge modulation for a commensurate wavevector , @xmath25 , while ( d)-(f ) plot the same quantity for an incommensurate wavevector , @xmath26 .
the parameters used are : ( a ) , ( d ) @xmath27 .
( b ) , ( e ) @xmath28 .
( c ) , ( f ) @xmath29 .
we have included phases in the definitions of @xmath30 in order to make the charge distribution 
bond - centered ' for the case of the commensurate wavevector ; however , other choices of the phases are also allowed . ]    without magnetic ordering , the form factor does indeed come out to be predominantly @xmath18wave within all the weak - coupling approaches @xcite .
however , the wavevector of the leading density - wave instability within all of these approaches is always of the diagonal type , @xmath2 .
this feature can be traced back to the absence of a pre - existing gap in the anti - nodal region of the large fermi surface normal state .
it is also related to the remnant of an emergent su(2 ) symmetry associated with afm exchange interactions , that maps particles to holes and vice versa @xcite ; therefore @xmath18wave superconductivity , which is the leading instability in the problem , gets mapped to @xmath18form factor bdw with the diagonal wavevectors . while the diagonal wavevector is a serious drawback of the weak - coupling approaches ,
various scenarios have been proposed under which the experimentally observed state might be favored over the diagonal state @xcite .    here
we shall explore the consequences of gapping out the anti - nodal region by examining the density wave instabilities of a metallic state denoted @xcite the fractionalized fermi liquid ( fl * ) .
an independent related analysis has been carried recently by zhang and mei @xcite using the yang - rice - zhang ( yrz ) ansatz @xcite for the fractionalized metal .
the fl * has similarities to the yrz ansatz @xcite , but as we shall review below , can be derived systematically from microscopic models while keeping careful track of its ` topological ' order @xcite ( see also ref .  ) .
these density wave instabilities were also discussed in refs .  , but without allowance for non - trivial form factors for the density wave .
fl * phases are most conveniently described within multi - band models , such as in kondo lattice models for heavy - fermion systems @xcite or emery - type models suited for the cuprates , where the spins in only one of the bands go into a quantum - disordered ( spin - liquid ) state . in this work
, we shall take a different route that has been adopted earlier in refs.@xcite .
this approach is best understood as follows @xcite : imagine that we start from a metal with long - range afm order , so that the fermi surface has been reconstructed into hole - pockets .
if we now want to describe the loss of antiferromagnetism , then the transitions where the long - range order is lost and the entire fermi surface is recovered need not be coincident .
in particular , it is possible to have two separate transitions , where at the first transition the _ orientational _ order of the afm is lost over long distances , while the magnitude of the afm order remains fixed ; the large fermi surface is recovered at the second transition . therefore , it is possible to have an intermediate phase with a locally well - defined afm order ( over distances of the order of a short correlation length , @xmath31 ) . as we will review below
, this intermediate phase can have hole pockets . because there is no broken symmetry , the luttinger theorem on the fermi surface volume
is violated , but this is permitted because of the presence of topological order @xcite .    , which controls the strength of quantum fluctuations and the carrier density , @xmath32 .
the @xmath33 phases are insulators , and we assume that the insulator has a deconfined quantum critical point @xcite at a @xmath34 . the arrows on the labels of the phases indicate crossovers upon going to lower energies and longer distances . for @xmath33 and @xmath35 , the ground state is an ordered antiferromagnetic insulator , while for @xmath33 and @xmath36 the ground state is a valence bond solid ( vbs ) , which arises as an instability at long confinement scale of a u(1 ) spin - liquid ( sl ) .
the @xmath34 , deconfined quantum critical point , broadens into a  holon ' metal phase above a small , finite @xmath32 .
binding of the emergent spinon and holon excitations in the holon metal phase leads to the fl * phase shown for @xmath36 and non - zero @xmath32 .
we do not discuss the small @xmath32 ( shaded grey ) region in this paper @xcite .
the bdw instabilities of the u(1 ) fl * have a @xmath18form factor and could be relevant for the observations in the non la - based cuprates .
the physical trajectory in the phase diagram ( for the non - la cuprates ) corresponds to not only changing @xmath32 , but also @xmath37 , _ i.e. _ the trajectory runs diagonally .
the eventual confinement transition out of the @xmath18bdw state must occur , and its description remains an important topic for future work . ]    in the context of one - band models linked to the physics of the cuprates , our realization of the fl * state is linked to the analysis presented in ref .  .
we used their and subsequent results @xcite to obtain the global phase diagram presented in fig .
[ phases ] .
the starting point of this phase diagram is a deconfined quantum critical point @xcite in the antiferromagnet at zero doping , while tuning a coupling constant @xmath37 , which measures the degree of  frustration ' in the antiferromagnet .
this critical point is described by a deconfined gauge theory involving a u(1 ) gauge field @xmath38 and relativistic , bosonic @xmath39 spinons @xmath40 which carry the u(1 ) gauge charge . upon doping
the antiferromagnet in the vicinity of this deconfined critical point with charge carriers of density @xmath32 , we have to include a density @xmath32 of spinless fermions ( ` holons ' ) , @xmath41 , which carry gauge charge ( @xmath42 ) under the same @xmath43 gauge field .
the resulting gauge theory for @xmath40 and @xmath41 has a complicated phase diagram as a function of @xmath37 and the hole density , which is sketched in fig .
[ phases ] and will be partly reviewed in section  [ mod ] .
our attention here will focus on the fl * region of fig .
[ phases ] : here the @xmath40 and @xmath41 bind to form gauge - neutral fermions of density @xmath32 , which then form fermi pockets in the brillouin - zone near , but not centered at , @xmath44 .
the total area enclosed by these pockets is @xmath32 , and hence the luttinger volume of @xmath45 is not obeyed , and a fl * phase is realized .    in this paper , we carry out a generalized rpa analysis of a model of this fl * phase interacting via short - range interactions . in most of the parameter space
that we have explored , the leading instability in the particle - hole channel is a bond density wave with predominantly @xmath18form factor whose wavevector nests the tips of the hole - pockets . is high at the tips of the pockets , @xmath46
] this result is a promising step in the direction of identifying essential characteristics of the normal state which are responsible for giving rise to the bdw instability that is observed experimentally in the underdoped cuprates .
the rest of this paper is arranged as follows : we describe and review a particular route towards constructing an fl * state , starting from a one - band model of electrons coupled to the fluctuations of an afm order - parameter in sections [ mod ] and [ fl * ] .
we then setup our computation for determining the charge - ordering instabilities in an fl * interacting via short - range interactions in section [ bs ] .
finally , we describe our results for the nature of the bdw instabilities , with special emphasis on its wavevector and form factor , in section [ res ] and conclude with a future outlook in section [ dis ] .
we review some of the previous analysis of density - wave instabilities in metals with large fermi surfaces interacting via short - range interactions ( @xcite ) in appendix [ fl ] in order to highlight the differences with the main results presented in this paper .
appendix [ coulomb ] contains a brief discussion of density - wave instabilities in the presence of large coulomb repulsion .
we begin by summarizing the arguments @xcite that lead to the phase diagram in fig .
[ phases ] .
the starting point is the theory for the electrons , @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) , hopping on the sites of a square lattice .
the electrons are coupled to the fluctuations of an o(3 ) field , @xmath49 , which describes the local orientation of the antiferromagnetic n@xmath50el order at @xmath51 .
we shall focus on the long - wavelength fluctuations of @xmath49 while retaining the full lattice dispersions for the fermions .
the imaginary time lagrangian , @xmath52 , is given by , _f&=&_i , jc_i^c_j + , + _n&=&d^2  [ ( _ ) ^2+v^2()^2 ] , + _fn&=&_i e^i_i   _ ic_i^ _ c_i .
in the above , @xmath53 represent the hopping matrix elements that give rise to a large fermi surface , @xmath54 represents the chemical potential , @xmath55 is an @xmath56 coupling , @xmath57 represents a characteristic spin - wave velocity and @xmath37 is used to tune the strength of quantum fluctuations associated with the afm order parameter .
the vector @xmath58 satisfies the local constraint @xmath59 .    when @xmath35 , the above model has long - range antiferromagnetic order , @xmath60 ( with a correlation length , @xmath61 ) . in the presence of such long - range order ( lro ) , the large fermi surface breaks up into electron and hole pockets .
the resulting state in the presence of short - range fermionic interactions could be unstable to other symmetry - broken states ; the nature of these instabilities in the particle - hole channel , starting from a reconstructed fermi surface , have been analyzed @xcite . as we noted in section  [ intro ] , this approach leads to density waves with the @xmath1-form factor suppressed @xcite , consistent with recent observations on the la - based cuprates @xcite which do have magnetic order at low temperatures .
our interest in the present paper is on the @xmath62 portion of the phase diagram in fig .
[ phases ] , which we argue is relevant to the physics of the non - la - based cuprates . the deconfined critical point @xmath34 and @xmath33
is expressed not in terms of the @xmath58 fields , but in terms of the spinor @xmath40 , with _
i = z_i^*_z_i and a u(1 ) gauge field @xmath38 .
at the same time @xcite , one tranforms the underlying electrons , @xmath47 , to a new set of spinless fermions , @xmath63 , c_i&=&r_p^i _ ip ,   + r_p^i&= & (    cc z_i & -z_i^ * + z_i & z_i^ *    ) , [ crz ] is a spacetime dependent su(2 ) matrix ( @xmath64 ) and the fermions @xmath63 carry opposite charges @xmath65 under the same emergent u(1 ) gauge transformation .
we begin our discussion of the complex dynamics of @xmath40 and @xmath41 by first considering the effect of non - zero @xmath32 at the critical coupling @xmath34 . at very low hole density
, each @xmath41 fermion can be treated independently of all the others , while interacting with the deconfined gauge theory described by @xmath40 and @xmath38 . as shown in ref .
, there is an ` orthogonality catastrophe ' and each @xmath41 fermion is effectively localized by the critical fluctuations .
we are not interested here in the very small values of @xmath32 at which this localization happens , and so will not discuss it further ; it is also excluded from fig .  [ phases ] ( shown as the grey - shaded region ) . moving to higher hole densities , we can assume the holons form a fermi surface , and this can then quench the @xmath38 fluctuations via landau damping @xcite ; the holon fermi surface is then stable , field , condensation of which leads to the holon superconductor @xcite . ] and we obtain the holon metal shown in fig .
[ phases ] .
let us now turn to @xmath36 .
now there is at least one additional length scale , the spin correlation length , @xmath31 .
this length should be compared with the spacing between the holons @xmath66 .
there is actually another significant scale , the length scale at which landau - damping of the photon sets in ; this also diverges as @xmath67 , and for simplicity we will ignore its difference from the spacing between the holons .
when @xmath68 , we revert to the @xmath34 situation described in the previous paragraph .
however , for @xmath69 , we have to first consider the influence of a non - zero @xmath31 on the gauge theory of the deconfined critical point .
as described in refs .
, here we crossover to a coulomb phase in which the @xmath38 field mediates a logarithmic coulomb force .
this coulomb force binds the @xmath40 and @xmath41 quanta into gauge - neutral fermions @xcite ( an additional attractive force is also provided by the `` shraiman - siggia term '' @xcite ) . at longer scales , these gauge - neutral fermions start to notice each other via the pauli principle , and so they form fermi surfaces leading to the fl * state of interest here .    at even longer length scales we have to consider confinement effects from monopoles in the @xmath38 gauge field , which are not suppressed in the fl * regime ( but monopoles
are suppressed in the holon metal ) .
this we will not do here , leaving it as a difficult but important problem for future study .      as discussed in section [ intro ] and in refs .
, the emergent photon gives rise to binding of the @xmath41 fermions and the @xmath40 spinons into gauge - neutral objects .
however , there are two such combinations , f_i~z_i_i+ ,  g_i~_z^*_i_i- , where @xmath70 is the unit antisymmetric tensor .
the physical electronic operator has a non - zero overlap with both of these , c_iz(f_i+g_i ) , where @xmath71 is a quasiparticle renormalization factor that is nonlocal over @xmath31 ; this expression differs from the bare relationship in eq .
( [ crz ] ) because we are now dealing with fully renormalized quasiparticles @xcite . over distances that are larger than @xmath31 ,
where there is no net afm order , the @xmath72 and @xmath73 fermions preferentially , but not exclusively , reside on the different sublattice sites .    based on symmetry considerations alone , we can write the following effective hamiltonian for @xmath74 and @xmath75 , h_=&-&_i , j t_ij(f_i^f_j + g_i^g_j ) + _ i e^i_i(f_i^f_i - g_i^g_i ) + & - & _ i , j_ij(f_i^g_j + g_i^f_j ) . once again , the @xmath53 represent the hopping matrices corresponding to a large fermi surface , @xmath55 represents the potential due to the local afm order ( at distances shorter than @xmath31 ) .
the terms proportional to @xmath76 represent the analogs of the  shraiman - siggia ' ( ss ) terms @xcite which couple the @xmath77 and @xmath78 particles . in the absence of these terms , but with @xmath79 , one obtains hole - like pockets centered at @xmath80 .
however , when the ss terms are finite , the pockets can be shifted away from these special points .
it is more convenient now to change basis to a new set of fermionic operators , c_=(f_+g _ ) ,  d_=(f_+-g_+ ) , so that the physical electronic operator @xmath81 .
the revised hamiltonian then reads , h_= _ , [ heff ] where the dispersions , @xmath82 are given by , _
^+&=&_+ _ ,  _
^-=_- _ , + _ & = & -2t_1((k_x)+(k_y))-4t_2(k_x)(k_y ) + & & -2t_3((2k_x)+(2k_y))- , + _ & = & -_0-_1((k_x)+(k_y ) ) .
the green s function for the electronic operator can be obtained from the hamiltonian in eqn.[heff ] and is given by @xcite , g^c(,)&=&. [ acl ]    it is more transparent to rewrite the above green s function in the following form , g^c(,)&=&_= ,   + ( ) ^-1&= & 1 + , + e_^&=&. in the limit where @xmath83 , one recovers the original large fermi surface , @xmath84 .
based on the analysis above , we have arrived at a description of the electronic excitations which have been renormalized by the quantum fluctuations of the antiferromagnet . a natural question that we need to address now is whether the resulting state is unstable to other symmetry - broken phases in the presence of short - range interactions .
we shall address this question by studying the effect of short - range coulomb repulsion and af exchange interaction acting on top of the fl * phase , described by , h_c&=&u_i c_i^c_i c_i^c_i + _ i < jv_ij c_i^c_i c_j^c_j , + h_j&=&_i < j _
_  c_i^c_ic_j^c_j .
[ hjhc ]    the notation that we shall use to define the interaction parameters from now on is as follows : @xmath85 , where @xmath86 denotes whether @xmath87 are @xmath88 , @xmath89 , or , @xmath90 nearest neighbors .    let us now look for the possible charge - ordering instabilities .
we will consider the effect of first , second and third neighbor coulomb and exchange interactions ( @xmath19 @xmath91 with @xmath92 ) .
our generalized order parameter in the particle - hole channel , @xmath7 , at a wavevector @xmath6 can be defined as follows ( as in eqn.[dij ] ) : c_i^c_j= _ e^i(_i+_j)/2 .
it is useful to expand @xmath7 in terms of a set of orthonormal basis functions @xmath93 as , p_()= _ _ ( ) _ ( ) , where we choose a set of @xmath94 orthonormal basis functions , as described in table [ tabbas ] .
.basis functions , @xmath93 , used for determining the symmetry of the charge - ordering instability .
[ cols='^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^',options='header ' , ]     the basis functions from @xmath95 preserve time - reversal symmetry , while the ones from @xmath96 spontaneously break time - reversal symmetry .
the remainder of our analysis will be carried out using the t - matrix formalism developed in ref.@xcite to determine the structure of the charge - ordering instability .
the first step in this procedure involves expressing the interaction terms in eqn.[hjhc ] as , & & h_j+h_c=_,,_=0 ^ 12_()_( ) , where @xmath97 represent various interaction parameters , as summarised in table [ tabbas ] .    after summing all the ladder diagrams in the particle - hole channel , we obtain ( see fig.[co ] ) , t_m()&=&(_+ _ ) _ m-2_,0_m,0w ( ) + & + & _ n=0 ^
12(_+ _ ) _ n ( ) t_nm()- _ , 0_n=0 ^ 12w ( ) _ 0,n ( ) t_nm ( ) , [ tlm ] where , w()_=0
^ 12__(0 ) _
( ) arises from the direct interaction , and the polarizabilities are given by , _
m()&=&2__()_m ( ) _ ( ) , + _ ( ) & = & _ , = z^_+/2 z^_-/2 . in the above
, @xmath98 represents the fermi - dirac distribution function .    .
]    from eqn.[tlm ] , it is straightforward to see that the charge - ordering instability is determined by the lowest eigenvalues , @xmath99 , of the matrix @xmath100 , _ , ()=_-(_+ _ ) _  ( ) + _ , 0w()_0 ( ) , and the @xmath101 are determined by the corresponding right eigenvector .    in the remainder of the paper
, we shall investigate the nature of these instabilities by studying the eigenvalues and eigenvectors corresponding to the matrix @xmath102 as a function of @xmath6 .
we have analyzed the lowest eigenvalues , @xmath99 , as a function of @xmath6 for a variety of interaction and fl * parameters ( see figs .
[ lambq_j ] , [ lambq_jv ] ) .
these results should be contrasted with the eigenvalues obtained for instabilities of metals with a large fermi surface , interacting via short - ranged interactions , as shown in appendix [ fl ] and earlier works @xcite .
let us now start by exploring the nature of these instabilities in the presence of purely exchange interactions , @xmath19 set @xmath103 .
we plot @xmath99 as a function of @xmath6 in fig.[lambq_j ] for two different choice of fl * and exchange - interaction parameters , @xmath104 . for the fl * state shown in fig.[lambq_j](a ) , the charge - ordering eigenvalues are displayed in fig.[lambq_j](b ) .
note that the global - minimum at @xmath105 , which is a robust feature of an instability arising out of a large fs ( with @xmath106 ) , has disappeared ( see fig .
[ fllambq_j](a ) in appendix [ fl ] ; refs .
@xcite ) . instead , there are now ridges of instability that extend starting from wavevectors of the type @xmath107 and @xmath108 .
interestingly , the lowest eigenvalue is shifted slightly away from the axis and corresponds to @xmath109 .
however , the eigenvalue , @xmath110 , for the state on the axis with @xmath111 , is infinitesimally close to the lowest eigenvalue .. ] the charge - ordering eigenvectors for these states are given by , p_^*()=&-&0.996[k_x - k_y ] + 0.079 [ k_x+k_y ] + & + & 0.017 [ 2k_xk_y ] + & - & 0.027 [ 2k_x - 2k_y ] - 0.014 [ 2k_x + 2k_y ] , + p_^**()=&+&0.996[k_x - k_y ] - 0.084 [ k_x+k_y ] + & - & 0.017 [ 2k_xk_y ] + & + & 0.027 [ 2k_x - 2k_y ] + 0.014 [ 2k_x + 2k_y ] , both of which predominantly have a @xmath18wave component ( and a tiny @xmath112 component ) .    while the eigenvalue analysis does nt directly tell us how the wavevector of the leading instability relates to the underlying fermi surface geometry , it is reasonable to associate it with points in the brillouin - zone which have a high joint density of states .
it is then straightforward to see that @xmath113 connects the tips of the pockets ( shown as the b arrows in fig.[lambq_j]a ) .
there is also a secondary ridge of instability , which corresponds to a set of local but not global minima , extending from approximately @xmath114 to @xmath115 . upon close inspection
, we realize that such a ridge exists even for the large fermi surface computation ( fig.[fllambq_j]a ) , though the eigenvalues there were significantly larger than the one corresponding to the global minimum .
these bdw states contain an admixture of @xmath18 and @xmath112 form factors .
however , the states marked in yellow in the vicinity of @xmath116 and @xmath117 break time - reversal symmetry and correspond to states that have spontaneous currents .    we can repeat a similar analysis for other fl * and interaction parameters , as shown in fig.[lambq_j](c ) , ( d ) .
for the fl * state shown in fig.[lambq_j](c ) , the lowest eigenvalue corresponds to @xmath118 .
though the particular wavevector in this case corresponds to a period-4 cdw , this is entirely a coincidence ; @xmath119 happens to connect the tips of the pockets ( shown as black arrows in fig.[lambq_j]c ) .
the charge - ordering eigenvector for this state is given by , p_^*()=&+&0.993 [ k_x - k_y ] - 0.095 [ k_x+k_y ] + & - & 0.032 [ 2k_xk_y ] + & + & 0.050 [ 2k_x - 2k_y ] + 0.027 [ 2k_x + 2k_y ] , which , once again , predominantly has a @xmath18wave component .
the secondary ridge of instability appears here as well , extending from approximately @xmath120 to @xmath121 , and contains an admixture of @xmath18 and @xmath112 form factors .
the states marked in yellow in the vicinity of @xmath116 and @xmath117 continue to break time - reversal symmetry .
the results for both of these cases above are very similar , with one major qualitative difference . in the first case
, the region around @xmath122 has a local  valley ' of instability , where the state at @xmath122 corresponds to a nematic instability with a purely @xmath18form factor .
this is no longer true for the second case considered here .
let us now study the problem in the presence of coulomb repulsion  the results are displayed in fig.[lambq_jv ] .
interestingly , in this case for the particular choice of parameters , the leading instability in the particle - hole channel for the fl * state in fig.[lambq_jv](a ) corresponds to @xmath123 , @xmath124 .
the charge - ordering eigenvector for this state is given by , p_^*()=&- & 0.184 - 0.694[k_x - k_y ] - 0.694[k_x+k_y ] + & + & 0.021 [ 2k_xk_y ] + & - & 0.006 [ 2k_x - 2k_y ] - 0.033 [ 2k_x + 2k_y ] .
however , as can be seen from fig.[lambq_jv](b ) , there is a subleading instability to a bdw with @xmath125 , @xmath126 , whose eigenvalue , @xmath110 , is in fact very close to @xmath127 .
the corresponding eigenvector is given by , p_^**()=&- & 0.012 - 0.986[k_x - k_y ] + 0.162[k_x+k_y ] + & + & 0.024 [ 2k_xk_y ] + & - & 0.032 [ 2k_x - 2k_y ] - 0.012 [ 2k_x + 2k_y ] , which , not surprisingly , has a predominantly @xmath18form factor .
the remaining features in the @xmath128 phase diagram remain identical to the earlier results shown in fig.[lambq_j](b ) .
we investigate the nature of the instabilities for two more cases in appendix [ coulomb ] , when @xmath129 and @xmath130 .
the nature of the leading instabilities in these two cases is different ; in the first case it is a  staggered - flux ' state ( though away from @xmath131 ) that breaks time reversal symmetry , while in the second case it leads to a conventional charge - density wave at @xmath131 .
however , within the region of small @xmath132 of interest to us here , there remains a local instability to a @xmath1-form factor density wave with wavevectors of the form @xmath133 and @xmath134 , similar to those found above .
we have argued here that the incommensurate charge density wave state in the underdoped cuprates acts as a window into the exotic  normal ' phase out of which it emerges .
the traditional weak - coupling computations that start with a large fermi surface give rise to a density wave instability with diagonal wavevectors of the form @xmath2 , which is in disagreement with the experimental observations . a promising candidate for the normal state of the underdoped cuprates
is a u(1)-fl * , where the electrons are coupled to the fractionalized excitations of a quantum fluctuating antiferromagnet . in this paper , we have investigated the charge - ordering instabilities of such a fl * state , and have identified the leading instability of the fl * state in the particle - hole channel . in most of the cases considered here , this leads to a @xmath18form factor bond density wave with wavevectors of the form @xmath135 , where @xmath15 is related to a geometric property of the fermi surfaces of the fl * state .
moreover , as a function of increasing doping , as the size of the hole - pockets increase , the magnitude of the wavevector that nests the tips of the pockets decreases .
this agrees with the trend that has been seen in experiments , where the bdw wavector is a decreasing function of the increasing hole - doping @xcite .
while the identification of the correct bdw starting from a more exotic normal state is an interesting result , there are other implications at low temperatures of having a parent fl*. the vanilla fl * state has hole pockets with non - zero ( but small ) photoemission intensity on the ` back side ' _ i.e. _ outside the first antiferromagnetic brillouin zone , and the photoemission observations of ref .
have been argued to be consistent with this .
however , the superconducting state descending from such a fl * metal has 8 nodal points @xcite , and no signs of such a feature have been experimentally detected .
but , it should be noted that u(1)-fl * is ultimately unstable to confinement , because in the absence of fermions carrying the u(1 ) gauge charge , monopoles must proliferate at large enough scales .
it is expected that this crossover to confinement will resolve the experimental conflicts of the fl * state . moreover , with the presence of an incommensurate bdw , there are no issues with the conventional luttinger theorem , and so the crossover to confinement can happen without the need for further symmetry breaking .
finally , we note implications for experiments on the cuprates in high magnetic fields . in the light of the above results
, it would be interesting to investigate how the bdw derived from an fl * evolves as a function of magnetic field , and in particular , determine its relation to the observed quantum oscillations at intermediate and high fields @xcite .
computations starting from a large fermi surface in the presence of long - range charge order show a nodal electron - pocket @xcite and the more recently discovered hole - pockets @xcite ; it is not implausible that similar results will also be obtained starting from u(1)-fl * , especially after the crossover to confinement has been accounted for . moreover , in the fl * framework the full large fermi surface is never recovered , because even in the absence of charge order the spin liquid suppresses much of the fermi surface : this may be a way of reconciling with thermodynamic measurements of the specific - heat @xcite and the spin - susceptibility @xcite .

we plot the lowest eigenvalues , @xmath99 , for the charge - ordering instabilities of the large fs corresponding to parameters of figs.[lambq_j ] , [ lambq_jv ] in fig.[fllambq_j ] below .    for the parameters in fig.[fllambq_j](a ) ,
the minimum eigenvalue occurs at @xmath136 and the corresponding eigenvector is given by , p_^*=-0.999 [ k_x - k_y ] - 0.014 [ ( 2k_x)-(2k_y ) ] . for the parameters in figs.[fllambq_j](b ) , ( c ) , the minimum eigenvalue occurs at the same value of @xmath119 as above and the form of the eigenvector remains almost identical .
this is nt surprising , since @xmath119 is determined by the separation between the  hot - spots ' .
in this appendix , we present some additional results for the weak - coupling density - wave instabilities in the presence of strong coulomb repulsion ( @xmath137 ) .
the leading instabilities that we obtain are not bond - density waves of the type discussed in the main text .
we explore the instabilities for the fl * state whose spectral weight is shown in fig.[lambq_jv](a ) for different combinations of the coulomb repulsion parameters .
the lowest eigenvalues , @xmath99 as a function of @xmath6 are shown in fig.[coul ] .    we start with the case when @xmath129 ( fig.[coul]a ) .
we find that the leading instability corresponds to @xmath138 and the eigenvector for this state is predominantly given by @xmath139 .
this state therefore breaks time - reversal symmetry and is a generalized version of the  staggered - flux ' state , but at a wavevector away from @xmath131 .
we next consider the case when @xmath140 ( fig.[coul]b ) . in this case , we find that the leading instability occurs at @xmath141 and the eigenvector for this state is given by @xmath142 .
this state is therefore just a conventional @xmath131 charge - density wave , that we should naively expect to arise due a large @xmath143 .
however , we note that if we focus on the region of the brillouin zone with smaller @xmath132 , the @xmath1-form factor density waves found in the body of the paper with smaller coulomb repulsion are present also in the cases considered in this appendix .
thus the coulomb repulsion has little direct effect on the @xmath1-form factor density waves , but , in the present simple rpa framework , it can induce other instabilities which are not of current experimental interest ." ," recent experiments in the underdoped regime of the hole - doped cuprates have found evidence for an incommensurate charge density wave state . 
 we present an analysis of the charge ordering instabilities in a metal with antiferromagnetic correlations , where the electronic excitations are coupled to the fractionalized excitations of a quantum fluctuating antiferromagnet on the square lattice . 
 the resulting charge density wave state emerging out of such a fractionalized fermi - liquid ( fl * ) has wavevectors of the form @xmath0 , with a predominantly @xmath1-form factor , in agreement with experiments on a number of different families of the cuprates . in contrast , as previously shown , the charge density wave instability of a nearly antiferromagnetic metal with a large fermi surface , interacting via short - range interactions , has wavevectors of the type @xmath2 . 
 our results show that the observed charge density wave appears as a low - energy instability of a fractionalized metallic state linked to the proximity to an antiferromagnetic insulator , and the pseudogap regime can be described by such a metal at least over intermediate length and energy scales . "
"a geometry lies in the foundation of physics , and a true conception of geometry is very important for the consequent development of physics .
it is common practice to think that all problems in foundations of geometry have been solved many years ago .
it is valid , but this concerns the geometry considered to be a logical construction .
physicists are interested in the geometry considered as a science on mutual disposition of geometrical objects in the space or in the space - time .
the two aspects of geometry are quite different , and one can speak about two different geometries , using for them two different terms .
geometry as a logical construction is a homogeneous geometry , where all points have the same properties .
well known mathematician felix klein @xcite believed that only the homogeneous geometry deserves to be called a geometry .
it is his opinion that the riemannian geometry ( in general , inhomogeneous geometry ) should be qualified as a riemannian geography , or a riemannian topography . in other words
, felix klein considered a geometry mainly as a logical construction .
we shall refer to such a geometry as the mathematical geometry .
the geometry considered to be a science on mutual disposition of geometric objects will be referred to as a physical geometry , because the physicists are interested mainly in this aspect of a geometry .
the physical geometries are inhomogeneous , in general , although they may be homogeneous also . on the one hand ,
the proper euclidean geometry is a physical geometry . on the other hand ,
it is a logical construction , because it is homogeneous and can be constructed of simple elements ( points , straights , planes , etc . ) .
all elements of the euclidean geometry have similar properties , which are described by axioms .
similarity of geometrical elements allows one to construct the mathematical ( homogeneous ) geometry by means of logical reasonings .
the proper euclidean geometry was constructed many years ago by euclid .
consistency of this construction was investigated and proved in @xcite .
such a construction is very complicated even in the case of the proper euclidean geometry , because simple geometrical objects are used for construction of more complicated ones , and one can not construct a complicated geometrical object @xmath5 without construction of more simple constituents of this object .    note that constructing his geometry , euclid did not use coordinates for labeling of the space points .
his description of the homogeneous geometry was coordinateless .
it means that the coordinates are not a necessary attribute of the geometry .
coordinate system is a method of the geometry description , which may or may not be used .
application of coordinates and of other means of description poses the problem of separation of the geometry properties from the properties of the means of the description .
usually the separation of the geometry properties from the coordinate system properties is carried out as follows .
the geometry is described in all possible coordinate systems .
transformations from one coordinate system to the another one form a group of transformation .
invariants of this transformation group are the same in all coordinate system , and hence , they describe properties of the geometry in question .    at this point
we are to make a very important remark .
_ any geometry is a totality of all geometric objects _ @xmath5 _ _  and of all relations _ _ @xmath6 _ _  between them__. any geometric object @xmath5 is a subset of points of some point set @xmath7 , where the geometry is given . in the riemannian geometry ( and in other inhomogeneous geometries )
the set @xmath7 is supposed to be a @xmath8-dimensional manifold , whose points @xmath9 are labelled by @xmath8 coordinates @xmath10 .
this labelling ( arithmetization of space ) is considered to be a necessary attribute of the riemannian geometry .
most geometers believe that the riemannian geometry ( and physical geometry , in general ) can not be constructed without introduction of the manifold . in other words
, they believe that the manifold is an attribute of the riemannian geometry ( and of any continuous geometry , in general ) . this belief is founded on the fact , that the riemannian geometry is always constructed on some manifold .
but this belief is a delusion .
the fact , that we always construct the physical geometry on some manifold , does not mean that the physical geometry can not be constructed without a reference to a manifold , or to a coordinate system .
of course , some labelling of the spatial points ( coordinate system ) is convenient , but this labelling has no relations to the construction of the geometry , and the physical geometry should be constructed without a reference to coordinate system .
application of the coordinate system imposes constraints on properties of the constructed physical geometry .
for instance , if we use a continuous coordinate system ( manifold ) we can construct only continuous physical geometry . to construct a discrete physical geometry ,
the geometry construction is not to contain a reference to the coordinate system .    here
we present the method of the physical geometry construction , which does not contain a reference to the coordinate system and other means of description .
it contains a reference only to the distance function @xmath0 , which is a real characteristic of physical geometry .    if a geometry is inhomogeneous , and the straights located in different places have different properties , it is impossible to describe properties of straights by means of axioms , because there are no such axioms for the whole geometry .
mutual disposition of points in a physical ( inhomogeneous ) geometry , which is given on the set @xmath7 of points @xmath9 , is described by the distance function @xmath11@xmath12 the distance function @xmath0 is the main characteristic of the physical geometry .
besides , the distance function @xmath0 is an _ unique characteristic _ of any physical geometry . _ the distance function _ @xmath0 _ _  determines completely the physical geometry .
_ _ this statement is very important for construction of a physical geometry .
it will be proved below . any physical geometry @xmath3 is constructed from the proper euclidean geometry @xmath13 by means of a deformation , i.e. by a replacement of the euclidean distance function @xmath14 by the distance function of the geometry in question .
for instance , constructing the riemannian geometry , we replace the euclidean infinitesimal distance @xmath15 by the riemannian one @xmath16 .
there is no method of the inhomogeneous physical geometry construction other , than the deformation of the euclidean geometry ( or some other homogeneous geometry ) which is constructed as a mathematical geometry on the basis of its axiomatics and logic .
unfortunately , conventional method of the riemannian geometry construction contains a reference to the coordinate system . but this reference can be eliminated , provided that we use finite distances @xmath0 instead of infinitesimal distances @xmath17 .    for description of a physical geometry one uses the world function @xmath4 @xcite , which is connected with the distance function @xmath0 by means of the relation @xmath18 .
the world function @xmath4 of the @xmath4-space @xmath19 is defined by the relation @xmath20 application of the world function is more convenient in the relation that the world function is real , when the distance function @xmath0 is imaginary and does not satisfy definition ( [ b1.1 ] ) .
it is important at the consideration of the space - time geometry as a physical geometry .
in general , a physical geometry can not be constructed as a logical building , because any change of the world function should be accompanied by a change of axiomatics .
this is practically aerial , because the set of possible physical geometries is continual .
does the world function contain full information which is necessary for construction of the physical geometry ? it is a very important question .
for instance , can one derive the space dimension from the world function in the case of euclidean geometry ?
slightly below we shall answer this question in the affirmative .
now we formulate the method of the physical geometry construction .
let us imagine that the proper euclidean geometry @xmath13 can be described completely in terms and only in terms of the euclidean world function @xmath2 .
such a description is called @xmath4-immanent .
it means that any geometrical object @xmath21 and any relation @xmath22 between geometrical objects in @xmath13 can be described in terms of @xmath2 in the form @xmath23 and @xmath24 . to obtain corresponding geometrical object @xmath5 and corresponding relation @xmath6 between the geometrical objects in other physical geometry @xmath3 ,
it is sufficient to replace the euclidean world function @xmath2 by the world function @xmath4 of the physical geometry @xmath3 in description of @xmath25 and @xmath24 . @xmath26
index e shows that the geometric object is constructed on the basis of the euclidean axiomatics .
thus , one can obtain another physical geometry @xmath3 from the euclidean geometry @xmath13 by a simple replacement of @xmath2 by @xmath4 .
for such a construction one needs no axiomatics and no reasonings .
one needs no means of descriptions ( topological structures , continuity , coordinate system , manifold , dimension , etc . ) .
in fact , one uses implicitly the axiomatics of the euclidean geometry , which is deformed by the replacement @xmath27 .
this replacement may be interpreted as a deformation of the euclidean space .
absence of a reference to the means of description is an advantage of the considered method of the geometry construction .
besides , there is no necessity to construct the whole geometry @xmath3
. we can construct and investigate only that part of the geometry @xmath3 which we are interested in .
any physical geometry may be constructed as a result of a deformation of the euclidean geometry .
the geometric object @xmath5 is described by means of the skeleton - envelope method @xcite .
it means that any geometric object @xmath5 is considered to be a set of intersections and joins of elementary geometric objects ( ego ) .
the finite set @xmath28 of parameters of the envelope function @xmath29 is the skeleton of elementary geometric object ( ego ) @xmath30 .
the set @xmath31 of points forming ego is called the envelope of its skeleton @xmath32 . for continuous physical geometry
the envelope @xmath33 is usually a continual set of points .
the envelope function @xmath29 , determining ego is a function of the running point @xmath34 and of parameters @xmath35 .
the envelope function @xmath29 is supposed to be an algebraic function of @xmath36 arguments @xmath37 , @xmath38 .
each of arguments @xmath39 is a @xmath4-function of two arguments @xmath40 , either belonging to skeleton @xmath32 , or coinciding with the running point @xmath41 .
thus , any elementary geometric object @xmath33 is determined by its skeleton and its envelope function .
for instance , the sphere @xmath42 with the center at the point @xmath43 is determined by the relation @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a point belonging to the sphere .
the elementary object @xmath33 is determined in all physical geometries at once .
in particular , it is determined in the proper euclidean geometry , where we can obtain its meaning .
we interpret the elementary geometrical object @xmath33 , using our knowledge of the proper euclidean geometry .
thus , the proper euclidean geometry is used as a sample geometry for interpretation of any physical geometry .
we do not try to repeat subscriptions of euclid at construction of the geometry .
we take the geometrical objects and relations between them , prepared in the framework of the euclidean geometry and describe them in terms of the world function .
thereafter we deform them , replacing the euclidean world function @xmath2 by the world function @xmath4 of the geometry in question . in practice the construction of the elementary geometry object
is reduced to the representation of the corresponding euclidean geometrical object in the @xmath4-immanent form , i.e. in terms of the euclidean world function .
the last problem is the problem of the proper euclidean geometry .
the problem of representation of the geometrical object ( or relation between objects ) in the @xmath4-immanent form is a real problem of the physical geometry construction .
it is very important , that such a construction does not use coordinates and other methods of description , because the application of the means of description imposes constraints on the constructed geometry .
any means of description is a structure @xmath46 given on the basic euclidean geometry with the world function @xmath2 .
replacement @xmath27 is sufficient for construction of unique physical geometry @xmath47 .
if we use an additional structure @xmath46 for construction of physical geometry , we obtain , in general , other geometry @xmath48 , which coincide with @xmath47 not for all @xmath4 , but only for some of world functions @xmath4 .
thus , a use of additional means of description restricts the list of possible physical geometries .
for instance , if we use the coordinate description at construction of the physical geometry , the obtained geometry appears to be continuous , because description by means of the coordinates is effective only for continuous geometries , where the number of coordinates coincides with the geometry dimension .    constructing geometry @xmath3 by vtans of a deformation we use essentially the fact that the proper euclidean geometry @xmath13 is a mathematical geometry , which has been constucted on the basis of euclidean axiomatics and logical reasonings .
we shall refer to the described method of the physical geometry construction as the deformation principle and interpret the deformation in the broad sense of the word .
in particular , a deformation of the euclidean space may transform an euclidean surface into a point , and an euclidean point into a surface .
such a deformation may remove some points of the euclidean space , violating its continuity , or decreasing its dimension .
such a deformation may add supplemental points to the euclidean space , increasing its dimension .
in other words , the deformation principle is a very general method of the physical geometry construction .
the deformation principle as a method of the physical geometry construction contains two essential stages :    \(i ) representation of geometrical objects @xmath5 and relations @xmath6 of the euclidean geometry in the @xmath4-immanent form , i.e. in terms and only in terms of the world function @xmath2 .
\(ii ) replacement of the euclidean world function @xmath2 by the world function @xmath4 of the geometry in question .    a physical geometry , constructed by means of the only deformation principle ( i.e. without a use of other methods of the geometry construction ) is called t - geometry ( tubular geometry ) @xcite .
the t - geometry is the most general kind of the physical geometry .
application of the deformation principle is restricted by two constraints .
\1 . describing euclidean geometric objects @xmath49 and euclidean relation @xmath50 in terms of @xmath2 , we are not to use special properties of euclidean world function @xmath2 . in particular , definitions of @xmath49 and @xmath50 are to have similar form in euclidean geometries of different dimensions .
they must not depend on the dimension of the euclidean space .
the deformation principle is to be applied separately from other methods of the geometry construction . in particular
, one may not use topological structures in construction of a physical geometry , because for effective application of the deformation principle the obtained physical geometry must be determined only by the world function ( metric ) .
the crucial point of the t - geometry construction is the description of the proper euclidean geometry in terms of the euclidean world function @xmath2
. we shall refer to this method of description as the @xmath4-immanent description .
unfortunately , it was unknown for many years , although all physicists knew that the infinitesimal interval @xmath16 is the unique essential characteristic of the space - time geometry , and changing this expression , we change the space - time geometry . from physical viewpoint
the @xmath4-immanent description is very reasonable , because it does not contain any extrinsic information .
the @xmath4-immanent description does not refer to the means of description ( dimension , manifold , coordinate system ) .
absence of references to means of description is important in the relation , that there is no necessity to separate the information on the geometry in itself from the information on the means of description .
the @xmath4-immanent description contains only essential characteristic of geometry : its world function . at first
the @xmath4-immanent description was obtained in 1990 @xcite .
the first question concerning the @xmath4-immanent description is as follows .
does the world function contain sufficient information for description of a physical geometry ?
the answer is affirmative , at least , in the case of the proper euclidean geometry , and this answer is given by the prove of the following theorem .
let @xmath4-space @xmath51 be a set @xmath7 of points @xmath9 with the given world function @xmath4@xmath52 let the vector @xmath53 be the ordered set of two points @xmath43 , @xmath45 , and its length @xmath54 is defined by the relation @xmath55 .
_ theorem _    the @xmath4-space @xmath51 is the @xmath8-dimensional proper euclidean space , if and only if the world function @xmath4 satisfies the following conditions , written in terms of the world function @xmath4 .    i. condition of symmetry : @xmath56    \ii . definition of the dimension : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the gram s determinant @xmath59 the scalar product @xmath60 of two vectors @xmath61 and @xmath62 is defined by the relation @xmath63 vectors @xmath64 , @xmath65 are basic vectors of the rectilinear coordinate system @xmath66 with the origin at the point @xmath67 , and the metric tensors @xmath68 , @xmath69 ,  @xmath70 in @xmath66 are defined by the relations @xmath71
linear structure of the euclidean space : @xmath72 where coordinates @xmath73 @xmath74 of the point @xmath9 are covariant coordinates of the vector @xmath75 , defined by the relation @xmath76    iv : the metric tensor matrix @xmath77 has only positive eigenvalues @xmath78    v. the continuity condition : the system of equations @xmath79 considered to be equations for determination of the point @xmath9 as a function of coordinates @xmath80 ,  @xmath74 has always one and only one solution . conditions ii 
v contain a reference to the dimension @xmath8 of the euclidean space .
as far as the @xmath4-immanent description of the proper euclidean geometry is possible , it is possible for any t - geometry , because any geometrical object @xmath5 and any relation @xmath6 in the physical geometry @xmath3 is obtained from the corresponding geometrical object @xmath21 and from the corresponding relation @xmath22 in the proper euclidean geometry @xmath13 by means of the replacement @xmath27 in description of @xmath21 an @xmath22 .
for such a replacement be possible , the description of @xmath21 and @xmath22 is not to refer to special properties of @xmath2 , described by conditions ii  v. a formal indicator of the conditions ii  v application is a reference to the dimension @xmath8 , because any of conditions ii  v contains a reference to the dimension @xmath8 of the proper euclidean space .
if nevertheless we use one of special properties ii  v of the euclidean space in the @xmath4-immanent description of a geometrical object @xmath5 , or relation @xmath6 , we refer to the dimension @xmath8 and , ultimately , to the coordinate system , which is only a means of description .
let us show this in the example of the determination of the straight in the @xmath8-dimensional euclidean space .
the straight @xmath81 in the proper euclidean space is defined by two its points @xmath43 and @xmath82 @xmath83 as the set of points @xmath41 @xmath84 where condition @xmath85 means that vectors @xmath86 and @xmath87 are collinear , i.e. the scalar product @xmath88 of these two vectors satisfies the relation @xmath89 where the scalar product is defined by the relation ( [ b11a ] ) .
thus , the straight line @xmath81 is defined @xmath4-immanently , i.e. in terms of the world function @xmath4 .
we shall use two different names ( straight and tube ) for the geometric object @xmath81 .
we shall use the term  straight  , when we want to stress that @xmath81 is a result of deformation of the euclidean straight .
we shall use the term  tube  , when we want to stress that @xmath81 may be a many - dimensional surface .    in the euclidean geometry one can use another definition of collinearity .
vectors @xmath86 and @xmath87 are collinear , if components of vectors @xmath86 and @xmath87 in some coordinate system are proportional .
for instance , in the @xmath8-dimensional euclidean space one can introduce rectangular coordinate system , choosing @xmath90 points @xmath91 and forming @xmath8 basic vectors @xmath64 , @xmath74 .
then the collinearity condition can be written in the form of @xmath8 equations @xmath92 where @xmath93 is some constant
. relations ( [ b17 ] ) are relations for covariant components of vectors @xmath86 and @xmath87 in the considered coordinate system with basic vectors @xmath64 , @xmath74 .
let points @xmath32 be chosen in such a way , that @xmath94 . then eliminating the parameter @xmath93 from relations ( [ b17 ] )
, we obtain @xmath95 independent relations , and the geometrical object @xmath96 defined according to ( [ b17 ] ) , depends on @xmath97 points @xmath98 . this geometrical object @xmath99
is defined @xmath4-immanently .
it is a complex , consisting of the straight line and the coordinate system , represented by @xmath90 points @xmath91 . in the euclidean space
the dependence on the choice of the coordinate system and on @xmath90 points @xmath32 determining this system , is fictitious .
the geometrical object @xmath99 depends only on two points @xmath100 and coincides with the straight line @xmath81 .
but at deformations of the euclidean space the geometrical objects @xmath99 and @xmath81 are deformed differently .
the points @xmath101 cease to be fictitious in definition of @xmath99 , and geometrical objects @xmath99 and @xmath81 become to be different geometric objects , in general . but being different , in general , they may coincide in some special cases .    what of the two geometrical objects in the deformed geometry should be interpreted as the straight line , passing through the points @xmath43 and @xmath82 in the geometry @xmath3 ?
of course , it is @xmath81 , because its definition does not contain a reference to a coordinate system , whereas definition of @xmath99 depends on the choice of the coordinate system , represented by points @xmath32 . in general ,
definitions of geometric objects and relations between them are not to refer to the means of description .
but in the given case the geometrical object @xmath81 is , in general , @xmath102-dimensional surface , whereas @xmath103 is an intersection of @xmath104 @xmath102-dimensional surfaces , i.e. @xmath99 is , in general , a one - dimensional curve .
the one - dimensional curve @xmath99 corresponds better to our ideas on the straight line , than the @xmath102-dimensional surface @xmath81 .
nevertheless , in physical geometry @xmath3 it is @xmath81 , that is an analog of the euclidean straight line .
it is very difficult to overcome our conventional idea that the euclidean straight line can not be deformed into many - dimensional surface , and _ this idea has been prevent for years from construction of t - geometries_. practically one uses such physical geometries , where deformation of the euclidean space transforms the euclidean straight lines into one - dimensional lines .
it means that one chooses such geometries , where geometrical objects @xmath81 and @xmath99 coincide .
@xmath105 condition ( [ b19 ] ) of coincidence of the objects @xmath81 and @xmath99 , imposed on the t - geometry , restricts list of possible t - geometries .
let us consider the metric geometry , given on the set @xmath7 of points .
the metric space @xmath106 is given by the metric ( distance ) @xmath107 .
@xmath108 at first sight the metric space is a special case of the @xmath4-space ( [ a1.3 ] ) , and the metric geometry is a special case of the t - geometry with additional constraints ( [ c2.5 ] ) , ( [ c2.6 ] ) imposed on the world function @xmath109 .
however it is not so , because the metric geometry does not use the deformation principle .
the fact , that the euclidean geometry can be described @xmath4-immanently , as well as the conditions ( [ b10 ] ) - ( [ b14 ] ) , were not known until 1990 .
additional ( with respect to the @xmath4-space ) constraints ( [ c2.5 ] ) , ( [ c2.6 ] ) are imposed to eliminate the situation , when the straight line is not a one - dimensional line .
the fact is that , in the metric geometry the shortest ( straight ) line can be constructed only in the case , when it is one - dimensional .
let us consider the set @xmath110 of points @xmath41 @xmath111 if the metric space coincides with the proper euclidean space , this set of points is an ellipsoid with focuses at the points @xmath112 and the large semiaxis @xmath93 .
the relations @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 determine respectively external points , boundary points and internal points of the ellipsoid . if @xmath116 , we obtain the degenerate ellipsoid , which coincides with the segment @xmath117 } $ ] of the straight line , passing through the points @xmath9 , @xmath82 .  in the proper euclidean geometry ,
the degenerate ellipsoid is one - dimensional segment of the straight line , but it is not evident that it is one - dimensional in the case of arbitrary metric geometry .
for such a degenerate ellipsoid be one - dimensional in the arbitrary metric space , it is necessary that any degenerate ellipsoid @xmath118 have no internal points .
this constraint is written in the form @xmath119    comparing relation ( [ c2.9 ] ) with ( [ c2.6 ] ) , we see that the constraint ( [ c2.6 ] ) is introduced to make the straight ( shortest ) line to be one - dimensional ( absence of internal points in the geometrical object determined by two points ) .    as far as the metric geometry does not use the deformation principle , it is a poor geometry , because in the framework of this geometry one can not construct the scalar product of two vectors , define linear independence of vectors and construct such geometrical objects as planes .
all these objects as well as other are constructed on the basis of the deformation of the proper euclidean geometry .
generalizing the metric geometry , menger @xcite and blumenthal @xcite removed the triangle axiom ( [ c2.6 ] ) .
they tried to construct the distance geometry , which would be a more general geometry , than the metric one . as far as they did not use the deformation principle
, they could not determine the shortest ( straight ) line without a reference to the topological concept of the curve @xmath120 , defined as a continuous mapping @xmath121 \rightarrow \omega   \label{a1.1}\ ] ] which can not be expressed only via the distance . as a result the distance geometry appeared to be not a pure metric geometry , what the t - geometry is .
riemannian geometries satisfy the condition ( [ b19 ] ) .
the riemannian geometry is a kind of inhomogeneous physical geometry , and , hence , it uses the deformation principle . constructing the riemannian geometry ,
the infinitesimal euclidean distance is deformed into the riemannian distance .
the deformation is chosen in such a way that any euclidean straight line @xmath122 , passing through the point @xmath43 , collinear to the vector @xmath86 , transforms into the geodesic @xmath81 , passing through the point @xmath43 , collinear to the vector @xmath86 in the riemannian space .    note that in t - geometries , satisfying the condition ( [ b19 ] ) for all points @xmath98 , the straight line @xmath123 passing through the point @xmath124 collinear to the vector @xmath86 , is not a one - dimensional line , in general . if the riemannian geometries be t - geometries , they would contain non - one - dimensional geodesics ( straight lines ) .
but the riemannian geometries are not t - geometries , because at their construction one uses not only the deformation principle , but some other methods , containing a reference to the means of description . in particular , in the riemannian geometries the absolute parallelism is absent , and one can not to define a straight line ( [ b3.0 ] ) , because the relation @xmath125 is not defined , if points @xmath43 and @xmath124 do not coincide .
on one hand , a lack of absolute parallelism allows one to go around the problem of non - one - dimensional straight lines . on the other hand
, it makes the riemannian geometries to be inconsistent , because they cease to be t - geometries , which are consistent by the construction ( see for details @xcite ) .
the fact is that the application of _ only deformation principle _ is sufficient for construction of a physical geometry .
besides , such a construction is consistent , because the original euclidean geometry is consistent and , deforming it , we do not use any reasonings .
if we introduce additional structure ( for instance , a topological structure ) we obtain a fortified physical geometry , i.e. a physical geometry with additional structure on it . the physical geometry with additional structure on it is a more pithy construction , than the physical geometry simply .
but it is valid only in the case , when we consider the additional structure as an addition to the physical geometry .
if we use an additional structure in construction of the geometry , we identify the additional structure with one of structures of the physical geometry .
if we demand that the additional structure to be a structure of physical geometry , we restrict an application of the deformation principle and reduce the list of possible physical geometries , because coincidence of the additional structure with some structure of a physical geometry is possible not for all physical geometries , but only for some of them .
let , for instance , we use concept of a curve @xmath120 ( [ a1.1 ] ) for construction of a physical geometry . the concept of curve @xmath120 , considered as a continuous mapping is a topological structure , which can not be expressed only via the distance or via the world function .
a use of the mapping ( [ a1.1 ] ) needs an introduction of topological space and , in particular , the concept of continuity .
if we identify the topological curve ( [ a1.1 ] ) with the  metrical  curve , defined as a broken line @xmath126 } , \qquad \mathcal{t}_{\left [ p_{i}p_{i+1}\right ] } = \left\ { r|\sqrt{2\sigma \left ( p_{i},p_{i+1}\right ) } -\sqrt{2\sigma \left ( p_{i},r\right ) } -\sqrt{2\sigma \left ( r , p_{i+1}\right ) } \right\ }   \label{a1.2}\ ] ] consisting of the straight line segments @xmath127 } $ ] between the points @xmath128 , @xmath129 , we truncate the list of possible geometries , because such an identification is possible only in some physical geometries . identifying ( [ a1.1 ] ) and ( [ a1.2 ] ) , we eliminate all discrete physical geometries and those continuous physical geometries , where the segment @xmath127 } $ ] of straight line is a surface , but not a one - dimensional set of points .
thus , additional structures may lead to ( i ) a fortified physical geometry , ( ii ) a restricted physical geometry and ( iii ) a restricted fortified physical geometry .
the result depends on the method of the additional structure application .
note that some constraints ( continuity , convexity , lack of absolute parallelism ) , imposed on physical geometries are a result of a disagreement of the applied means of the geometry construction .
in the t - geometry , which uses only the deformation principle , there is no such restrictions .
besides , the t - geometry accepts some new property of a physical geometry , which is not accepted by conventional versions of physical geometry .
this property , called the geometry nondegeneracy , follows directly from the application of arbitrary deformations to the proper euclidean geometry .
the geometry is degenerate at the point @xmath43 in the direction of the vector @xmath130 , @xmath131 , if the relations @xmath132 considered as equations for determination of the point @xmath41 , have not more , than one solution for any @xmath133 .
otherwise , the geometry is nondegenerate at the point @xmath43 in the direction of the vector @xmath130 .
note that the first equation ( [ b3.1 ] ) is the condition of the parallelism of vectors @xmath130 and @xmath87 .
the proper euclidean geometry is degenerate , i.e. it is degenerate at all points in directions of all vectors . considering the minkowski geometry
, one should distinguish between the minkowski t - geometry and minkowski geometry .
the two geometries are described by the same world function and differ in the definition of the parallelism . in the minkowski t - geometry the parallelism of two vectors @xmath134 and @xmath135 is defined by the first equation ( [ b3.1 ] ) .
this definition is based on the deformation principle . in minkowski geometry
the parallelism is defined by the relation of the type of ( [ b17 ] ) @xmath136 where points @xmath137 determine a rectilinear coordinate system with basic vectors @xmath64 , @xmath138 in the @xmath8-dimensional minkowski geometry ( @xmath8-dimensional pseudo - euclidean geometry of index @xmath139 ) .
dependence of the definition ( [ b3.1a ] ) on the points @xmath140 is fictitious , but dependence on the number @xmath90 of points @xmath32 is essential .
thus , definition ( [ b3.1a ] ) depends on the method of the geometry description .
the minkowski t - geometry is degenerate at all points in direction of all timelike vectors , and it is nondegenerate at all points in direction of all spacelike vectors .
the minkowski geometry is degenerate at all points in direction of all vectors .
conventionally one uses the minkowski geometry , ignoring the nondegeneracy in spacelike directions .    considering the proper riemannian geometry , one should distinguish between the riemannian t - geometry and the riemannian geometry .
the two geometries are described by the same world function .
they differ in the definition of the parallelism . in the riemannian t - geometry
the parallelism of two vectors @xmath134 and @xmath135 is defined by the first equation ( [ b3.1 ] ) . in the riemannian geometry
the parallelism of two vectors @xmath134 and @xmath135 is defined only in the case , when the points @xmath43 and @xmath124 coincide .
parallelism of remote vectors @xmath134 and @xmath135 is not defined , in general .
this fact is known as absence of absolute parallelism .
the proper riemannian t - geometry is locally degenerate , i.e. it is degenerate at all points @xmath43 in direction of vectors @xmath86 . in the general case ,
when @xmath141 , the proper riemannian t - geometry is nondegenerate , in general .
the proper riemannian geometry is degenerate , because it is degenerate locally , whereas the nonlocal degeneracy is not defined in the riemannian geometry , because of the lack of absolute parallelism .
conventionally one uses the riemannian geometry ( not rienannian t - geometry ) and ignores the property of the nondegenracy completely .    from the viewpoint of the conventional approach to the physical geometry the nondegeneracy is an undesirable property of a physical geometry , although from the logical viewpoint and from viewpoint of the deformation principle the nondegenracy is an inherent property of a physical geometry .
the nonlocal nondegeneracy is ejected from the proper riemannian geometry by denial of existence of the remote vector parallelism .
nondegeneracy in the spacelike directions is ejected from the minkowski geometry by means of the redefinition of the two vectors parallelism .
but the nondegeneracy is an important property of the real space - time geometry . to appreciate this ,
let us consider an example .
the t - geometry @xcite is defined on the @xmath4-space @xmath142 , where @xmath7 is an arbitrary set of points and the world function @xmath4 is defined by the relations      geometrical objects ( vector @xmath144 , scalar product of vectors @xmath145 , collinearity of vectors @xmath146 , segment of straight line @xmath147 } $ ] , etc . )
are defined on the @xmath4-space in the same way , as they are defined @xmath4-immanently in the proper euclidean space .
practically one uses the deformation principle , although it is not mentioned in all definitions .    let us consider a simple example of the space - time geometry @xmath148 , described by the t - geometry on 4-dimensional manifold @xmath149 . the world function @xmath150 is described by the relation @xmath151 where @xmath152 and @xmath153 are some constants .
the quantity @xmath154 is the world function in the minkowski space - time geometry @xmath155 . in the orthogonal rectilinear ( inertial )
coordinate system @xmath156 the world function @xmath154 has the form @xmath157 where @xmath158 is the speed of the light .
let us compare the broken line ( [ a1.2 ] ) in minkowski space - time geometry @xmath155 and in the distorted geometry @xmath148 .
we suppose that @xmath159 is timelike broken line , and all links @xmath127 } $ ] of @xmath159 are timelike and have the same length @xmath160 @xmath161 where indices  d  and  m  mean that the quantity is calculated by means of @xmath150 and @xmath162 respectively .
vector @xmath163 is regarded as the momentum of the particle at the segment @xmath127 } $ ] , and the quantity @xmath164 is interpreted as its ( geometric ) mass .
it follows from definition ( [ b11a ] ) and relation ( [ b3.3 ] ) , that for timelike vectors @xmath163 with @xmath165@xmath166 @xmath167 calculation of the shape of the segment @xmath147 } \left ( \sigma _ { \mathrm{d}}\right ) $ ] in @xmath148 gives the relation @xmath168 , & 1-\frac{\sqrt{2(\sigma _ { 0}+d)}}{\mu _ { \mathrm{d}}}<\tau < 1 \end{array } \right . ,   \label{b3.7a}\ ] ] where @xmath169 is the spatial radius of the segment @xmath147 } \left ( \sigma _ { \mathrm{d}}\right ) $ ] in the coordinate system , where points @xmath43 and @xmath45 have coordinates @xmath170 , @xmath171 and @xmath172 is a parameter along the segment @xmath147 } \left ( \sigma _ { \mathrm{d}}\right ) $ ] ( @xmath173 , @xmath174 ) .
one can see from ( [ b3.7a ] ) that the characteristic value of the segment radius is @xmath175 .
let the broken tube @xmath159 describe the  world line  of a free particle .
it means by definition that any link @xmath176 is parallel to the adjacent link @xmath163@xmath177 definition of parallelism is different in geometries @xmath155 and @xmath148 . as a result links , which are parallel in the geometry @xmath155 , are not parallel in @xmath148 and vice versa .
let @xmath178 describe the world line of a free particle in the geometry @xmath155 .
the angle @xmath179 between the adjacent links in @xmath155 is defined by the relation @xmath180 the angle @xmath181 , and the geometrical object @xmath178 is a timelike straight line on the manifold @xmath149 .
let now @xmath182 describe the world line of a free particle in the geometry @xmath148 .
the angle @xmath183 between the adjacent links in @xmath148 is defined by the relation @xmath184 the angle @xmath185 also . if we draw the broken tube @xmath182 on the manifold @xmath149 , using coordinates of basic points @xmath128 and measure the angle @xmath186 between the adjacent links in the minkowski geometry @xmath155 , we obtain for the angle @xmath186 the following relation @xmath187 substituting the value of @xmath188 , taken from ( [ b3.10 ] ) , we obtain @xmath189 hence , @xmath190 .
it means , that the adjacent link is located on the cone of angle @xmath191 , and the whole line @xmath182 has a random shape , because any link wabbles with the characteristic angle @xmath192 .
the wabble angle depends on the space - time distortion @xmath0 and on the particle mass @xmath193 .
the wabble angle is small for the large mass of a particle .
the random displacement of the segment end is of the order @xmath194 , i.e. of the same order as the segment width .
it is reasonable , because these two phenomena have the common source : the space - time distortion @xmath195 .
one should note that the space - time geometry influences the stochasticity of particle motion nonlocally in the sense , that the form of the world function ( [ b3.3 ] ) for values of @xmath196 is unessential for the motion stochasticity of the particle of the mass @xmath193 .
such a situation , when the world line of a free particle is stochastic in the deterministic geometry , and this stochasticity depends on the particle mass , seems to be rather exotic and incredible . but experiments show that the motion of real particles of small mass is stochastic indeed , and this stochasticity increases , when the particle mass decreases . from physical viewpoint a theoretical foundation of the stochasticity is desirable , and some researchers invent stochastic geometries , noncommutative geometries and other exotic geometrical constructions , to obtain the quantum stochasticity . but in the riemannian space - time geometry the particle motion does not depend on the particle mass , and in the framework of the riemannian space - time geometry it is difficult to explain the quantum stochasticity by the space - time geometry properties .
distorted geometry @xmath148 explains the stochasticity and its dependence on the particle mass freely . besides , at proper choice of the distortion @xmath0 the statistical description of stochastic
@xmath159 leads to the quantum description ( schrdinger equation ) @xcite .
it is sufficient to set @xmath197 , where @xmath198 is the quantum constant , @xmath158 is the speed of the light , and @xmath199 is some universal constant , connecting the geometrical mass @xmath200 with the usual particle mass @xmath201 by means of the relation @xmath202 . in other words , the distorted space - time geometry ( [ b3.3 ] ) is closer to the real space - time geometry , than the minkowski geometry @xmath155 .
further development of the statistical description of geometrical stochasticity leads to a creation of the model conception of quantum phenomena ( mcqp ) , which relates to the conventional quantum theory approximately in the same way as the statistical physics relates to the axiomatic thermodynamics .
mcqp is the well defined relativistic conception with effective methods of investigation @xcite , whereas the conventional quantum theory is not well defined , because it uses incorrect space - time geometry , whose incorrectness is compensated by additional hypotheses ( quantum principles ) . besides , it has problems with application of the nonrelativistic quantum mechanical technique to the description of relativistic phenomena .
the geometry @xmath148 is a homogeneous geometry as well as the minkowski geometry , because the world function @xmath150 is invariant with respect to all coordinate transformations , with respect to which the world function @xmath162 is invariant . in this connection
the question arises , whether one could invent some axiomatics for @xmath148 and derive the geometry @xmath148 from this axiomatics by means of proper reasonings .
note that such an axiomatics is to depend on the parameter @xmath0 , because the world function @xmath150 depends on this parameter . if @xmath203 , this axiomatics is to coincide with the axiomatics of the minkowski geometry @xmath155 .
if @xmath204 , this axiomatics can not coincide with the axiomatics of @xmath155 , because some axioms of @xmath155 are not satisfied in this case .
in general , the invention of axiomatics , depending on the parameter @xmath0 and in the general case on the distortion function @xmath195 , seems to be a very difficult problem . besides
, why invent the axiomatics ?
we had derived the axiomatics for the proper euclidean geometry , when we constructed it before .
there is no necessity to repeat this process any time , when we construct a new geometry .
it is sufficient to apply the deformation principle to the constructed euclidean geometry written @xmath4-immanently .
application of the deformation principle to the euclidean geometry is a very simple and very general procedue , which is not restricted by continuity , convexity and other artificial constraints , generated by our preconceived approach to the physical geometry .
( bias of the approach is displayed in the antecedent supposition on the one - dimensionality of any straight line in any physical geometry ) .
thus , we have seen that the nondegeneracy of the physical geometry as well as non - one - dimensionality of the straight line are properties of the real physical geometries .
the proper euclidean geometry is a ground for all physical geometries , and it is a degenerate geometry .
nevertheless , it is beyond reason to deny an existence of nondegenerate physical geometries .      1
.   the deformation principle uses results obtained at construction of the proper euclidean geometry and does not add any additional supposition on properties of geometrical objects . 2 .
the deformation principle uses only the real characteristic of the physical geometry 
its world function and does not use any additional means of description .
the deformation principle is very simple and allows one to investigate only that part of geometry which one is interested in .
application of the deformation principle allows one to obtain the true space - time geometry , whose unexpected properties can not be obtained at the conventional approach to physical geometry ." ," physical geometry studies mutual disposition of geometrical objects and points in space , or space - time , which is described by the distance function @xmath0 , or by the world function @xmath1 . 
 one suggests a new general method of the physical geometry construction . 
 the proper euclidean geometry is described in terms of its world function @xmath2 . any physical geometry @xmath3 is obtained from the euclidean geometry as a result of replacement of the euclidean world function @xmath2 by the world function @xmath4 of @xmath3 . 
 this method is very simple and effective . 
 it introduces a new geometric property : nondegeneracy of geometry . using this method 
 , one can construct deterministic space - time geometries with primordially stochastic motion of free particles and geometrized particle mass . 
 such a space - time geometry defined properly ( with quantum constant as an attribute of geometry ) allows one to explain quantum effects as a result of the statistical description of the stochastic particle motion ( without a use of quantum principles ) . "
