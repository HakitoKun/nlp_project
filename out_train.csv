"let us consider a @xmath0-layer multiplex network of @xmath1 nodes , i.e. a multi - layer graph in which each node can interact with the other ones by means of @xmath0 different kinds of relationships .
a multiplex is fully described by the @xmath0-dimensional array of the adjacency matrices of its layers @xmath2 } } , a{^{[2 ] } } , \ldots , a{^{[m]}}\}$ ] , where @xmath3}}=\{a{^{[\alpha]}}_{ij}\}\in\mathbb{r}^{n\times n}$ ] and @xmath4}}_{ij}=1 $ ] if node @xmath5 and node @xmath6 are connected at layer @xmath7 . in the following we assume the layers to be unweighted , but all the results can be easily extended to to the case of weighted multiplexes .    in general , a random walker on a multiplex is not constrained on a single layer and can exploit all the connections pointing out of the current node , at all layers . a synthetic yet incomplete description of the topology of a multiplex is provided by the overlapping adjacency matrix @xmath8 , whose entries @xmath9}$ ] account for the total number of connections between two nodes across all layers  @xcite .
in particular , we consider the class of markovian random walks defined by the transition probabilities : @xmath10 this set up is very general and allows for a variety of different motion rules .
in fact , @xmath11 can be either a function of some topological multiplex properties of the arrival node @xmath6 , or an informative combination of some structural features of the destination node , measured at all or at a fraction of the layers .
notice that the unbiased random walk on the multiplex is obtained by setting @xmath12 . in this case
a walker jumps out of node @xmath5 by traversing one of the edges incident on @xmath5 chosen with uniform probability and independently on the layer to which it belongs .
it is worth noting that the use of the overlapping adjacency matrix @xmath13 does not automatically make the walk in eq .
( [ eq : walk ] ) equivalent to a random walk on the aggregated graph obtained by flattening all the layers in a single network . in general , if the biasing function @xmath14 depends , either explicitly or implicitly , on the structural properties of node @xmath6 in the multiplex network , the walk in eq .
( [ eq : walk ] ) can not be directly mapped on an equivalent walk on the aggregated graph .    _ stationary probability distribution .  _ starting from the one - step transition probability given in eq .
[ eq : walk ] we derive closed forms for several asymptotic properties of the walk . following an approach similar to that used in ref .
@xcite , we now show that for any choice of the biasing function @xmath11 the stationary probability distribution @xmath15 of biased walks on multiplex networks can be analytically derived , under the hypotheses that _
i ) _ the topological overlapping matrix @xmath16 is primitive and that _ ii ) _ @xmath11 is a time - invariant function of any property of the destination node @xmath6 .
we start by considering the probability @xmath17 that a walker starting at node @xmath5 will be found on node @xmath6 after exactly @xmath18 time steps : @xmath19 and the dual probability @xmath20 : @xmath21 comparing eq .
( [ eq : pij ] ) with eq .
( [ eq : pji ] ) and considering that the multiplex is undirected ( i.e. , @xmath22 ) , we obtain @xmath23 where @xmath24 .
if the matrix @xmath25 is primitive , then a stationary probability distribution exists and @xmath26 , leading to the expression : @xmath27 by imposing the normalisation condition @xmath28 we finally get : @xmath29 we notice that eq .
( [ eq : stationary ] ) is quite general , since it does not explicitly depend on the form of the biasing function or on the actual structure of each layer or of the topological overlapping matrix @xmath25 .    in many real - world application scenarios , e.g. in crawling the structure of online social networks ,
it is important to guarantee that for long enough times the walk will end up visiting all the nodes of the graph with the same probability .
it is easy to prove that an unbiased random walk is not a good choice in this case , since its steady - state occupation probability distribution is proportional to the degree sequence , hence an appropriate bias should be used to avoid to visit hubs more frequently than poorly - connected nodes . in practice , it is not always possible to find a walk which produces exactly the same stationary occupation probability distribution for all the nodes , i.e. @xmath30 .
however , one could instead require that the resulting stationary probability distribution , although not equal for all nodes , has the minimum possible variance .
in particular , in the following we will focus on the normalised standard deviation of the stationary probability distribution : @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the average and the standard deviation of @xmath34 , respectively .
we will look for suitable combinations of the parameters of the walk that produce the smallest possible value of @xmath35 , corresponding to the maximum uniformity of the accessibility of the nodes attainable on a certain multiplex network .
_ entropy rate .
 _ one classical measure to quantify the mixedness or dispersiveness of a walk on a graph is the entropy rate @xmath36  @xcite , where @xmath37 is the shannon entropy of the set of all the trajectories of length @xmath18 generated from the walk rule , and @xmath38 is the minimum amount of information necessary to describe the process  @xcite . in particular , @xmath39 only if the walk generates exactly one possible trajectory , while @xmath38 is maximum when all the trajectories are equiprobable .
intuitively , walks with a high mixedness can explore remote regions of a graph within a relatively small number of time - steps .
this property is again desirable for the efficient exploration of unknown networks , where only local information is available . in particular , it is interesting to find a biasing function which guarantees that the walk does not remain trapped for too long in any region of the graph , and this is usually obtained by maximising the dispersiveness of the walk .
it is possible to show that the entropy rate for a markov process can be expressed as @xmath40 which means that @xmath38 depends only on the walk rule @xmath41 and on the stationary probability distribution  @xcite . by substituting the analytical expression for @xmath42 given in eq .
( [ eq : stationary ] ) into eq .
( [ eqentropyrate ] ) we get : @xmath43.\ ] ] this expression has a natural upper bound , which reflects the case of random walks where all trajectories of the same length have equal probability .
it is interesting to notice that , as shown by burda et al . in ref .
@xcite , the maximal value of entropy rate attainable by any walk on a given single - layer graph depends on the structure of the graph , and in particular for an undirected graph it is equal to @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the maximum eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of the graph .    this result can be extended to the case of walks on multiplex networks as follows . the total number of trajectories of length @xmath18 generated by a walk defined as in eq .
( [ eq : walk ] ) is equal to @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the @xmath18-th power of the overlapping adjacency matrix . in the limit of large @xmath18
, we have @xmath48 where @xmath45 is now the maximum eigenvalue of the overlapping adjacency matrix @xmath16 ( this result is a direct consequence of the application of the power method ) . in general , the maximal value of the entropy rate attainable with a particular motion rule will be smaller than or at most equal to @xmath49 .
since obtaining high mixedness is a desirable property of a walk in many real - world applications , such as when searching for a given resource on a graph , in the following we will look for combinations of the parameters of different motion rules which can produce high values of @xmath38 , to better approximate the corresponding value of @xmath50 allowed by the structure of the network .    _
heterogeneous mean - field .
 _ in the particular case in which the bias function @xmath51 depends only on the ( vectorial ) degree @xmath52}}_i , k{^{[2]}}_i , \ldots , k{^{[m]}}_i\}$ ] of node @xmath5 , where by definition @xmath53}}_i=\sum_{j}a{^{[\alpha]}}_{ij}$ ] is the degree of node @xmath5 at layer @xmath7 , the expression for the stationary probability distribution can be considerably simplified .
let us consider a heterogeneous mean - field , in which all the nodes belonging to the same degree class @xmath54 are structurally indistinguishable . under these assumption , and
since @xmath51 depends only on the degree , then for all the nodes @xmath5 having the same degree @xmath55 we have @xmath56 , but also @xmath57 , and similarly : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is an appropriate normalisation constant to ensure that @xmath60 .
( [ eq : meanfield ] ) means that all the nodes in the same degree class will have the same steady - state probability of being visited by the walk .
notice that @xmath61 is the expected number of edges connecting two nodes whose multiplex degree is respectively equal to @xmath54 and to @xmath62 .
if we assume that there are no edge correlations , i.e. that the probability of having @xmath4}}_{ij}=1 $ ] does not depend on the probability of having @xmath63}}_{ij}=1 $ ] for all the possible @xmath64 , then we can write : @xmath65 } } p({k'}{^{[\alpha]}}|k{^{[\alpha]}})\ ] ] since the expected number @xmath66 of edges between a node with degree @xmath54 and a node with degree @xmath62 is actually equal to the sum of the expected number of edges connecting these two nodes at each of the @xmath0 layers ( we indicate by @xmath67}}$ ] the degree at layer @xmath7 of a node whose vectorial degree is equal to @xmath68 .
if we additionally assume that there are no intra - layer correlations , then : @xmath69}}|k{^{[\alpha ] } } ) = q_{{k'}{^{[\alpha ] } } } =    \frac{{k'}{^{[\alpha ] } } p({k'}{^{[\alpha]}})}{{\langle { k'}{^{[\alpha ] } } \rangle}}\ ] ] where @xmath70}})$ ] is the degree distribution at layer @xmath7 . in the end
we find : @xmath71}}{k'}{^{[\alpha]}}p({k'}{^{[\alpha]}})}{{\langle { k'}{^{[\alpha ] } } \rangle}}.    \label{eq : p_star_k}\ ] ] this expression for @xmath72 is quite general , and in particular it is valid even in the presence of inter - layer degree - correlations  @xcite .
since the heterogeneous mean - field discards intra - layer and edge correlations , which usually contribute to hinder the dispersiveness of a walk , eq .
( [ eq : p_star_k ] ) can be readily plugged into the expression of the entropy rate in eq .
( [ eqentropyrate ] ) to obtain an estimate of the maximum value of @xmath38 attainable with a given biasing function on a multiplex network with an assigned multiplex degree sequence @xmath73 .
the introduction of a biasing function in the motion rule is mainly motivated by the necessity to obtain an exploration of the graph which is more efficient , i.e. , faster with respect to the time needed to visit all the nodes , or more homogeneous , i.e. , avoiding heterogeneities in the stationary distribution probability , in order to explore with the same probability each node of the graph . in single layer networks
these two aims are in general antithetical . for instance , a biasing function which maximises the mixing of the walk ( corresponding to higher values of entropy rate ) usually produces a quite heterogeneous stationary occupation probability , mainly due to the fact that a better mixing is obtained by exploiting the central role played by hubs .
high values of @xmath38 are usually achieved in a single - layer uncorrelated graph by a degree - biased walk @xmath74 with @xmath75 , and in general with a bias @xmath76 in graphs with non - trivial degree - degree correlations  @xcite . on the other hand ,
a uniform stationary occupation probability is obtained by using @xmath77 with @xmath78 in uncorrelated graphs , and in general by a value of @xmath79 for graphs with degree - degree correlations , which corresponds to forcing the walkers to preferentially move towards poorly connected nodes  @xcite .
the richness of multi - layer networks allows the exploration of more complex biasing functions and , as we will show in the following , usually produces quite interesting dynamics .
the reason of such richness is that the multiplex degree of a node @xmath5 is a vectorial rather than a scalar quantity , a fact that allows to construct several degree - based biasing functions . in the following we present two particular classes of such biasing functions , which we call _ extensive _ and _ intensive _ biases , respectively .    _ extensive bias functions .
 _ we call _ extensive _ those walks whose motion rule depends on a function of the degrees of the destination node at each of the @xmath0 layers .
a first example is that of _ additive _ degree - biased walks , defined by transition probabilities of the form : @xmath80}}_j)^{b_{\alpha } }    \label{eq : additive}\ ] ] where @xmath81 is the bias exponent associated to layer @xmath7 .
another example is that of _ multiplicative _ degree - biased walks , whose transition probability takes the form : @xmath82}}_j)^{b_{\alpha}}.    \label{eq : multiplicative}\ ] ] we named these walks `` extensive '' since the number of free parameters in the motion rule , namely the exponents @xmath83 , increases with the number of layers @xmath0 .
this peculiar property of extensive walks allows for a fine - grained setting of the bias in order to avoid nodes whose replicas on each of the @xmath0 layers belong to a specific degree class .
for instance , in the case of a two - layer multiplex , if we set @xmath84 and @xmath85 then the walkers will preferentially move towards node having , at the same time , high degree on layer @xmath86 and low degree on layer @xmath87 .
it might sometimes be desirable for a walker to have such sophisticated motion rules .
an example is that of multiplex collaboration networks , in which nodes are scientists and layers represent co - authorship patterns in different fields . in that case
, we might use an appropriately biased multiplex random walk which prefers to move towards nodes having a higher degree in a particular field , whose stationary probability distribution will represent a measure of the relative importance of each author in that field .
however , having a number of parameters which scales with the number of layers is not always a desirable property , especially if one wants to tune these parameters in order to obtain a walk with certain dynamical properties ( e.g. , either in terms of stationary probability or in terms of entropy rate ) .
this problem is efficiently solved by intensive bias functions .
_ intensive bias functions . 
_ we call _ intensive _ those multiplex walks whose motion bias depends on one or more intrinsically multiplex properties of the destination node . in the following
we will focus on the intensive walk whose transition probability reads : @xmath88 where @xmath89}}_j$ ] is the overlapping degree of node @xmath6 and @xmath90 is the multiplex participation coefficient of @xmath6 , and is defined as  @xcite : @xmath91}}{o_i}\biggr)^2\right ] .
\label{participationcoefficient}\ ] ] we notice that by considering @xmath92 and @xmath93 we are effectively using information about the _ distribution _ of the edges of the destination node across the layers . in particular , for fixed number of layers @xmath0 , @xmath94 is proportional to the average of the distribution defined by @xmath95}}_i , k{^{[2]}}_i , \ldots , k{^{[m]}}_i\}$ ] , while @xmath96 gives information about the homogeneity of @xmath97 , with @xmath98 if @xmath53}}_i\simeq \frac{1}{m } \sum_{\beta}k{^{[\beta]}}_i \ > \forall \alpha$ ] ( i.e. , if node @xmath5 has roughly the same degree at all layers ) and @xmath99 if almost all the edges of node @xmath5 lie on just one layer .
we notice that when @xmath100 the walkers will preferentially move towards hubs , while for @xmath101 they tend to visit the poorly connected nodes more often .
similarly , for positive values of @xmath102 the walkers will preferentially move towards _ truly multiplex nodes _ , i.e. nodes whose distribution of edges across the @xmath0 layers is more homogeneous , while for @xmath103 the walkers prefer to move towards _ focused nodes _
, i.e. those having the majority of their connections in just one or a few of the @xmath0 layers  @xcite . in general , by tuning the two parameters @xmath104 and @xmath102 we can obtain a rich variety of different walks .
for instance , for @xmath100 and @xmath105 , the walkers will be attracted by truly multiplex hubs ( i.e. , nodes with many links , almost equally distributed across the layers ) .
conversely , when @xmath100 and @xmath103 focused hubs are visited often and multiplex poorly connected nodes are strongly avoided , and so forth .
the unbiased multiplex walk is recovered for @xmath106 .
the most interesting characteristic of the intensive walk defined by eq .
( [ eq : intensive ] ) is that the number of free parameters is fixed and does not scale with the number of layers , as instead happens for extensive walks .
we will show in the following that intensive walks usually perform at least as well as extensive walks , e.g. with respect to the maximisation of entropy rate or to the minimisation of heterogeneity in the stationary occupation probability distribution .
it is worth noting that in the case of a duplex , i.e. when @xmath107 , even if the number of biasing parameters in intensive and extensive walks is the same , their effect on the motion of the walkers is different . differently from @xmath108 and @xmath109
, intensive biases do not allow to bias the walkers towards nodes with given properties in a particular layer but always consider intrinsically multiplex features , such as their total number of connections and their heterogeneity .    in order to explore the differences in the dynamical properties ( i.e. , the entropy rate @xmath38 and the normalised standard deviation of the stationary occupation probability distribution @xmath110 ) of biased multiplex walks , in the top panel of fig .
[ fig : fig1 ] we report the values of @xmath38 obtained by additive , multiplicative and intensive random walks as a function of the two bias exponents in a two - layer multiplex network whose layers have the same average degree @xmath111 and power - law degree distributions @xmath112 with @xmath113 , with no inter - layer correlations and no edge overlap of the power - law degree distribution are comparable to those shown in fig .  [ fig : fig1 ] and fig .
[ fig : fig2 ] , and are not reported for brevity . ] .
we notice that also in this simple case the three walks have remarkably different behaviours .
in particular , the additive walk exhibits a relative small sensitivity to the values of the biasing exponents , which results in smaller variations of @xmath38 .
in fact , there is a large region of @xmath108 ( i.e. @xmath114 ) within which the entropy rate is almost constant and not very different from the absolute maximum for a relatively large range of values of the other exponent @xmath109 , i.e. @xmath115 ( the same reasoning is valid for @xmath116 and @xmath117 , due to the symmetry of the additive bias function ) .
conversely , the picture is much richer and less trivial in the case of multiplicative and intensive walks , for which the maximum of @xmath38 is obtained for a relatively small range of parameters , usually corresponding to positive exponents .
we obtain slightly different results when we consider two layers with different power - law degree distributions @xmath118}})\sim \left(k{^{[1]}}\right)^{\gamma_1}$ ] and @xmath119}})\sim \left(k{^{[2]}}\right)^{\gamma_2}$ ] , namely with exponents @xmath120 and @xmath121 respectively . in this case
, the symmetry in the additive and multiplicative phase diagrams is broken , and the maximum values of @xmath38 are found by biasing the walk towards nodes with high degree on both layers , with a higher biasing exponent on the degree of the second layer , which has a more homogeneous degree distribution . also the phase diagram for the intensive walk is modified , with the line of maximum values becoming thinner .
similar considerations hold for the phase diagram of @xmath35 , reported in fig .  [
fig : fig2 ] . in this case , the minimum variance ( yielding a more homogeneous exploration of nodes ) is obtained for negative values of the two bias exponents .
moreover , the phase diagram exhibits quite small variations in the case of additive walk , while we observe more heterogeneity in the case of multiplicative and intensive walks .
again , the symmetry of the phase diagrams of the extensive walks is broken when pairs of layers with different power - law exponents @xmath122 , @xmath123 are considered , with the region @xmath124 showing greater variations than for @xmath125 .
qualitatively similar differences can be obtained with asymmetric layers with respect to other statistical properties , such as density .
all the results for synthetic networks , both in the current and following sections , have been obtained for layers with @xmath126 nodes and averaged over @xmath127 realisations .
in this section we illustrate how the structure of the multiplex network affects the maximal entropy rate and the minimum heterogeneity of the stationary occupation probability distribution achievable in the system .
we focus on five structural aspects , namely _
i ) _ the presence and sign of inter - layer degree - degree correlations , _ ii ) _ the existence of edge overlap across layers , _ iii ) _ the number @xmath0 of layers of the multiplex , _ iv ) _ the power - law exponent @xmath128 of the degree distribution of the layers , and _
v ) _ their density , measured through the average degree @xmath111 .
since our focus is on the construction of efficient walks ( in terms of maximal dispersiveness and of homogeneity of the stationary occupation probability ) the parameters of interest in all the cases are the overall maximum value of entropy rate , denoted by @xmath129 , and the minimum value of the normalised standard deviation , denoted by @xmath130 , obtained by extensive and intensive biased random walks as a function of the biasing parameters .
_ effect of inter - layer degree correlations .
 _ in a recent work  @xcite the authors have shown that real - world multiplex networks are usually characterised by non - trivial inter - layer degree correlation patterns . in the same paper
the authors propose several methods to quantify the presence of inter - layer correlations between a pair of layers , including the rank correlation among the two degree sequences , as measured by the spearman s coefficient @xmath131 .
if we call @xmath132}}_i$ ] the rank of node @xmath5 due to its degree on layer @xmath7 , the spearman rank correlation coefficient between layer @xmath7 and layer @xmath133 reads : @xmath134}}_i -          \overline { r{^{[\alpha ] } } }     \right )   \left ( r{^{[\beta]}}_i -         \overline { r{^{[\beta ] } } }       \right ) }      { \sqrt{\sum_i\left (    r{^{[\alpha]}}_i -          \overline { r{^{[\alpha ] } } }     \right)^2\sum_j \left (     r{^{[\beta]}}_j -   \overline { r{^{[\beta ] } } }   \right)^2}}\ ] ] where @xmath135 } } } $ ] and @xmath136 } } } $ ] are the average ranks of nodes respectively at layer @xmath7 and layer @xmath133 .
the coefficient @xmath131 takes values in @xmath137 $ ] , so that @xmath138 if the two degree sequences are perfectly correlated ( meaning that a hub at layer @xmath7 is also a hub at layer @xmath133 ) , while @xmath139 when the two degree sequence are perfectly anti - correlated , i.e. when a hub on layer @xmath7 is always a poorly connected node on the other layer , and viceversa .
intermediate positive ( resp .
negative ) values of @xmath131 indicate weaker positive ( negative ) inter - layer correlations , while @xmath140 when the two degree sequences are uncorrelated .    in fig .
[ fig : fig3](a ) we report the plot of @xmath141 and @xmath130 for extensive and intensive walks on two - layer multiplex networks with same average degree and power - law degree distributions @xmath112 with @xmath113 , for different levels of inter - layer degree correlations . as made evident by the figure
, intensive walks usually perform at least as well as extensive walks with respect to both maximisation of entropy and minimisation of the heterogeneity of the stationary occupation probability distribution .
this suggests that , aside from the actual differences in the phase space , intensive walks are able to span the same range of values of entropy and @xmath35 by using only two parameters , irrespective of the actual numbers of layers in the multiplex .
_ effect of edge overlap .
 _ we now investigate the impact of the presence of edge overlap on the long - term dynamics of extensive and intensive walks .
we recall here the definition of overlap for an edge @xmath142 , which is the fraction of layers in which the edge @xmath142 exists  @xcite , i.e. : @xmath143}}_{ij}.\ ] ] the edge overlap of a multi - layer network is defined as the average of @xmath144 over all the node pairs for which @xmath145 ( i.e. , for all pairs of nodes which are connected by at least one edge ) : @xmath146 where @xmath147 is the number of pairs of nodes which are connected in at least one of the @xmath0 layers .
notice that the average edge overlap @xmath148 is equal to @xmath86 only if all the @xmath0 layers are identical , while @xmath149 when every edge is present on exactly one of the @xmath0 layers .
( top panels ) and @xmath150 ( bottom panels ) as a function of the exponent @xmath128 of the the power - law distribution of each layer ( a ) and of the average degree @xmath111 ( b ) , respectively for additive ( triangles ) , multiplicative ( squares ) and intensive ( circles ) walks . for the entropy rate
, we also show the value of @xmath151 corresponding to the maximum entropy random walk ( solid line ) .
as shown , for all walks @xmath141 appears to increase as a function of both @xmath152 and @xmath111 .
smaller variations are also found in the values of @xmath130.,width=288 ]    we started from two - layer multiplex networks obtained by coupling identical layers ( thus having edge overlap equal to @xmath86 ) with power - law degree distributions @xmath112 with @xmath113 , and then we obtained multiplex networks with prescribed values of edge overlap by rewiring a certain percentage of the edges of one of the two layers in order to maintain the degree sequence unaltered .
notice that by construction the resulting multiplex networks have maximally positive inter - layer degree correlations ( i.e. , @xmath138 ) . as shown in fig .
[ fig : fig3](b ) , @xmath130 becomes higher as @xmath153 increases , meaning that higher values of edge overlap correspond to a more heterogeneous stationary state probability distribution .
conversely , @xmath141 decreases with @xmath153 , in accordance with the fact that higher edge overlap tends to hinder the dispersiveness of the walk , since a smaller number of distinct walks can originate from each node . summing up
, multiplex networks having smaller values of edge overlap are overall preferable in order to maximise the dispersiveness of the walk and to obtain a more homogeneous stationary occupation probability . in other words ,
a small edge overlap guarantees a more effective exploration of a multiplex network and , at the same time , a more homogeneous distribution of the probability of visiting each node .
_ effect of the number of layers .
 _ it is also interesting to study how the dynamical properties of intensive walks change when the number of layers @xmath0 is progressively increased . to this aim , we constructed multiplex networks with different number of layers , with no inter - layer degree correlations and negligible edge overlap , where all the layers had power - law degree distributions @xmath154 with @xmath113 .
as shown in fig .
[ fig : fig3](c ) , @xmath141 is an increasing function of @xmath0 , while @xmath130 decreases as the number of layers grows . in general , the addition of layers in absence of inter - layer correlation flattens the structural differences among the nodes of the multiplex , and provides better dispersiveness and less heterogeneity in the occupation probability distribution .
_ effect of the heterogeneity of the degree distribution .
 _ we investigate here how the heterogeneity of the the degree distribution of each layer affects @xmath141 and @xmath155 .
to this aim , we considered pairs of uncorrelated layers with the same power - law degree distribution @xmath112 for different values of @xmath128 , maintaining fixed the average degree of the networks @xmath111 . the plots in fig .
[ fig : fig4](a ) confirm that both @xmath141 and @xmath130 grow as @xmath128 increases , i.e. as the degree distribution of the layers becomes more homogeneous .
we notice though that the variation in @xmath130 appears to be relatively smaller , especially for multiplicative and intensive walks .
this result can be explained by considering that dispersiveness is favoured by more homogeneous degree distributions .
layers with different power - law exponents @xmath122 and @xmath123 have been considered in the previous section .
_ effect of layer density .
 _ finally , we focus on the effect of layer density , measured through the average degree of the layers @xmath111 .
once again we report here the case of uncorrelated layers with power - law exponent @xmath113 , but similar results have been obtained for other values of @xmath128 . as shown in fig .
[ fig : fig4](b ) , both @xmath141 and @xmath155 increase as a function of @xmath156 . layers with different average degrees @xmath157 } } \rangle$ ] and @xmath158 } }    \rangle$ ] break the symmetry of the phase diagrams for @xmath38 and @xmath159 qualitatively in a similar way as pairing layers with different power - law exponents .    summing up
, the analysis of the impact of structural properties on the values of @xmath141 and @xmath130 attainable on a multiplex network confirms that positive inter - layer degree correlations , small edge overlap , large number of layers , and more homogeneous layers all concur towards allowing biased random walks with nearly - optimal dispersiveness and closely - to - homogeneous steady - state visiting probability . in other words , a multiplex network with a large number of layers and small edge overlap , where nodes have roughly the same number of links at all layers
, can be explored ways more efficiently than a similar multiplex network where nodes have disassortative inter - layer correlations and edges are redundant across layers .    in the following section
we show that the multiplex airline transportation networks of all the six continents have evolved towards a structure which provides a good trade - off between efficient exploration and robustness .
as an application , we study here the dynamical properties of multiplex biased walks on a set of real - world systems , namely the six continental airline transportation networks . in such systems nodes represent airports , edges indicate the existence of a route between two airports and each layer is associated to an airline company , i.e. all the edges in a layer represent the routes operated by the corresponding airline .
such networks have been introduced and extensively studied in ref .  @xcite . as shown in table  [ tab:1 ] , all such multiplex networks consist of a relatively high number of layers .
for this reason , we will use intensive walks to compute the maximal entropy rate @xmath141 and the minimum value of the standard deviation of the stationary distribution @xmath130 . in table
[ tab:1 ] , we also report for each multiplex the average number of layers @xmath160 where each edge exists , the theoretical upper value of entropy rate @xmath161 , and the values of @xmath141 and @xmath130 obtained by optimising intensive walks .
.[tab:1 ] structural properties of the six continental airline transportation systems . for each multiplex
, we report the number of nodes @xmath1 , the number of layers @xmath0 , the average number of layers in which an edge exists @xmath162 , the theoretical upper value of entropy rate @xmath163 and the extremal values @xmath141 and @xmath130 obtained by optimising intensive walks . [ cols='<,<,<,<,<,<,<',options='header ' , ]     we notice that the efficiency of a transportation system is usually measured in terms of the accessibility of the locations it serves . in particular , in an ideal transportation system it should be easy to travel between any pair of far - apart regions of the network , mostly irrespective of where exactly those locations are located .
now , discarding the cost associated to the distance between the nodes of an airline transportation network , high accessibility can be obtained by guaranteeing that a traveller can reach remote locations in the system without large effort , in terms of number of interchanges , and that all locations can be visited with comparable effort .
we have seen that in the language of random walks these two criteria correspond , respectively , to the maximisation of dispersiveness and to the minimisation of the standard deviation of the visiting probability .
hence , we can ask whether the six continental air transportation systems can guarantee a good level of navigability , i.e. an optimal trade - off between dispersiveness and homogeneity of the visiting probability .
we reckon that a more informative analysis of the efficiency of these systems would require more detailed information about the actual patterns of trips travelled by passengers , the cost associated to each route , the presence of non - markovian effects ( people often come back to their original place at the end of a trip ) , the non - stationarity of the system due to seasonality , etc .. however , we argue that biased random walks can still provide useful , yet coarse - grained , information about the overall navigability of those systems . since we can not modify the degree distributions of each of the layers , or the patterns of inter - layer correlations , or the actual number of layers in each continental air transportation system , we focus here in particular on the effects of edge overlap .    in the previous section we showed
that networks with high edge overlap @xmath153 achieve lower maximal values of dispersiveness of the walk and larger heterogeneity of the equilibrium occupation probability distribution .
when two nodes are connected by more than one edge , indeed , from a dynamical point of the view some connections are wasted , since redundant links do not allow for new paths in the network . however , their redundancy might often be important for a transportation system , since it makes specific connections more robust to single link failures .
it is not unrealistic to assume that multi - layer transportation systems from the real - world have developed by satisfying a trade - off between the necessity to provide , at the same time , high diffusivity together with reasonable levels of robustness .
because of the large heterogeneity in the size and number of layers of the six continental transportation systems , it is necessary to introduce some kind of normalisation which allow to compare the results observed in different systems . in order to test the effect of edge overlap on the diffusion properties of real - world systems , for each of the six multiplex networks we computed the z - score of the average edge overlap : @xmath164 where @xmath165 and @xmath166 represent respectively the average value and the standard deviation of the overlap computed on an ensemble of suitably randomised multiplex networks . in particular , for each continental airline system we sampled @xmath127 multi - layer graphs from the configuration model which maintains fixed the degree sequence of all the layers and rearranges the links on each layer , pairing edge stubs at random .
we computed also @xmath167 and @xmath168 , i.e. the z - scores of the maximal entropy rate and minimum variance over those @xmath127 multiplex graphs .
the results reported in fig .  [ fig : fig5 ] confirm that also in real - world systems @xmath141 is negatively correlated with edge overlap , in agreement with the results obtained on synthetic networks .
similarly , @xmath169 is positively correlated with @xmath153 .
notice that we have @xmath170 in all the six continents , meaning that the edge overlap of the real - world systems is always higher than that of the null - model , in agreement with the observation that real - world transportation networks tend to guarantee a certain level of robustness to failures .
however , the quest for robustness has a cost in terms of dispersiveness and accessibility . in fact , @xmath141 is consistently smaller than the value observed in the randomised systems ( @xmath171 ) for all continents , and similarly the steady - state probability distribution is consistently larger than that observed in the null model ( @xmath172 )    it is quite interesting to note that the two multiplex networks with smallest overlap and overall better diffusion properties are the continental networks of oceania and europe , which span the least geographical space .
we can speculate that in such systems some nodes representing cities in different countries are connected comparably well by different modes of transport , such as trains and bus , suited for relatively short distances and not included in our analysis .
this might potentially explain the relative low number of redundant edges in those two airline transportation systems .
conversely , the necessity to provide route redundancy has somehow forced the airline transportation networks of asia , south america and north america towards slightly less efficient configurations .
in our work we have explored how to extend biased random walks to the case of multiplex networks , showing that the richness of multi - layer systems allows to define several different classes of walks .
in particular we studied the general features of the so - called extensive walkers ( where the node properties , as the degree , are considered separately at each of the layers with different biasing parameters ) and intensive walkers ( biased on of the product two intrinsically multiplex , namely the overlapping degree and the participation coefficient ) finding closed forms for the stationary occupation probability of these walks and for the entropy rate , and provided simplified heterogeneous mean - field expressions for the case in which the multiplex has no correlations .
we thoroughly investigated how structural properties of the multiplex , such as its number of layers , the presence of edge overlap and/or inter - layer degree correlations , the density of the layers and the heterogeneity of their degree distribution affect the dynamics of the random walkers .
we found that number of layers , edge overlap and inter - layer degree correlations have a substantial impact on the diffusion properties of the walks .
also , we found that intensive random walkers perform at least as well as extensive random walkers in all the considered scenarios , with the advantage that the number of bias parameters does not scale with the number of layers .
finally , the study of the diffusion properties of six real - world multiplex networks , namely the continental airline transportation networks of africa , asia , europe , oceania , north and south america , has shed some new light on the interplay between efficiency and robustness in multi - layer transportation systems . in particular
, we found that the emerging necessity to provide some resilience to single link failures , which corresponds to the introduction of some level of edge overlap , has shaped these systems in such a way that their navigability , in terms of entropy rate and heterogeneity of the node occupation probability , has somehow been sacrificed in favour of robustness .
the results of the present work represent a valuable theoretical contribution to the development of efficient strategies to explore , search or navigate multiplex networks , and confirm the importance of appropriately taking into account the multiplexity of interactions when modelling intrinsically multi - dimensional systems .

 biased random walks , i.e. walks whose motion is biased on properties of neighbouring nodes , have been largely exploited to design smart local strategies to explore a network , for instance by constructing maximally mixing trajectories or by allowing an almost uniform sampling of the nodes . here 
 we introduce and study biased random walks on multiplex networks , graphs where the nodes are related through different types of links organised in distinct and interacting layers , and we provide analytical solutions for their long - time properties , including the stationary occupation probability distribution and the entropy rate . 
 we focus on degree - biased random walks and distinguish between two classes of walks , namely those whose transition probability depends on a number of parameters which is extensive in the number of layers , and those whose motion depends on intrinsically multiplex properties of the neighbouring nodes . 
 we analyse the effect of the structure of the multiplex network on the steady - state behaviour of the walkers , and we find that heterogeneous degree distributions as well as the presence of inter - layer degree correlations and edge overlap determine the extent to which a multiplex can be efficiently explored by a biased walk . finally we show that , in real - world multiplex transportation networks , the trade - off between efficient navigation and resilience to link failure has resulted into systems whose diffusion properties are qualitatively different from those of appropriately randomised multiplex graphs . 
 this fact suggests that multiplexity is an important ingredient to include in the modelling of real - world systems .    
 the network paradigm has proven to be a successful framework to study the intricate patterns of relations among the constituents of real - world complex systems , from the internet to the human brain  @xcite , and has revealed that the dynamical behaviours observed in such systems , such as information spreading , diffusion , opinion formation and synchronisation , are quite often affected and to some extent determined by the structure of the underlying interaction network  @xcite . 
 however , the recent availability of massive data sets of social , technological and biological systems has suggested that the classical complex network approach might fall somehow short in modelling systems whose elementary units can interact through more than one type of connections . 
 this is typical of many real - world systems , such as social networks , where people are connected through a variety of social relationships , e.g. kinship , friendship , collaboration , competition , or transportation systems , which often exploit different communication channels  @xcite . 
 such systems can be treated in terms of _ multi - layer _ or _ multiplex networks _  
 @xcite , where each layer describes a particular type of interaction among the nodes of the graph . 
 some recent works have confirmed that multi - layer networks are characterised by new levels of complexity  @xcite and that the interaction of multiple network layers can produce new interesting dynamical behaviours  @xcite .    in the realm of dynamical processes on networks  @xcite the simplicity and -still- 
 the richness of random walks has attracted much attention in recent years  @xcite . 
 random walks are the most simple way to explore a network using only local information , and the steady - state properties of a walk , including characteristic times , limiting occupation probability , and coverage , have tight relationships with the structure of the graph upon which the walk takes place  @xcite . 
 for this reason , random walks have also been successfully used as probes of network properties , with applications ranging from community detection  @xcite to taxonomy of real - world networks  @xcite . moreover , specific flavours of random walks are widely used for the exploration of online social networks , information networks and the like .    
 a class of random walkers of particular interest is that of walkers whose motion is biased on the structural properties of the network  @xcite . in its simplest possible version , 
 the considered _ biased random walks _ are markov processes whose transition probability is a parametric function of the topological properties of the destination node . in this way , by tuning the parameters of the biasing function one can force the walk to preferentially visit , or avoid , nodes exhibiting high or low values of given topological descriptors , such as the degree , clustering or betweenness . 
 in particular , degree - biased random walks have been used to define new centrality measures  @xcite , identify communities @xcite , and provide optimal exploration of a network using only local information  @xcite . 
 it has also been found that the dynamics of degree - biased random walks is strongly affected by the presence of degree - degree correlations in the structure of the network  @xcite , so that an appropriate choice of the structural bias can be used to perform efficient sampling of unknown networks .    in this article 
 we study several ways in which random walks can be extended to multi - layer networks , and we show how to devise appropriate ways to bias the walkers on the topological properties of the nodes at each layer in order to perform an efficient exploration of such systems . 
 we notice that random walks have already been applied to multi - layer networks , e.g. to quantify the impact of failures in interconnected systems  @xcite . 
 however , we will focus here on biased random walks and will investigate how the biasing function affects the dispersiveness of the walk and the steady - state occupation probability distribution . 
 the aim is to find walks which visit far away regions of a multiplex network within a relatively small number of steps , a property related to the dispersiveness of the walk , and , at the same time , guarantee that the probability for a walker to visit any node in the system is as close as possible to uniform , thus allowing to sample unknown graphs in an efficient way .    
 the presence of many interdependent layers allows to construct several classes of biased random walks , and in particular what we call _ extensive walks _ and _ intensive walks _ , where the difference between the two classes is in the dependence of the parameters of the biasing function on the number of layers of the system . in the former case , the biasing function depends on the structural properties of the destination node at all the layers of the system ( thus , the number of parameters is extensive in the number of layers ) , while in the latter case the bias depends on intrinsically multiplex properties of the destination node , which do not depend explicitly on the number of layers of the network .    for both classes of biasing functions , we provide analytical closed forms for the long - time properties of 
 the random walks , in terms of stationary probability distribution and entropy rate  @xcite , and we study the effect of different structural properties , including the number of layers , the presence and sign of inter - layer degree correlations , the redundancy of edges across layers , the density of the multiplex and the heterogeneity of the degree distributions , on the steady - state behaviour of these walks . 
 we find that all these properties have a remarkable effect on the maximal dispersiveness and on the steady - state occupation probability of biased random walks 
 .    finally , we study the diffusion properties of several real - world multiplex networks , namely the six continental airline transportation networks , and we show that in those cases the pressure to provide robust route alternatives has somehow hindered the overall diffusion properties of those systems . "
"in previous papers , an extended theory of electromagnetism was proposed @xcite and developed @xcite .
the evolution of cosmological scalar perturbations was studied in @xcite ; nevertheless , the authors assumed that the _ scalar _ perturbations of the electromagnetic field do not affect metric perturbations evolution .
they stated that this assumption holds both in the radiation dominated period and in the matter dominated era , that is to say , at any moment before dark energy domination .
hence , it affects the choice of the initial conditions for numerical integrations , which are always fixed in the radiation dominated era ( @xmath0 ) , when the cosmologically significant scales had superhorizon sizes .
moreover , in paper @xcite , the conservation law of standard electromagnetism , @xmath1 , is assumed , e.g. , to get eq .
( 2.3 ) from eq . ( 2.2 ) .
nevertheless , this law is not an equation of extended electromagnetism , whose true conservation law ( see below ) admits solutions with @xmath2 .
this fact is important in cosmology , where the law @xmath1 implies that only vector modes are involved in the expansion of the current @xmath3 , whereas the condition @xmath2 requires the existence of @xmath3 scalar modes .
we have introduced one of these modes ( see below ) in our general calculations .
we see that , in extended electromagnetism , there are scalar modes in the expansions of both the electromagnetic field @xmath4 ( a - modes ) and the current @xmath5 ( j - modes ) . since we have not convincing arguments proving that , initially , at @xmath0 , all these modes are negligible against the small scalar modes of the radiation fluid , we can not ensure that they do not affect metric perturbations . hence , the a and j scalar modes should not be neglected _ a priori _ in order to get the metric and fluid initial conditions for numerical integrations .
after these considerations it seems that the assumption used in @xcite is a simplifying condition which would require further justification ( if it exists ) . in this situation , it is obvious that a more general study of cosmological perturbations is worthwhile .
it is performed in this paper , where a general complete treatment of the cosmological perturbations is developed in the framework of extended electromagnetism .
our approach has various relevant properties : ( i ) it is gauge invariant , ( ii ) it does not involve approximating conditions , ( iii ) it involves a @xmath6 scalar mode as it is required by the general conservation law of extended electromagnetism , and ( iv ) it uses appropriate scalar modes for the field @xmath7 which evolve independently of the scalar gr - modes ( metric and fluid modes ) .
this paper is structured as follows : the basic equations of the vt theory are derived by using variational techniques in sec .
[ sec-2 ] , where the energy momentum tensor and the lorentz force are calculated .
the theory is applied to cosmology in sec .

an analysis of the equations derived in sec .
[ sec-3 ] is performed in sec .
[ sec-4 ] , where the equations satisfied by the scalar perturbations of the vector field are numerically solved , and the differences between the equations describing the evolution of the scalar modes in general relativity ( gr ) and in vt are studied .
the appendix contains some estimates in the framework of gr , which are useful in sec .
[ sec-4 ] . finally , sec .
[ sec-5 ] contains a general discussion and our main conclusions .
let us finish this section fixing some notation criteria .
latin ( greek ) indexes run from 1 to 3 ( 0 to 3 ) .
the gravitational constant , the scale factor , the conformal time , and the hubble constant are denoted @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 , respectively .
whatever function @xmath12 may be , @xmath13 stands for its partial derivative with respect to the coordinate @xmath14 , and @xmath15 represents its background value .
units are chosen in such a way that the speed of light is @xmath16 .
spatial distances are given in megaparsecs .
a charged isentropic perfect fluid is considered in the framework of the vt generalization of einstein - maxwell theory proposed in @xcite .
the basic equations are derived from the following action : @xmath17 \,\sqrt { - g } \,d^4 x   \ , \label{1.1}\ ] ] where @xmath18 is an arbitrary parameter , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 are the scalar curvature , the covariant metric components , and the determinant of the @xmath20 matrix , respectively .
the vector field of the theory is @xmath4 .
the symbol @xmath22 stands for the covariant derivative and we define @xmath23 .
the electrical current is @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the density of electrical charge and @xmath26 is the four - velocity of the fluid world lines .
finally , for an isentropic perfect fluid , one can introduce a conserved energy density @xmath27 [ @xmath28 and an internal energy @xmath29 ; so the fluid energy density is @xmath30 and the pressure is @xmath31 ( see @xcite ) .
some vt theories were proposed in the early seventies ( see @xcite ) .
all these theories were based on the action : @xmath32 where @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 are arbitrary parameters and @xmath37 is the matter lagrangian , which couples matter with the fields of the vt theory .
actions ( [ 1.1 ] ) and ( [ 1.2 ] ) are equivalent for @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 .    according to the variational techniques described in @xcite ,
three fields may be independently varied in the action ( [ 1.1 ] ) .
these fields are : the vector field of the theory ( @xmath42 ) , the flow lines of the fluid ( @xmath26 ) , and the metric field ( @xmath20 ) .
we first vary the field @xmath42 for fixed flow lines and metric ( @xmath43 variations ) .
thus , we easily obtain the field equations for the @xmath44 field , whose form is : @xmath45 where @xmath46 with @xmath47 .
then , from these field equations one easily gets the relation : @xmath48 which indicates that the total current @xmath49 is conserved in the theory .
this is the conserved current associated to the invariance of action ( [ 1.1 ] ) under the residual gauge transformation @xmath50 with @xmath51 .    in a second step ,
the flow lines are varied for fixed @xmath52 and @xmath20 ( @xmath53 variations ) and , moreover , the densities @xmath27 and @xmath25 are adjusted to satisfy the equation @xmath54 and eq .
( [ 1.4 ] ) , respectively ( see @xcite ) . since the right hand side of eq .
( [ 1.4 ] ) does not depends on @xmath55 , the following relation is satisfied @xmath56 . on account of these considerations ,
the following equations are easily obtained @xcite : @xmath57 these equations describe the fluid evolution in the vt theory .
the last term is the generalized lorentz force , @xmath58 , of the theory ; hence , we can write : @xmath59    finally , the metric is varied whereas fields @xmath52 and @xmath60 are fixed ( @xmath61 variations ) .
for this kind of variations , eq  ( [ 1.4 ] ) leads to the relation @xmath62 and , then , from this relation and the identity @xmath63 = ( \nabla \cdot a)^{2 }   + a_{\mu } \nabla^{\mu } ( \nabla \cdot a ) $ ] , it follows that the lagrangian densities @xmath64 [ involved in action ( [ 1.1 ] ) ] and @xmath65 are fully equivalent . on account of this fact ,
@xmath61 variations lead to : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the einstein tensor and @xmath68 is the energy momentum tensor of the charged fluid plus the electromagnetic field , whose form is : @xmath69 \ . \label{1.8}\end{aligned}\ ] ] this energy momentum tensor is to be compared with that given in @xcite taking into account differences in the assumed signature .
equations  ( [ 1.3 ] ) , ( [ 1.5 ] ) , and ( [ 1.7 ] ) are the field equations of the theory .
any solution of these equations satisfies eq .
( [ 1.4 ] ) , and also the relations @xmath70 .
these last relations combined with all the field equations and eq .
( [ 1.8 ] ) lead to : @xmath71u^{\alpha } = 2f^{\alpha \beta } j^{^{a}}_{\beta } - 2 a^{\alpha } \nabla^{\beta } j^{^{a}}_{\beta } \ . \label{1.9}\ ] ] in the einstein - maxwell theory , which is formally obtained in the limit @xmath72 , eq  ( [ 1.9 ] ) reduces to @xmath73 ( which is identical to eq .
( 3.9 ) in @xcite ) .
after this detailed variational study , which has not been previously developed , we are concerned with cosmological applications .
from the field equations of sec .  [ sec-2 ] , one easily finds the equations describing a homogeneous and isotropic neutral flat universe , in which the line element is @xmath74\ . \label{2.1}\ ] ] the vector field , a , and the four - velocity , u , of the cosmic fluid have the covariant components @xmath75 $ ] and @xmath76 $ ] , respectively .
the energy density is the critical one , whose present value is @xmath77 , and the density of charge is @xmath78 for any time . in this background , eqs .
( [ 1.3 ] ) reduces to @xmath79 = constant    \ , \label{coscons}\ ] ] and eq .
( [ 1.8 ] ) leads to the relations @xmath80 where quantities @xmath81 and @xmath82 are the background energy density and pressure of the vector field @xmath44 , respectively .
the equation of state ( [ eqest ] ) proves that the energy density of the background field @xmath44 play the role of a cosmological constant . in order to have positive values of @xmath81
the parameter @xmath83 must be negative .
hereafter units are chosen in such a way that @xmath84 ; thus , from eqs .
( [ 1.7 ] ) and ( [ 1.8 ] ) one easily get the following basic cosmological equation for the background evolution : @xmath85 @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 are the background energy density and pressure of the cosmological fluid ( baryons plus dark matter and radiation ) .
hereafter , @xmath89 and @xmath90 stand for the ratios @xmath91 and @xmath92 , respectively .    in next sections ,
perturbations are described in the usual way with the formalism summarized in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .
there are three types of perturbations whose evolution is independent during the linear regime .
they are the so - called scalar , vector , and tensor fluctuations , which may be expanded in terms of the scalar , @xmath93 , vector , @xmath94 , and tensor , @xmath95 , harmonics , respectively .
there are no tensor modes involved in the expansion of vectors @xmath4 and @xmath5 ; hence , in the vt theory , tensor modes only appear in the expansions of the same quantities as in gr ( metric and anisotropic part of the stress tensor ) and , moreover , they satisfy the same equations as in gr .
therefore , we are mainly interested in scalar and vector modes .
metric tensor modes ( gravitational waves ) and anisotropic stress tensor components evolve as in gr , namely , they satisfy the equation : @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the tensor part of the anisotropic stress tensor and @xmath98 the tensor part of the metric ( see @xcite ) .    for negligible anisotropic stress ,
cosmological fluctuations evolving well outside the effective horizon ( @xmath99 , see @xcite ) obey the equation @xmath100 , whose general solution is @xmath101 ; hence , @xmath102 is a fast decaying mode .
this means that well after reheating , e.g. at @xmath103 , superhorizon scales evolve in such a way that quantity @xmath104 is almost independent of time .
this fact will be taken into account below .      in the case of a flat background
, the vector harmonics can be written as follows @xcite : @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the wavenumber vector . a representation of vectors @xmath107 and @xmath108 is @xcite : @xmath109 where @xmath110 .
the first order vector part of the fields @xmath42 and @xmath111 may be written as follows : @xmath112 \ , \label{2.3}\ ] ] @xmath113 \ , \label{2.4}\ ] ]    as it is done in standard electromagnetism ( einstein - maxwell theory ) , we define the covariant components of the electric and magnetic fields ( @xmath114 and @xmath115 ) as follows : @xmath116 and @xmath117 where quantities @xmath118 are the levy - civita symbols
. then , at first order in perturbation theory , one easily finds : @xmath119    \ . \label{cocom}\ ] ] equations .
( [ 2.2])([2.4 ] ) , and ( [ cocom ] ) lead to the following equations in momentum space : @xmath120 hereafter we use the following equivalences : @xmath121 , @xmath122 , and @xmath123 .
moreover , @xmath124 and @xmath125 stand for the ordinary divergence and curl of @xmath126 , respectively .    by using this notation and eqs .
( [ eb1 ] ) it is easily verified that , up to first order , the equation @xmath127 is satisfied in position space .
finally , since the ordinary divergence of any vector mode vanishes , we can write @xmath128    let us now consider the field equations ( [ 1.3 ] ) , which may be rewritten as follows : @xmath129_{/ \alpha } f^{\beta \alpha } +   f^{\beta \alpha}_{\,\,\,\,\,\,\ , / \alpha } = j^{\beta } -2\gamma g^{\beta \alpha } ( \nabla \cdot a)_{/ \alpha } \ . \label{fieldeq}\ ] ] since @xmath130 and @xmath131 are scalars , they may be expanded in scalar harmonics with no contributions from vector modes ; hence , the term @xmath132 vanishes in the case of vector modes and , consequently , eqs .
( [ fieldeq ] ) reduces to those of einstein - maxwell theory . by using eqs .
( [ cocom ] ) and ( [ fieldeq ] ) , it may be easily verified that for vector modes and up to first order , einstein - maxwell field equations and eqs  ( [ fieldeq ] ) may be written as follows : @xmath133 @xmath134    finally , from eqs .
( [ 2.4 ] ) , ( [ eb1 ] ) , and ( [ posrot_e1 ] ) , the following equation describing the evolution of @xmath135 is found : @xmath136    for a given function @xmath137 , the solution of eq .
( [ a1evol ] ) gives @xmath138 and then , quantities @xmath139 and @xmath140 are fixed by eqs .
( [ eb1 ] ) . from these last quantities
we may calculate @xmath141 and @xmath142 by using the explicit form ( [ 2.2 ] ) of the vector harmonics .
the resulting @xmath143 and @xmath144 quantities satisfy the four eqs .
( [ posrot_b1 ] ) , ( [ posdiv_b1 ] ) , ( [ posrot_e1 ] ) , and ( [ posdiv_e1 ] ) in position space .    the equations of this subsection are valid in the vt theory under consideration as well as in the standard einstein maxwell theory .
it is due to the fact that vector modes do not contribute to the terms involving @xmath83 either in eq .
( [ fieldeq ] ) or in eq .
( [ 1.8 ] ) , and these terms are responsible for all the differences between both theories .
the predictions of these theories only may be different due to the scalar modes involved in the vector fields @xmath4 and @xmath3 , which are studied in next subsection .      for a flat background ,
the scalar harmonics are plane waves ; namely , @xmath145 .
the first order scalar contributions to vectors @xmath42 and @xmath111 are : @xmath146 \ , \label{2.3b}\ ] ] @xmath147 \ , \label{2.4b}\ ] ] where @xmath148 .
since we assume that the universe is neutral up to first order , the component @xmath149 vanishes and , moreover , taking into account that the equation @xmath150 is not an equation of the vt theory , a scalar part @xmath151 must be included in the expansion of @xmath152 .
equations ( [ 2.3b ] ) and ( [ 2.4b ] ) are absolutely general .    equations ( [ cocom ] ) and ( [ 2.3b ] ) may be combined to get : @xmath153 similarly , the scalar @xmath130 may be expanded in terms of scalar harmonics ; namely , we can write : @xmath154 in order to calculate @xmath155 , we must use the relation @xmath156 , which involves the christoffeld symbols .
it is then evident that @xmath157 depends on the coefficients @xmath158 and @xmath159 appearing in the expansion of @xmath42 [ see eq .
( [ 2.3b ] ) ] , and also on the coefficients involved in the expansion of the metric components @xmath20 , which appear in the christoffeld symbols .
if the resulting @xmath157 is used to write eqs .
( [ fieldeq ] ) , ( [ 1.7 ] ) and ( [ 1.8 ] ) up to first order in scalar modes , all the equations are coupled among them and their solution only have been found under special assumptions ( see @xcite and sec .
[ intro ] ) .
however , we have developed a method , in which we may first solve eqs .
( [ fieldeq ] ) and , then , the solution can be used to solve eqs .
( [ 1.7 ] ) and ( [ 1.8 ] ) .
let us now describe this method and derive the evolution equations for the scalar modes .
coefficients @xmath158 and @xmath159 are not the most suitable ones in order to expand the field equations .
it is preferable the use of the coefficients @xmath160 and @xmath157 , which are gauge invariant quantities . in terms of these variables ,
( [ fieldeq ] ) reduce to : @xmath161 @xmath162 and eq .
( [ 1.4 ] ) may be written as follows : @xmath163 since eq .
( [ 1.4 ] ) is a consequence of eqs .
( [ fieldeq ] ) , which are equivalent to eqs .
( [ 1.3 ] ) , eq .
( [ fe12 ] ) may be easily obtained by combining eqs .
( [ fe1 ] ) and ( [ fe2 ] ) .
hence , functions @xmath157 and @xmath160 may be found by solving eqs .
( [ fe1 ] ) and ( [ fe2 ] ) for a given @xmath164 plus initial values of @xmath157 and @xmath160 and , then , the resulting @xmath157 and @xmath160 functions and the chosen @xmath164 will satisfy eq .
( [ fe12 ] ) .
equation  ( [ fe2 ] ) may be easily derived from eqs .
( [ fe1 ] ) and ( [ fe12 ] ) and , consequently , we may also proceed as follows : eq .
( [ fe12 ] ) is solved for a given @xmath164 and initial values of @xmath157 and @xmath165 and , then , the resulting solution @xmath157 is used to get function @xmath160 by using eq .
( [ fe1 ] ) .
obviously , eq .
( [ fe2 ] ) is satisfied by the @xmath157 and @xmath160 functions we have found by solving eqs .
( [ fe12 ] ) and ( [ fe1 ] ) .
it is worthwhile to point out that eqs .
( [ gw ] ) and ( [ fe12 ] ) have the same form . in fact , if we replace @xmath166 by @xmath157 and @xmath167 by @xmath168 in eq .
( [ gw ] ) , the resulting equation is identical to eq .
( [ fe12 ] ) .
condition @xmath169 in eq .
( [ fe12 ] ) is equivalent to condition @xmath170 in ( [ gw ] ) .
hence , some previous conclusions about the evolution of gravitational wave modes would be also valid for the @xmath157 evolution ; in particular , for @xmath171 and superhorizon scales , the relation @xmath172 holds .    in extended electromagnetism
, function @xmath164 does not vanish _ a priori_. condition @xmath169 implies the relation @xmath173 in position space , but this relation is not a basic equation of the theory . by this reason , function @xmath164 is included in the equations derived in this section ; nevertheless , there is no by the moment any physically motivated rule to build up this function .
anyway , for a given @xmath164 ( including the cosmological possibility @xmath169 ) , eqs .
( [ fe1 ] ) and ( [ fe2 ] ) involve : the constant @xmath174 , the wavenumber @xmath175 , the scale factor , functions @xmath157 and @xmath160 , and their first order derivatives .
these equations do not involve scalar perturbations associated to the metric and the energy momentum tensor .
they may be easily solved for given values of @xmath18 and @xmath175 , and initial values of @xmath157 and @xmath160 ( alternatively we may solve eq .
( [ fe12 ] ) for initial values of @xmath157 and @xmath176 ) .
the resulting function @xmath157 appears in the expansion of eqs .
( [ 1.7 ] ) and ( [ 1.8 ] ) in scalar harmonics ( see below ) .
the gauge invariant formalism described in @xcite is used in this paper ; namely , the metric , the four - velocity , and the part of the energy momentum tensor ( [ 1.8 ] ) being independent of the parameter @xmath18 are all expanded as follows ( in the flat case ) : @xmath177                       \nonumber \\ & & u_{i } = a v^{(0 ) } q^{(0)}_{i } , \,\,\,\ , \rho=\rho_{b}(1+\delta q^{(0 ) } ) \nonumber \\ & & t_{ij } = p_{b}(1+\pi_{l } q^{(0)})\delta_{ij } + p_{b}\pi_{t}^{(0)}q_{ij}^{(0 ) }   \ .\end{aligned}\ ] ] any other quantity as , e.g. , @xmath178 , @xmath179 , and so on , may be easily written in terms of the coefficients involved in these equations ( see @xcite ) , which may be combined to build up the following gauge invariant variables : @xmath180    the complementary part of the energy momentum tensor ( [ 1.8 ] ) ; namely , the part depending on @xmath18 may be easily expanded in terms of scalar harmonics .
the resulting expansion involves the variable @xmath157 and its first order time derivative ( or equivalently @xmath157 and @xmath160 ) .    in order to expand eqs .
( [ 1.7 ] ) and ( [ 1.8 ] ) and the relation @xmath181 , we use the same gauge invariant potentials and variables as in @xcite ) ( see above ) , plus the gauge invariant variables @xmath157 , @xmath160 , and @xmath164 .
the resulting equations reads as follows : @xmath182    \ , \label{fh}\ ] ] @xmath183 @xmath184 @xmath185 eqs .
( [ fh ] ) to ( [ em ] ) plus ( [ baseq1 ] ) and ( [ baseq2 ] ) may be combined to get the following equation for the evolution of @xmath186 : @xmath187   ( \rho_{b } a^{3 } \epsilon_{m})= \nonumber \\ & & -k^{2}(p_{b } a^{3 } \eta ) - 2\dot{a } ( p_{b } a^{2 } \pi_{t}^{(0)})\,\dot { } + \frac{2}{3 } k^{2 } ( p_{b } a^{3 } \pi_{t}^{(0 ) } ) \nonumber \\ & &                         + 2 \rho_{b } a^{2 } \big [ w - c_{s}^{2 } -   ( 1+c_{s}^{2})\frac { \rho^{a}_{b } } { \rho_{b } } \big ] ( p_{b } a^{3 } \pi_{t}^{(0 ) } )     \nonumber \\ & &   -2 \gamma a^{3 } \xi_{b } ( \rho_{b}+p_{b } ) ( 2a_{0b } \dot{\xi}^{(0 ) } -   \xi_{b } a^{2 } \xi^{(0 ) } ) \nonumber \\ & & -ka^{3}\big(a_{0b}\dot{j}^{(0)}+ \big[(2 + 3c_{s}^{2})\frac { \dot{a}}{a } a_{0b}-a^{2 } \xi_{b } \big ] j^{(0 ) }
\big ) \ . \label{emt }      \end{aligned}\ ] ] for @xmath188 , @xmath171 , and @xmath189 , eqs .  ( [ fh ] ) to ( [ emt ] )
reduce to the equations derived by bardeen in the flat case @xcite . for @xmath188 , @xmath171 , and @xmath190 , eqs .
( [ fh ] ) to ( [ emt ] ) describe fluctuation evolution in a standard flat universe with a cosmological constant whose energy density is @xmath191 .
finally , if @xmath192 , and the two functions @xmath6 and @xmath193 do not vanish at the same time , eqs .
( [ fh ] ) , ( [ em ] ) , and ( [ emt ] ) contain new terms , which modify the equations describing perturbation evolution in flat universes with cosmological constant .
in this section , it is assumed that the condition @xmath171 holds in cosmology , which is equivalent to assume the well known conservation law of einstein - maxwell theory ( @xmath1 ) . under this arbitrary assumption , we study the background equations ( [ coscons])([baseq2 ] ) , and the equations  ( [ fe1])([fe12 ] ) , and  ( [ fh])([emt ] ) describing the evolution of the first order scalar perturbations in momentum space .    we begin with the background equations .
function @xmath194 and @xmath195 are given by the formulas @xmath196 where @xmath197 and @xmath198 are the present energy density of radiation and matter    moreover , the baryon density is assumed to be @xmath199 , and the value of the hubble constant is @xmath200 with @xmath201 .
all these values are compatible with a certain version of the concordance model ( see @xcite ) . in this model , the dark energy density , @xmath81 , is easily obtained from the relation @xmath202 , which is valid in flat backgrounds .
equation ( [ baseq1 ] ) governing the evolution of the scale factor may be numerically solved for the above parameters ; thus , the evolution of the scale factor is obtained .
the resulting function @xmath203 is necessary to study the remaining equations of the theory ; namely , eqs .
( [ fe1])([fe12 ] ) and also eqs .
( [ fh])([emt ] ) .    from eq .
( [ eqest ] ) one easily gets the relation @xmath204 ( negative @xmath18 ) . once the value of @xmath192 is fixed ( see above ) , this last relation leads to @xmath205 , where @xmath206 only may take on the values @xmath207 and @xmath208 . for a given value of @xmath209 ,
only the absolute value of @xmath210 may be obtained ( its sign is arbitrary ) . on account of eq .
( [ coscons ] ) , we may also write the relation @xmath211 . in the background ,
quantities @xmath209 and @xmath212 remain arbitrary .
hereafter , @xmath213 stands for the initial value of quantity @xmath214 whatever it may be .
let us now consider eqs .
( [ fe1])([fe12 ] ) .
we first solve eq .
( [ fe12 ] ) by using initial values @xmath215 and @xmath216 at redshift @xmath217 . at this high redshift ,
the cosmological scales of interest ( see below ) are superhorizon ones ; hence , taking into account the similarity between eqs .
( [ gw ] ) and
( [ fe12 ] ) and the comments in the last paragraph of sec .  [ sec-3a ] , the condition @xmath171 assumed in this section allows us to take @xmath218 .
only the initial value of @xmath157 may be appropriately chosen to integrate eq .
( [ fe12 ] ) .
the values of @xmath209 and @xmath212 are fully irrelevant to perform this integration .
hereafter , numerical calculations are performed for the spatial scale @xmath219 , which reenters the effective horizon at present time ( @xmath220 ) .
its wavenumber is @xmath221 .
this scale is useful for normalization in gr ( see the appendix ) .
equation  ( [ fe12 ] ) has been solved for the wavenumber @xmath222 with the initial condition @xmath223 in position space . in order to write the corresponding initial condition in momentum space
, we use the well known relation @xcite @xmath224 where @xmath225 is an arbitrary quantity .
evidently , this relation must be particularized for @xmath226 , @xmath227 , and @xmath228 to calculate @xmath229 .
either this last initial quantity ( in momentum space ) or @xmath230 ( in position space ) may be seen as a normalization constant .
the @xmath157 spectrum would be necessary to derive the initial value of @xmath231 for @xmath232 .
functions @xmath233 ( top ) , @xmath234 ( middle ) and @xmath235 ( bottom ) in terms of @xmath236 , for @xmath237 , @xmath238 , @xmath239 , and @xmath240 .
, scaledwidth=40.0% ]    the solution of eq .
( [ fe12 ] ) plus eq .
( [ fe1 ] ) allow us to calculate function @xmath160 which is proportional to @xmath241 .
numerical integrations have given the functions @xmath233 , @xmath234 , and @xmath242 represented in fig .
[ figu1 ] .
these functions correspond to @xmath238 , @xmath239 , @xmath243 , and @xmath240 .
since the dependence of these functions in terms of the parameters @xmath209 , @xmath212 , and @xmath244 is known ( see above ) , fig .
[ figu1 ] contains complete information about the scalar modes associated to the field @xmath4 for the scale @xmath245 .
the same may be done for any linear spatial scale with the help of an appropriate spectrum for @xmath215 .
let us now study the eqs .
( [ fh])([emt ] ) describing the evolution in the framework of extended electromagnetism of the scalar modes appearing in standard gr cosmology .
equations ( [ fh ] ) , ( [ em ] ) , and ( [ emt ] ) contain the terms : @xmath246    \ , \label{fhnew}\ ] ] @xmath247 @xmath248 respectively .
these terms which appear in extended electromagnetism but not in einstein theory with cosmological constant may be calculated , for the scale @xmath245 , by using the integration data used to build up fig .
[ figu1 ] and , then , these terms may be compared with appropriate terms involved in gr equations ( for the same wavenumber ) .
taking into account that @xmath210 and @xmath249 are proportional to @xmath250 and also that @xmath157 does not depend on @xmath206 and @xmath209 , it is trivially proved that quantities @xmath251 , @xmath252 , and @xmath253 are also independent of @xmath206 and @xmath209 . for the wavenumber @xmath222 ,
these quantities are proportional to the number @xmath254 .    as it follows from eqs .
( [ fh ] ) , ( [ em ] ) ( [ emt ] ) , quantities @xmath251 , @xmath252 , and @xmath253 are to be compared with the gr values of the terms @xmath255 @xmath256 @xmath257   ( \rho_{b } a^{3 } \epsilon_{m } )   \ , \label{emtgr}\ ] ] respectively .
after the estimation of @xmath258 , @xmath259 , and @xmath260 in standard cosmology ( based on gr ) , the three functions @xmath261 may be calculated .
evidently , for very small @xmath262 values , gr and extended electromagnetism would lead to the same differential equations for the evolution of the gr scalar perturbations , whereas @xmath262 values of the order of @xmath263 or greater would suggest relevant differences with respect to gr .
if differences are expected , the matter power spectrum @xmath264 and the angular power spectra of the cmb should be accurately estimated by using numerical codes as cmbfast @xcite and camb @xcite . these accurate calculations -under general enough initial conditions are beyond the scope of this paper .
the @xmath265 ratios will be estimated for the wavenumber @xmath245 .
the corresponding spatial scale is useful for normalization in gr , which is necessary to estimate the functions @xmath266 .
the method used for the estimation of these functions and for normalization in standard gr cosmology are described in the appendix .
the three functions @xmath267 are represented in fig .  [ figu2 ] for @xmath240 .
two panels ( left and right ) show the evolution of each ratio @xmath262 .
the evolutions of the three ratios are similar . from @xmath103 to @xmath268 ,
the chosen spatial scale is well outside the effective horizon and all the ratios increase without oscillations ( see left panels ) ; however , for @xmath269 , there are oscillations whose amplitudes grow as @xmath270 decreases ( see right panels ) .
it is due to the fact that our spatial scale and that of the effective horizon come near as the redshift decreases ( they have been chosen to be identical at @xmath271 ) .
the maximum values of the ratios are @xmath272 , @xmath273 , and @xmath274 .
these maximum values are all reached close to @xmath275 .
they are small enough to ensure that , for @xmath240 , the chosen scale evolves as in gr .

an exhaustive variational formulation of extended electromagnetism has been presented in sec .
[ sec-2 ] .
in particular , the energy momentum tensor of the vector field @xmath4 has been found .
this tensor has been analyzed to conclude that the last term of eq .
( [ 1.8 ] ) has not the same sign as in previous calculations @xcite .
our sign appears as a result of the relation @xmath62 , which is consistent with the conservation law of @xmath283 .
this sign is only compatible with a negative constant @xmath18 ( see sec.[sec-3 ] ) .
our formulation also leads to eqs .
( [ 1.6 ] ) giving the components of the lorentz force and to eq .
( [ 1.9 ] ) .
we have emphasized that , for vector and tensor linear perturbation of the friedman - robertson - walker universe , extended electromagnetism is fully equivalent to einstein - maxwell theory .
although this fact was already known ( see @xcite ) , our detailed but brief study of vector and tensor perturbations is necessary to describe our approach to the evolution of scalar modes and , moreover , this study exhibits novel aspects .
note that : ( i ) our brief considerations about tensor perturbations have been used to study the evolution of some scalar modes [ analogy between eqs .
( [ gw ] ) and ( [ fe12 ] ) ] , ( ii ) our analysis of vector perturbations leads to new relations in momentum space derived from eqs .
( [ 2.2 ] ) and , ( iii ) this analysis suggests the definition of the gauge invariant quantity @xmath160 , which plays a crucial role in our description of the scalar modes .    a new approach to deal with the evolution of the scalar modes in extended electromagnetism has been described .
it is gauge invariant and fully general .
this formalism leads to eqs  ( [ fe1])([fe12 ] ) and eqs .
( [ fh])([emt ] ) , which are the most important findings of this paper .
the scalar modes associated to the vector field @xmath4 are assumed to be @xmath193 and @xmath284 .
then , in sec .  [ sec-3c ]
, it is proved that the evolution equations of these gauge invariant modes [ eqs  ( [ fe1])([fe12 ] ) ] do not involve any other scalar mode ( excepting @xmath164 ) .
these simple equations may be easily solved by using standard numerical methods for any given function @xmath164 .    in sec .
[ sec-4 ] , where the simplifying condition @xmath169 is assumed , the solution of eqs  ( [ fe1])([fe12 ] ) may be found by using the initial value of @xmath193 at @xmath0 , whereas the initial values of both @xmath165 and @xmath285 [ related by eq .
( [ fe1 ] ) ] may be neglected .
the solution corresponding to a particular wavenumber @xmath245 ( reentering the effective horizon at present time ) is presented in fig .
[ figu1 ] .
there is no problem to integrate eqs  ( [ fe1])([fe12 ] ) for any other scale . since we have the numerical solutions of these equations , the correction terms @xmath286 appearing in eqs .
( [ fh])([emt ] ) may be numerically treated as known functions of @xmath175 and @xmath10 and , consequently , these last equations only involve as unknown functions the scalar modes appearing in gr .
their numerical solution has not been found in this paper ; where the correction terms @xmath286 have been compared with appropriate terms of the gr equations ( @xmath287 ) for suitable values of @xmath175 and @xmath288 .
for the chosen scale @xmath245 and @xmath289 , the scalar modes would evolve as in gr .
the spectrum of @xmath193 and the standard power spectrum @xmath290 , at initial time , would be necessary to perform similar comparisons for all the cosmological scales .
if all the scales are found to evolve as in gr , both theories are equivalent from the cosmological point of view ; on the contrary , some appropriate code , as e.g. , cmbfast or camb , may be modified to estimate in the vt the angular power spectrum of the cmb , the matter power spectrum , and so on .    in the background ,
functions @xmath291 and @xmath292 can not be fully fixed .
both functions are proportional to @xmath293 , but these parameters are arbitrary . moreover , function @xmath193 and the correction terms @xmath286 defined in eqs .
( [ fhnew])([emtnew ] ) are independent of parameters @xmath212 and @xmath294 . hence
, cosmological considerations can not fix the values of these parameters .
it is not surprising , since it is well known ( see @xcite ) that the theories based on the lagrangian ( [ 1.2 ] ) with @xmath295 ( no currents ) can not completely fix the vector field .
condition @xmath171 has been assumed to be valid in cosmology ; nevertheless , this condition is not strictly required by extended electromagnetism .
the question is : what would be a scalar @xmath6-current in cosmology ?
more research about this scalar mode and its meaning is being carried out .
finally , let us discuss in detail the fact that our energy momentum tensor and that found in @xcite have opposite signs .
the possible consequences of this difference deserve special attention .
if the relation @xmath296 is satisfied , our lagrangian ( with @xmath18 ) is identical to that used in @xcite ( including @xmath297 ) . in spite of this
fact , opposite signs appear in the energy momentum tensors . as it is explained in sec .  [ sec-2 ] and summarized in the first paragraph of this section , our sign is obtained from the common lagrangian with right variational calculations based on the true conservation law of the theory .
equation ( 4 ) is actually the conservation law satisfied in extended electromagnetism ; however , if we take @xmath298 , which is not an equation of the theory , but the conservation law of standard electromagnetism , the opposite sign is easily found in the resulting energy momentum tensor .
this sign is not right .    for an arbitrary positive @xmath297 value and for the corresponding negative value @xmath299 , the energy - momentum tensor in @xcite is identical to our energy - momentum tensor
hence , the einstein equations are also indistinguishable for these values of @xmath297 ( positive ) and @xmath18 ( negative ) . however , the field equations of the vector field @xmath4 are different for the same values ; namely , for @xmath299 .    equations
( [ 1.3 ] ) may be written in the form @xmath300 , where @xmath47 , and these field equations are to be compared with the equations @xmath301 appearing in @xcite .
this comparison shows that the terms @xmath302 and @xmath303 which modify the field equations of standard electromagnetis have opposite signs for @xmath299 .
since the resulting @xmath4 field equations are different , distinct predictions seem to be unavoidable in general nonlinear applications of extended electromagnetism .
the discussion of these nonlinear cases is beyong the scope of this paper , where we are concerned with cosmological linear applications of the theory .    actually , both signs lead to the same conclusions for first order perturbations of minkowski and robertson - walker space - times , namely , for the cases considered , e.g. , in @xcite and @xcite .
it is due to the fact that , according to eqs .
( [ coscons ] ) , ( [ eqest ] ) , and  ( [ fe12 ] ) , the signs of @xmath210 and @xmath155 are arbitrary and , consequently , for @xmath299 , these signs may be chosen to make identical the scalar parts of the terms @xmath302 and @xmath303 .
thus , the linearized @xmath4 field equations derived in our paper become equivalent to those of previous papers @xcite .
since the energy momentum tensors are also identical for @xmath299 , the modes of positive energy coincide , and the conclusions of papers @xcite and @xcite ( with @xmath304 ) may be also obtained here for @xmath174 . however , only our signs are right and , in general , only our @xmath4 field equations should be applied in nonlinear cases .

we thank j.a .
morales - lladosa for useful discussion .
since wmap observations strongly suggest that cosmological perturbations are adiabatic , only the case @xmath306 is considered in this section .    for cosmological perturbations evolving outside the effective horizon ( @xmath307 ) ,
the evolution is essentially independent of the microphysics .
this means that the anisotropic stress due to neutrinos may be neglected ( @xmath308 ) , and also that , in spite of the tight coupling between photons and baryons ( see @xcite ) at @xmath309 , the transfer of energy and momentum between these two species may be forgotten and , consequently , the corresponding fluids may be treated as independent .
this means that , for superhorizon scales , a good enough estimate of functions @xmath305 may be done by solving eqs .
( [ fh])([emt ] ) for @xmath310 . in this case ,
( [ fh])([emt ] ) lead to : @xmath311   \psi_{m}=0 \ , \label{emt_app}\ ] ] @xmath312 @xmath313\psi_{m } \ , \label{vs_app}\ ] ] @xmath314 where @xmath315 .
this system of equations must be solved together with the background equations for appropriate initial conditions at @xmath103 .
the background is a flat universe with cosmological constant .
the energy densities of matter , radiation and vacuum correspond to the concordance model ( see above ) .
the background differential equations may be easily integrated to get @xmath203 , @xmath194 , and @xmath195 .
the integration of eqs .
( [ emt_app])([vs_app ] ) only requires @xmath316 and @xmath317 at @xmath217 .
in fact , from the first of these values one easily obtains @xmath318 , and the initial value of @xmath319 may be then obtained by substituting @xmath317 into eq .
( [ vs_app ] ) . the second order differential equation ( [ emt_app ] )
may be integrated by using @xmath318 and @xmath320 .
function @xmath321 is then known and @xmath317 may be used to solve eq .
( [ vs_app ] ) and get function @xmath322 .
since @xmath186 and @xmath323 are gauge invariant quantities , their initial values may be calculated in any gauge .
we have used the synchronous gauge to perform this calculation . for superhorizon scales ,
equation  ( 96 ) of reference @xcite may be used to easily get the following initial conditions : @xmath324 where the conformal time @xmath325 is that corresponding to the chosen initial redshift @xmath103 , @xmath326 is a normalization constant , and the subscripts @xmath18 , @xmath327 , and @xmath328 stand for photons , baryons , and cold dark matter , respectively .
the fluid formed by these three components has the following density contrast and peculiar velocity @xcite : @xmath329/(\rho_{b}+p_{b } )   \ . \label{superp}\end{aligned}\ ] ] the initial values of @xmath330 and @xmath323 may be easily calculated taking into account eqs .
( [ invt ] ) , ( [ init ] ) , and ( [ superp ] ) .
equations .
( [ emt_app])([vs_app ] ) may be then solved .
the estimation of quantities @xmath305 requires normalization .
the question is : how can we find a good enough value of the normalization constant @xmath326 ?
it is well known that , for superhorizon scales , the gauge invariant quantity @xmath331 \label{fseta}\ ] ] is conserved @xcite and , moreover , at horizon crossing , the relation @xmath332 is satisfied , where @xmath333 is a number of order unity ( see @xcite and references cited therein ) .
then , normalization may be achieved as follows : in a first step , the matter power spectrum at present time @xmath334 is obtained , by using cmbfast , for a certain version of the concordance model ( see @xcite for details ) .
the resulting spectrum is represented in fig .
[ figu3 ] . from it
, we can estimate @xmath335 . in a second step , eqs .
( [ emt_app])([vs_app ] ) are numerically solved for the scale @xmath245 and for an arbitrary @xmath326 value and , then , by combining eqs .
( [ em_app ] ) , ( [ ph_app ] ) , and ( [ fseta ] ) , the function @xmath336 may be easily calculated . finally , in a last step
, the value of the normalization constant @xmath326 is fixed .
it is done by using eq .
( [ pre_cont ] ) to calculate @xmath337 , and taken into account that the resulting @xmath337 quantity must be identical to @xmath338 for the right @xmath326 value .    the @xmath337 value obtained from the spectrum of fig .  [ figu3 ] and eq .
( [ pos_mom ] ) may be easily used to estimate the contrast @xmath339 in position space , the resulting value is close to @xmath263 as it is expected for this scale ." ," a certain vector - tensor ( vt ) theory is revisited . 
 it was proposed and analyzed as a theory of electromagnetism without the standard gauge invariance . 
 our attention is first focused on a detailed variational formulation of the theory , which leads to both a modified lorentz force and the true energy momentum tensor of the vector field . the theory is then applied to cosmology . 
 a complete gauge invariant treatment of the scalar perturbations is presented . for appropriate gauge invariant variables describing the scalar modes of the vector field ( a - modes ) 
 , it is proved that the evolution equations of these modes do not involve the scalar modes appearing in general relativity ( gr - modes ) , which are associated to the metric and the energy momentum tensor of the cosmological fluids . however , the a - modes modify the standard gauge invariant equations describing the gr - modes . by using the new formalism , 
 the evolution equations of the a - perturbations are derived and separately solved and , then , the correction terms due to the a - perturbations appearing in the evolution equations of the gr - modes are estimated . 
 the evolution of these correction terms is studied for an appropriate scale . 
 the relevance of these terms depends on both the spectra and the values of the normalization constants involved in extended electromagnetism . 
 further applications of the new formalism will be presented elsewhere . "

the gaussian wavepacket method ( gwm ) is one of such methods whose main aim is a semi - classical description of quantum systems ( for a recent review on gwm , see ref .
if the wavefuction is gaussian at @xmath14 in a ho system , it remains at all @xmath0 .
heller @xcite proposed that even for more realistic potentials , we may adopt a ( thawed ) gaussian wavepacket given by @xmath15 \right ] , \label{eq : a3}\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are time - dependent complex parameters .
heller @xcite derived equations of motion for @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , employing an assumption that the potential expanded in the taylor series at @xmath18 may be truncated by @xmath19 where @xmath20 signifies the @xmath21th derivative of @xmath2 .
the concept of the gaussian wavepacket has been adopted in many fields @xcite .
dynamics is well described by gwm for a ho system where motions of fluctuations are separated from those of @xmath4 and @xmath5 , leading to the uncertainty relation : @xmath22 .
various types of variants of gwm such as the frozen @xcite and generalized gaussian wavepacket methods @xcite have been proposed @xcite . among them , we pay our attention into the time - dependent variational approximation ( tdva ) which employs the normalized squeezed coherent - state gaussian wavepacket given by @xcite @xmath23 , \label{eq : a5}\end{aligned}\ ] ] @xmath24 and @xmath25 being time - dependent parameters . for
the introduced squeezed coherent state , equations of motion given by eq .
( [ eq : a2 ] ) are closed within @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 [ see eqs .
( [ eq : g17])-([eq : g19 ] ) ] .
a comparison between heller s gwm and tdva is made in refs .
@xcite .
there have been many studies on gwm which is applied to ho , anharmonic oscillator ( ao ) and morse potentials @xcite
. however , gwm has some difficulty when applied to a potential @xmath2 including terms of @xmath28 with @xmath29 . although it has been claimed that gwm yields a fairly good result for ao systems @xcite , we wonder whether it actually works for double - well ( dw ) systems .
dw potential models have been employed in a wide range of fields including physics , chemistry and biology ( for a recent review on dw systems , see ref .
lin and ballentine @xcite , and utermann , dittrich and hnggi @xcite studied semi - classical properties of dw systems subjected to periodic external forces , calculating the husimi function @xcite .
their calculations showed a chaotic behavior in accordance with classical driven dw systems .
igarashi and yamada @xcite studied a coherent oscillation and decoherence induced by applied polychromatic forces in quantum dw system . by using tdva , pattanayak and
schieve @xcite pointed out that a chaos is induced by quantum noise in dw systems without external forces although classical counterparts are regular .
this is in contrast to the usual expectation that quantum effects suppress classical chaos .
chaotic - like behavior was reported in a square dw system obtained by the exact calculation @xcite .
quantum chaos pointed out in ref .
@xcite is still controversial @xcite .
quite recently , hasegawa has studied effects of the asymmetry on the specific heat @xcite and tunneling @xcite in the asymmetric dw systems , by using the spectral method ( sm ) in which expansion coefficients are evaluated for energy matrix elements with a finite size of @xmath30 [ eqs .
( [ eq : b7 ] ) and ( [ eq : b8 ] ) ] . model calculations in refs . @xcite have pointed out intrigue phenomena which are in contrast with earlier relevant studies .
it is worthwhile to examine the validity of tdva applied to dw systems with the use of quasi - exact sm @xcite , which is the purpose of the present paper .
such a study has not been reported as far as we are aware of .
it is important to clarify the significance of tdva for dw systems .
the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,
we mention the calculation method employed in our study .
we consider quantum systems described by the symmetric dw ( sdw ) model . in solving dynamics of a gaussian wavepacket in the sdw
, we have adopted the two methods : sm and tdva . in section 3 ,
we report calculated results of the magnitude of wavefunction ( @xmath31 ) , an expectation value of @xmath32 ( @xmath4 ) , the auto - correlation function ( @xmath33 ) and the uncertainty product ( @xmath9@xmath10 ) . in section 4 we apply our method also to an ao model .
section 5 is devoted to our conclusion .
we consider a dw system whose hamiltonian is given by @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 here @xmath36 , @xmath32 and @xmath37 express mass , position and momentum , respectively , of a particle , @xmath2 stands for the dw potential , and @xmath38 is the ho hamiltonian with the oscillator frequency @xmath39 .
the sdw potential @xmath2 has stable minima at @xmath40 and an unstable maximum at @xmath41 with the potential barrier of @xmath42 .
a prefactor of @xmath43 in eq .
( [ eq : h1 ] ) is chosen such that the dw potential @xmath2 has the same curvature at the minima as the ho potential @xmath44 : @xmath45 .
figure [ fig1 ] expresses the adopted quartic dw potential @xmath2 with @xmath46 and @xmath47 in eq .
( [ eq : h1 ] ) .
eigenfunction and eigenvalue for @xmath38 are given by @xmath48 where @xmath49 stands for the @xmath50th hermite polynomial .     and
@xmath47 in eq .
( [ eq : h1 ] ) , dashed curves expressing eigenvalues of @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) .
, width=264 ]      various approximate analytical and numerical methods have been proposed to solve the schrdinger equation given by eq .
( [ eq : a1 ] ) @xcite .
assuming @xmath53 , we first solve the steady - state schrdinger equation , @xmath54 , with the eigenvalue @xmath55 .
the stationary wavefunction @xmath56 is expanded in terms of @xmath57 @xmath58 leading to the secular equation @xmath59 with @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the maximum quantum number .
for the time - dependent state , we adopt sm in which the eigenfunction @xmath1 is expanded in terms of @xmath57 with finite @xmath61 @xmath62 time - dependent expansion coefficients @xmath63 obey equations of motion given by @xmath64 equation ( [ eq : b8 ] ) expresses the ( @xmath65 ) first - order differential equations , which may be solved for given initial conditions of @xmath66 .
initial values of expansion coefficients @xmath66 are determined by @xmath67 for a given gaussian wavepacket @xmath68 [ eq .
( [ eq : a5 ] ) ] @xmath69 , \label{eq : b11}\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are initial position and momentum , respectively , and @xmath72 and @xmath73 are assumed initial parameters at @xmath74 .
once solutions of @xmath63 in eq .
( [ eq : b8 ] ) are obtained , the wavefunction @xmath1 may be constructed by eq .
( [ eq : b7 ] ) .
matrix elements @xmath75 in eq .
( [ eq : b9 ] ) may be analytically evaluated , and various time - dependent averages such as @xmath4 and @xmath5 are expressed in terms of @xmath63 ( see the appendix ) .
we expect that sm with @xmath30 adopted in our numerical calculations is fairly accurate @xcite .
some results of sm have been cross - checked , by solving the schrdinger equation with the use the mathematica resolver for the partial differential equation .
equations of motion in eq .
( [ eq : a2 ] ) are expressed by @xmath76 equations ( [ eq : g1])-([eq : g4 ] ) include higher - order fluctuations which are not closed in general .
it is possible to construct various approximations depending on how many terms are taken into account in eqs .
( [ eq : g1])-([eq : g4 ] ) .
if we neglect the second term of eq .
( [ eq : g2 ] ) , eqs .
( [ eq : g1 ] ) and ( [ eq : g2 ] ) form classical equations of motion . when we neglect the second term in eq .
( [ eq : g2 ] ) and truncate eqs .
( [ eq : g3 ] ) and ( [ eq : g4 ] ) at @xmath77 , eqs .
( [ eq : g1])-([eq : g4 ] ) reduce to equations of motion in heller s gwm .
equations of motion including up to fourth - order corrections were obtained in ref .
@xcite .    to close a hierarchal chain of equations of motion
, tdva assumes that a wavepacket is expressed by the normalized squeezed coherent state given by eq .
( [ eq : a5 ] ) , implying relations @xcite @xmath78 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are time - dependent parameters .
note that eqs .
( [ eq : g12])-([eq : g13b ] ) yield the uncertainty product expressed by @xmath79 these lead to equations of motion given by @xmath80 alternatively , eqs .
( [ eq : g5a])-([eq : g5c ] ) may be rewritten as @xmath81 which show a closure of equations of motion within @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath9 and @xmath82 .
-@xmath37 phase space of the sdw model for various initial energies of @xmath83 , marks @xmath84 denoting positions of initial states adopted in model calculations . ,
width=264 ]    we apply our calculation method to the sdw potential given by eq .
( [ eq : h1 ] ) .
we have calculated energy matrix elements of @xmath85 , by using eq .
( [ eq : h6 ] ) with @xmath86 and @xmath30 . obtained eigenvalues
are @xmath87 0.450203 , 0.474126 , 1.09262 , 1.39334 and 1.91286 for @xmath88 to 4 , respectively , which are plotted by dashed curves in fig .
the ground state ( @xmath89 ) and first excited state ( @xmath90 ) , which are quasi - degenerate , are below the potential barrier of @xmath47 .
the energy gap between ground and first excited states is @xmath91 .
low - lying eigenvalues calculated with @xmath30 are in good agreement with those obtained with @xmath92 @xcite .
figure [ fig2 ] shows the classical @xmath32-@xmath37 phase space for initial energies of @xmath93 , 1.0 and 1.125 .
marks @xmath94 in fig .
[ fig2 ] show two initial states in the @xmath32-@xmath37 phase space adopted in our calculations .
calculated results for the two initial states of @xmath95 and @xmath96 will be separately reported in the following .
we have adopted the gaussian wavepacket @xmath68 locating at the stable point of the left well with @xmath97 , and @xmath98 and @xmath99 at @xmath74 , which yields the minimum uncertainty product of @xmath100 .
initial coefficients @xmath66 calculated by eq . (
[ eq : b10 ] ) are real with appreciable magnitudes for @xmath101 .
a norm of the initial gaussian wavepacket is @xmath102 [ eq . ( [ eq : c2 ] ) ] . after solving ( @xmath65 ) first - order differential equations for @xmath63 given by eq .
( [ eq : b8 ] ) for initial values of @xmath66 , we obtain the time - dependent eigenfunction @xmath1 expressed in terms of @xmath63 in eq .
( [ eq : b7 ] ) .
figure [ fig3 ] shows the 3d plot of @xmath31 calculated by sm .
we note that the gaussian wavepacket in sm quickly spreads as the time develops . in order to scrutinize the behavior of @xmath31 at small @xmath103 , its time dependence at @xmath104
is plotted by bold solid curves in fig .
[ fig4 ] , where solid curves denote results of tdva .
the gaussian wavepacket becomes widespread even at @xmath105 in sm , and its trend becomes more significant with increasing @xmath103 .
figure [ fig4 ] clearly shows that @xmath31 in sm is quite different from that in tdva and that @xmath1 can not be expressed by a single gaussian except at @xmath74 .     as functions of @xmath32 and @xmath103 calculated by sm for the sdw model ( @xmath106 ) .

. note that @xmath110 equals to @xmath109 in tdva [ eq .
( [ eq : g13 ] ) ] , which is not realized in ( a ) and ( b ) . , width=264 ]     of the sdw model calculated by ( a ) sm and ( b ) tdva ( @xmath111 ) .
, width=264 ]    the difference between sm and tdva is more clearly seen in the time - dependent expectation value of @xmath4 .
figure [ fig5](a ) shows @xmath4 of sm expressing a tunneling of a particle with the period of about 260 , which is consistent with the period estimated from the energy gap by @xmath112 . on the contrary , @xmath4 of tdva in fig .
[ fig5](b ) shows more rapid oscillation with a period of about @xmath113 .
figures [ fig6](a ) and [ fig6](b ) show @xmath4 vs. @xmath5 plots calculated by sm and tdva , respectively . the @xmath4 vs. @xmath5 plot of sm in fig .
[ fig6](a ) is quite different from that of tdva in fig .
[ fig6](b ) .
figure [ fig7](a ) shows the uncertain product of @xmath114 calculated by sm , which expresses a measure of quantum fluctuation .
it starts from the minimum uncertainty of @xmath115 at @xmath14 , and with increasing @xmath103 it grows and oscillates between about 5 and 17 with the period of about 130 . for a comparison
, we plot @xmath109 in fig .
[ fig7](b ) .
tdva assumes the equality of @xmath116 as given by eq .
( [ eq : g13 ] ) .
figures [ fig7](a ) and [ fig7](b ) , however , imply that this equality is not satisfied in sm .
figures [ fig8](a ) and [ fig8](b ) show the auto - correlation functions @xmath117 calculated by sm and tdva , respectively , with eq .
( [ eq : c2 ] ) in the appendix .
@xmath117 of sm , which is unity at @xmath74 , oscillates between about 0.1 and 0.7 with a period of about 260 .
the result of sm in fig .
[ fig8](a ) is again quite different from that of tdva in fig . [
fig8](b ) .
next we adopt a gaussian wavepacket with a different initial state of @xmath96 but with the same @xmath98 and @xmath99 at @xmath74 .
initial coefficients @xmath66 calculated by eq .
( [ eq : b10 ] ) are complex with appreciable magnitudes for @xmath119 .
the initial state of @xmath118 locates near a top of the potential barrier ( see fig .
[ fig2 ] ) .
note that in the classical calculation , the @xmath32 vs. @xmath37 plot forms a cocoon shape extending from @xmath120 to @xmath121 and from @xmath122 to 1.5 , as shown in fig .
then at @xmath0 , a particle starting from @xmath96 rolls down the potential up to @xmath121 and then approaches @xmath120 after passing through @xmath123 in the classical calculation .
however , this classical behavior is quite different from quantum results calculated by sm and tdva .
the 3d plot of @xmath31 of sm shown in fig .
[ fig9 ] has appreciable magnitudes at @xmath124 for @xmath125 .
bold solid curves and solid curves in fig .
[ fig10 ] show @xmath31 calculated by sm and tdva , respectively .
@xmath31 of sm , which is distorted and spreads at @xmath0 , is different from the relevant result of tdva .
an expectation value of @xmath4 of sm in fig .
[ fig11](a ) does not so much depart from the initial point of @xmath126 in contrast to that of tdva shown in fig .
[ fig11](b ) .
figures [ fig12](a ) and [ fig12](b ) show @xmath4 vs. @xmath5 plots calculated by sm and tdva , respectively .
the result of sm in fig .
[ fig12](a ) exhibits a random - like motion , which is different from a quasi - periodic motion of tdva in fig . [

we note that @xmath127 in sm , which is in contrast with eq .

note that @xmath129 equals to @xmath109 in tdva [ eq .
( [ eq : g13 ] ) ] , which is not held in sm . ,
refs . @xcite showed that by using a change of variables given by @xmath130 eqs .
( [ eq : g5a])-([eq : g5c ] ) are transformed to @xmath131 it was shown that fluctuation variables @xmath132 and @xmath133 are conjugate and that the effective hamiltonian may be expressed in the extended phase space spanned by @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath132 and @xmath133 as given by @xcite @xmath134 we should note that the effective hamiltonian given by eq .
( [ eq : g25 ] ) relies on the identities given by eqs .
( [ eq : g12])-([eq : g13b ] ) which are based on the assumed squeezed gaussian wavepacket given by eq .
( [ eq : a5 ] ) . if these identities are not held as our sm calculation suggests , the effective hamiltonian given by eq .
( [ eq : g25 ] ) is not valid in dw systems .       as functions of @xmath32 and @xmath103 of the ao model with ( a ) @xmath135 and ( b ) @xmath136 calculated by sm ( @xmath137 ) .

, width=377 ]     in the ao model with @xmath136 calculated by ( a ) sm and ( b ) tdva ( @xmath137 ) .
, width=264 ]    we have studied gaussian wavepacket dynamics of quantum dw systems in the preceding section . it is worthwhile to examine also an ao model given by @xmath143 where @xmath144 expresses a degree of anharmonicity .
we have repeated calculations , by using sm and tdva with necessary modifications .
figure [ fig14](a ) shows the 3d plot of @xmath31 for @xmath135 with an assumed gaussian state for @xmath145 , and @xmath98 and @xmath99 at @xmath74 . in the case of a ho potential ( @xmath146 ) , @xmath31 is periodic with a period of @xmath147 .
it is shown in [ fig14](a ) that @xmath31 for a small @xmath135 is nearly periodic as that for @xmath146 at @xmath148 .
for a larger @xmath136 , however , this periodicity is destroyed and the wavepacket spreads in the non - gaussian form as fig .
[ fig14](b ) shows .
this is more clearly realized in fig .
[ fig15 ] where @xmath31 calculated by sm ( bold solid curves ) are quite different from their counterparts obtained by tdva ( solid curve ) .
our result of sm in fig .
[ fig15 ] is consistent with that in ref .
@xcite which studied effects of anharmonicity and interactions in dw systems .
figures [ fig16](a ) and [ fig16](b ) show time dependences of @xmath4 calculated by sm and tdva , respectively . @xmath4 oscillates with a period of about @xmath149 in both results .
however , a period of its envelope variation in sm ( @xmath150 ) is larger than that in tdva ( @xmath151 ) : the former corresponds to the revival time after which a wavepacket periodically returns to the initial shape .
by using sm and tdva , we have calculated time dependences of wavefunctions , averages of position and momentum , auto - correlation function , and uncertainty product in quantum sdw systems .
the validity of tdva has been examined by comparisons between results of sm and tdva .
we have obtained following results :    \(1 ) an initial gaussian wavepacket in dw systems of sm spreads and deforms at @xmath0 where a wavepacket can not be expressed by a single gaussian in contrast to tdva ,    \(2 ) time dependences of expectation values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and the auto - correlation function in sm are quite different from their counterparts in tdva , and    \(3 ) the identity relation for uncertainty product assumed in tdva [ eq .
( [ eq : g13 ] ) ] is not satisfied in sm .
the item ( 1 ) holds also in asymmetric dw systems @xcite .
the item ( 2 ) implies that the tunneling phenomenon characteristic in dw systems can not be well accounted for in tdva ( fig .
[ fig5 ] ) @xcite .
the item ( 3 ) suggests that the effective hamiltonian in the extended phase space given by eq .
( [ eq : g25 ] ) does not hold in dw systems because it is derived with the squeezed gaussian wavepacket with assumptions given by eqs .
( [ eq : g12])-([eq : g13b ] ) in tdva .
gwm is best applied to dynamics in ho and ao with a small anharmonicity , for which it provides us with an efficient and physically - transparent calculation method .
our calculations , however , point out that gwm is not a good approximation for dw systems . for a better description of quantum dw systems , it might be necessary to adopt extended gwms with superimposed multiple gaussian wavepackets ( see ref .
@xcite , related references therein ) , which are much sophisticated and complicated than the original heller s gwm @xcite .

\label{eq : c3b}\end{aligned}\ ] ]" ," we have examined the validity of the time - dependent variational approximation ( tdva ) to the gaussian wavepacket method ( gwm ) for quantum double - well ( dw ) systems , by using the quasi - exact spectral method ( sm ) . 
 comparisons between results of wavefunctions , averages of position and momentum , the auto - correlation function , and an uncertainty product calculated by sm and tdva have been made . 
 it has been shown that a given initial gaussian wavepacket in sm is quickly deformed at @xmath0 where a wavepacket can not be expressed by a _ single _ 
 gaussian , and that assumptions on averages of higher - order fluctuations in tdva are not justified . 
 these results cast some doubt on an application of tdva to dw systems . 
 gaussian wavepacket dynamics in anharmonic potential systems is studied also .

"most relaxed galaxy clusters possess a cool - core where , in the absence of heating , rapid radiative cooling should lead to a classical cooling flow of hundreds to a thousand solar masses per year @xcite .
however , x - ray observations by chandra and xmm - newton reveal a lack of cooler x - ray gas below 1 - 2 kev that is expected in the static cooling flow model @xcite .
in addition , the observed star formation rate is usually much lower than the classical rate @xcite .
the absence of observational support for a classical cooling flow ( the `` cooling flow problem '' ) suggests the presence of some heating source(s ) to offset radiative cooling .
it is now generally accepted that agn feedback plays a major role in preventing a classical cooling flow @xcite .
however , exactly how agn deposits its energy into the intra - cluster medium ( icm ) is still unclear .
observationally , different ways of analyzing and interpreting the x - ray data have resulted in different answers to what is the major heating mechanism .
most cool - core clusters are seen to harbor x - ray cavities , which are interpreted to be agn inflated bubbles filled with relativistic plasma and/or very hot thermal gas that are estimated to be energetically sufficient to offset radiative cooling in almost all systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?
* ; * ? ? ?
these bubbles contain abundant energy @xcite which can be directly mixed into the icm , or drive shock waves , sound waves and turbulence as they rise @xcite . by estimating the frequency and strength of the weak shocks in the core of the perseus cluster , @xcite and @xcite
conclude that the dissipation of shock waves can offset cooling .
on the other hand , @xcite extracts velocity spectra from the observed density fluctuations , and finds that the dissipation of turbulence can balance radiative cooling locally at each radius within the cores of perseus and virgo .
numerical simulations and calculations have also explored a wide range of ways in which agn heats the icm , such as diffusion and/or streaming of cosmic rays @xcite , viscous dissipation of sound waves @xcite , turbulent dissipation mediated by magnetic fields and plasma instabilities @xcite , hot bubbles + circulation flows @xcite , and bubble mixing @xcite . in recent years , momentum - driven agn jets powered by cold mode accretion have achieved great success in reproducing many observed properties of cool - core clusters @xcite , including globally suppressed cooling rate , spatially extended multiphase gas that resembles the observed h@xmath0 filaments @xcite , weak shock waves and cavities behind shock waves , while maintaining a cool - core appearance . in addition , @xcite showed that star formation and stellar feedback can regulate the long term agn cycles , causing the cluster core to experience semi - periodic bursts of precipitation , star formation and agn outbursts , which naturally explains the variety of morphologies of star forming structures observed in nearby brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) and star formation rates @xcite .
interestingly , contrary to @xcite , numerical simulations of explosive agn - like events in @xcite are inefficient in driving turbulence .
similarly , @xcite also concludes that turbulence is not the main source of heating in idealized simulations with momentum - driven agn feedback . how do we reconcile simulations with observations and understand different interpretations of observations ?    in this paper ,
using a novel method , we analyze the standard simulation in @xcite where radiative cooling is balanced by momentum - driven agn feedback in a time averaged sense in an isolated , idealized perseus - like cluster .
we compute the dissipative heating rate ( the rate at which kinetic energy is dissipated into thermal energy ) , and separate it into shock dissipation and turbulent dissipation .
we calculate the amount of heating due to different physical processes as a function of radius at different times .
the key questions we try to address in this paper include : ( 1 ) how much energy is dissipated via shocks and turbulence ? ( 2 ) how does the energy dissipation change with radius and time as the cluster core goes through cycles of agn outbursts ? ( 3 ) do simulations agree with observations on the amount of turbulent heating in cluster cores ? ( 4 ) how do we reconcile the different interpretations of observations ?    the paper is structured as follows : in section  [ sec : method ] , we describe the methodology including the simulation setup , the methods that we use to calculate dissipative heating rate and to separate shock dissipation and turbulent dissipation ; in section  [ sec : results ] , we present the results of the simulation analysis , and show how cooling and heating change as a function of time and radius ; in section  [ sec : discussion_1 ] and section  [ sec : discussion_2 ] , we discuss how our results compare with the other theoretical works and the observations . in section  [ sec : discussion_3 ] , we discuss the uncertainties of our analysis and the limitations of momentum - driven agn feedback model , and in section  [ sec : discussion_4 ] we discuss the implication of our results .
we summarize this work in section  [ conclusions ] .
the simulation analyzed in this paper is the standard run in @xcite which has a detailed description of the simulation setup .
here we only reiterate the key aspects .
the simulation is performed with the three dimensional adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) code enzo @xcite .
the hydrodynamic method is the zeus method @xcite which we will discuss more in section  [ sec : method_2 ] .
the resolution ( smallest cell size ) of the simulation is @xmath1 pc with a box size of 16 mpc and a maximum refinement level of 10 .
the initial gas density and temperature are based on the observations of the perseus cluster @xcite .
we adopt the ideal gas law with an adiabatic index of @xmath2 , and assume that the icm is initially in hydrostatic equilibrium with the gravitational potential , which includes four components : the icm itself , the smbh with @xmath3 @xcite , the perseus bcg ngc 1275 @xcite , and an navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) dark matter halo @xcite with @xmath4 and the scale radius @xmath5 kpc .
we model the momentum - driven agn feedback with a pair of jets ( collimated bipolar outflows ) launched along the z - axis from two parallel planes @xcite , powered by cold mode accretion , the rate of which is estimated by dividing the total amount of cold gas within the accretion zone of @xmath6 pc by a typical accretion time of 5 myr .
the jets are mass loaded such that the total outflow rate from the two jets is equal to the accretion rate @xmath7 .
the jet power is @xmath8 where we use a feedback efficiency @xmath9 , and assume that half of the energy is thermalized at the jet launching planes . with these parameters , the jet velocity is @xmath10 km @xmath11 .
we also adopt a small angle precession ( @xmath12 ) with a 10 myr period to avoid low density channels and increase the area that the jets directly impact ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .
the other important physical processes included in the simulations are radiative cooling , self gravity of the icm , and star formation and stellar feedback .
we adopt the radiative cooling curve used in @xcite for half - solar metallicity gas @xcite with a temperature floor at 300 k. star formation is modeled based the criteria described in @xcite .
a star particle is formed when the gas density exceeds a threshold ( @xmath13 in this simulation ) , and the cell is jeans unstable with a convergent flow and a cooling time shorter than the local dynamical time .
thermal feedback from star particles is also included . though as discussed in @xcite , stellar feedback has little impact on the results because its power is orders of magnitudes lower than that of agn feedback in a cluster .
one main goal of this work is to study how mechanical energy of the jets is dissipated into heat .
we chose the zeus @xcite hydrodynamic method for the simulation , which uses a von neumann - richtmyer artificial viscosity , enabling us to calculate the rate at which kinetic energy is dissipated in the simulations .
the details of the zeus method can be found in @xcite .
we only present the key formula that is relevant to the calculation .
zeus method employs an artificial viscous pressure to smooth shock discontinuities :    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is a constant that determines the strength of the viscosity , and is set to be @xmath16 in the simulation with @xmath17 being the cell width . at every time step of the simulation , where the condition @xmath18 is met
, a viscous heating term @xmath19 is added to the energy equation , which is the kinetic energy that is converted into thermal energy locally .
we show how this method works in a test simulation in the appendix .
the method described in section  [ sec : method_2 ] allows us to compute the total dissipative heating rate within each cell at each time step .
we then separate shock heating and turbulent heating by identifying the cells that harbor shock waves .
various methods have been used in the literature ( e.g. * ? ? ?
* ; * ? ? ?
* ) to identify shock waves based on the jump conditions .
we adopt the shock finding method used in the enzo refinement criteria .
a cell is flagged to contain shocks if all of the following conditions are met : ( 1 ) @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the maximum pressure jump across any interface of that cell .
@xmath22 is a small positive value to ensure that pressure increases after the shock .
we set @xmath23 which corresponds to a mach number of @xmath24 .
our results are not sensitive to the exact value of @xmath22 as we discuss in section  [ sec : discussion_3 ] .
( 2 ) @xmath25 , i.e. , the flow is converging .
( 3 ) the thermal energy to total energy ratio within the cell @xmath26 .
we have also experimented using a temperature criterion that requires the gradients of gas temperature and entropy to have the same sign @xcite , and find little difference in the results .
after we flag all the cells that have shocks , we assume that the flagged cells are dissipating kinetic energy via shock waves , whereas the rest of the cells that are dissipating kinetic energy are doing so via turbulence . because turbulence can also exist in cells that have shocks ,
the amount of turbulence is likely underestimated , but since the volume filling fraction of shock waves is rather low compared with turbulence , the amount of turbulence that is unaccounted for should be very small .
figure  [ fig : slice ] shows the dissipative heating rate and the mach number of the shock waves in a slice of gas through the center of the cluster along the y - z plane at @xmath27 gyr .
note that only gas at @xmath28 kpc ( roughly the cooling radius of the cluster ) is shown .
we also excluded star forming regions to avoid contamination by selecting only gas with temperatures higher than @xmath29 and densities lower than @xmath30 .
the cluster experiences three cooling - agn outburst cycles within @xmath31 gyr .
the details of the interplay between icm cooling , agn feedback , and star formation are described in @xcite with a focus on the role of star formation and stellar feedback . in this section ,
we examine the battle between radiative cooling and agn heating .
the top panel of figure  [ fig : combine2 ] shows the evolution of the agn jet power , along with the icm cooling rate , the total dissipative heating rate , shock heating rate and turbulent heating rate within @xmath28 kpc . the jet power and
all the heating rates show very large variations on short timescales ( the semitransparent lines show the original data for the shock heating rate and the turbulent heating rate ) . for clarity
, we only plot the time averaged jet power and the total dissipative heating rate .    at the beginning of each cycle , right before agn feedback is triggered , there is no heating , and therefore the icm cooling rate increases as the cluster core becomes cooler , trying to form a classical cooling flow .
as soon as global cooling happens at the very center of the cluster , the cold - mode accretion turns on agn jets , which quickly trigger more icm to precipitate as the jets dredge out low entropy gas to larger radii @xcite .
the cold gas that condenses out of this non - linear thermal instability partially forms stars and partially falls onto the smbh , boosting its feedback power .
the jet power drastically increases due to this short period of stimulated precipitation ( `` positive agn feedback '' ) , and goes hand - in - hand with the shock dissipative rate , followed by turbulent dissipation with a delay of about 100 myr . within @xmath32 myr , the agn power reaches its peak .
the icm cooling rate peaks before that and begins to decrease as agn heating ( `` negative agn feedback '' ) starts to take effect .
after the agn outburst ( accompanied by a burst of star formation ) , heating continues to dominate cooling .
the reduced cooling rate causes a gradual decline in the agn power . towards the end of the cycle ,
as star formation eventually consumes all the cold gas , taking away the fuel for the smbh , agn feedback is shut off . the jet power and
all the heating rates go to zero , allowing the icm cooling rate to increase again and the system to enter the next cycle .
the shock heating rate is almost an order of magnitude higher than the turbulent heating rate , and is therefore very close to the total dissipative heating rate .
the turbulent heating rate is almost always below the cooling rate except during agn outbursts , which we will discuss more in section  [ sec : discussion_1 ] and  [ sec : discussion_2 ] .
the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : combine2 ] shows the cumulative energy output from the agn , and different heating processes , along with the cumulative energy loss due to radiative cooling within @xmath28 kpc . at the end of the simulation ,
the total energy output from the agn is @xmath33 erg , about @xmath34 of which is dissipated via shock waves , and @xmath35 via turbulence .
the rest @xmath36 is dissipated outside of the @xmath37 kpc core region .
not all of the thermal energy is confined within @xmath38 kpc either .
the total energy loss due to radiative cooling is @xmath39 erg , only @xmath40 of the thermal energy that is generated by the agn jets within @xmath37 kpc . given that the core roughly returns to its original state at the end of the simulation , @xmath41 of the thermal energy is transported to @xmath42 kpc .
although the absolute amount of shock and turbulent dissipation correlates with agn cycles ( figure  [ fig : combine2 ] ) ; the relative amount of heating due to weak shocks vs. turbulence does not appear to correlate with the cycles in an obvious way as shown in figure  [ fig : turb_fraction ] .
the fraction of turbulent dissipation within @xmath38 kpc varies from 5% up to 40% . although some peaks appear to follow major agn outbursts ( e.g. the first peak at around 1 gyr ) , most of them do not .
the lack of a clear correlation is likely because the relative importance of turbulent dissipation can be affected by the interaction between agn jets and cold clouds , which is stochastic .
figure  [ fig : all_average_r ] further shows the imperfection of agn heating : less than @xmath43 of the total jet energy is dissipated within the core , and the amount of energy that is dissipated far exceeds what is required to perfectly balance the radiative cooling loss .
the coupling of the agn jets to the icm is not perfect .
thus in order to suppress cooling flows , the smbh needs to inject a few times more energy than what is needed to offset cooling .
kpc ( solid blue line ) as a function of time , along with the jet power ( solid black at the top ) smoothed with a moving window of 200 myr , the smoothed total dissipative heating rate ( dotted red line ) , the smoothed shock dissipation rate ( solid green line ) and the turbulent dissipation rate ( solid purple line at the bottom ) .
the original un - smoothed data are shown in semi - transparent colors for shock heating and turbulent heating .
bottom : the total cumulative energy loss within @xmath38 kpc due to radiative cooling as a function of time , compared with the total energy output from the agn , and the total energy dissipated within @xmath38 kpc , which has two components  shock heating ( green ) and turbulent heating ( purple ) .
[ fig : combine2 ] ]     kpc as a function of time .
[ fig : turb_fraction ] ]    ]    even within the core , radiative cooling is not perfectly balanced by the local dissipative heating at every radius .
figure  [ fig : mean_r ] shows cooling and heating rates as a function of radius averaged over the whole duration of the simulation ( top panel ) and at three representative times ( bottom three panels ) .
the dissipative heating rates decrease quickly with radius , roughly with a power law slope of @xmath44 , compared with the cooling rate which has a shallower slope of @xmath45 within @xmath46 kpc .
there is more dissipative heating than radiative cooling within @xmath47 kpc , and less at larger radii , indicating that radial heat transportation is important .
+    to compute the rate at which heat is transported radially , we divide the cluster core into 40 spherical shells . within each shell
, the change in the total internal energy follows    @xmath48    where @xmath49 is the radiative cooling rate , and @xmath50 is the dissipative heating rate which includes shock heating and turbulent heating that are discussed previously . the second term on the left hand side of the equation , @xmath51 , is the advection of heat ( radial mixing ) .
the last term @xmath52 is adiabatic processes ( expansion and compression ) .
because of the cyclical behavior of the cluster , the cumulative effect of adiabatic processes is negligible
. therefore , averaged over time , the radial mixing rate within each shell can be estimated as : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the time interval between two simulation outputs and @xmath55 is the change in thermal energy in that shell within @xmath54 .
the average mixing rate is plotted as the black line in the top panel of figure  [ fig : mean_r ] .
the dotted part denotes the negation of the rate , which almost overlaps with the total dissipative heating rate in the innermost core region ( @xmath56 kpc ) .
this means that most of the heat dissipated within @xmath56 kpc is transported outwards , and only a small fraction is used to offset radiative cooling .    even though the average effect of adiabatic processes is small , at individual time steps
, the change of local thermal energy due to adiabatic expansion / compression can be quite significant ( bottom panels of figure  [ fig : mean_r ] ) , often even more than radial mixing .
the adiabatic processes and radial mixing of heat can be intuitively understood by examining the evolution of gas temperature in the central region of the cluster : https://vimeo.com/117832510 .
figure  [ fig : tproj ] shows one snapshot at @xmath57 gyr , when the cluster is entering the second cycle of agn outburst .
following agn - driven shock waves , pockets of hot gas ( low density bubbles ) are being transported outwards due to both buoyancy and the positive radial post - shock velocity .
these bubbles push the surrounding gas ( adiabatic processes ) and also mix with it .
figure  [ fig : mean_r ] shows that even though most of the energy is dissipated via shock waves , the importance of turbulent dissipation increase with radius . this can be seen more clearly in figure  [ fig : heatingfraction ] which shows the fractional contribution from different processes to the total dissipative heating as a function of radius .
turbulent heating increases from @xmath58 to almost @xmath59 at @xmath60 kpc . when we further divide shock waves in two groups based on their mach numbers , we find that even though most of the shock waves are very weak with mach numbers smaller than 1.1 , a significant fraction of the energy is dissipated via stronger shocks with mach numbers larger than 1.1 ( see figure  [ fig : slice ] ) .
these stronger shock waves dissipate more quickly as one would expect .
the left panel of figure  [ fig : mach ] further shows that most shock waves have mach numbers below 1.2 - 1.3 . at radii larger than a few tens of kpc , shocks with
mach numbers higher than 1.5 are extremely rare .
though as the right panel of figure  [ fig : mach ] shows , even though weak shocks are abundant , the contribution to dissipative heating from strong shocks at small radii is significant .
in this section , we first compare our results with other theoretical and numerical works in section  [ sec : discussion_1 ] .
we then compare the turbulent heating rate in the simulations with the observations in section  [ sec : discussion_2 ] , where we also compare our simulations with the hitomi observations of perseus . in section
[ sec : discussion_3 ] , we discuss the limitations of our model and in section  [ sec : discussion_4 ] , the implications of our analysis .      heating
cool - core clusters with weak shock waves has been extensively discussed in the literature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?
* ; * ? ? ?
* ; * ? ? ?
* ; * ? ? ?
* ; * ? ? ?
all of these works generally agree that shock heating can be energetically sufficient to offset cooling . by analyzing the ripples observed in the core of the perseus cluster , @xcite and @xcite
conclude that heating from weak shocks and sounds waves can balance cooling .
similarly , @xcite finds that shock heating can provide enough energy by measuring the typical strength and separation of shock waves seen in the simulations .    however , shock heating has a steeper radial profile than cooling as is shown in figure  [ fig : mean_r ] .
@xcite provides an analytical expression for the dissipation rate of weak shocks as a function of radius and thermal properties of the icm ( which are also functions of radius ) ( see equation 20 of the paper ) . for the density and temperature profiles of perseus
, they estimate that at about @xmath61 kpc , the heating rate @xmath62 , in excellent agreement with the slope we find in our simulation ( @xmath63 , see section  [ sec : results ] and figure  [ fig : mean_r ] ) . using 1d calculations
, @xcite shows that shock waves can deposit too much energy near the center of the cluster , causing the temperature of the icm to rise far above the observations .
they argue that this can be avoided when circulation flows are considered @xcite .
a similar idea is explored in @xcite which essentially describes what is seen in our simulations : the inner parts of the cluster core @xmath64 kpc is shock heated by intermittent agn outbursts ; the outer parts of the cluster core , where shock waves have decayed , are heated by buoyant bubbles ; between heating episodes , the core relaxes towards an asymptotic pure cooling profile .
the importance of bubble heating is also discussed in @xcite .
our simulation setup is very similar to @xcite with momentum - driven agn jets in an idealized cool - core cluster .
the main difference between the two simulations is the treatment of cold gas that condenses out of the icm . in @xcite , cold gas
is replaced by passive particles and is assumed to be all accreted onto the smbh .
the system quickly settles to a quasi - steady state , where agn heats and pushes the gas within the jet cones , and the ambient gas returns in a reduced cooling flow , forming a circulation . in our simulation , cold gas
is preserved and is allowed to form stars . as a result ,
in addition to short time variabilities , agn also undergoes gyr timescale cycles regulated by itself and star formation .
another effect of the cold gas is that it can block and redirect the agn jet material , changing the outflow direction stochastically , and thus causing the heating to happen in a more isotropic fashion ( see @xcite and figure  [ fig : tproj ] ) .
although our simulation does not always have an ordered circulation flow , we find that mixing and adiabatic processes are very important in redistributing the energy from the agn , in agreement with @xcite .
one important conclusion in @xcite is that turbulent heating is unimportant in the simulation because the total energy in turbulence is small compared with thermal energy .
this is in agreement with @xcite which , by decomposing the velocity field , finds that agn is inefficient in driving turbulence and less than @xmath65 of the injected energy ends up in the turbulence . in our simulations , about @xmath35 of the energy is dissipated via turbulence .
agn jets seem more efficient in driving turbulence in our simulations , likely due to the different treatment of the cold gas discussed earlier , which results in a randomization of the jet direction instead of a more steady , ordered `` circulation '' in @xcite .
nonetheless , in agreement with other simulations , our results also suggests that turbulent dissipation is far from the dominant heating mechanism .
thus numerical simulations appear to contradict @xcite which finds that turbulent heating can compensate for radiative cooling at every radius within the cores of perseus and virgo .
gyr . hot bubbles ( pockets of shock heated gas ) are moving outwards behind shock waves , transporting the thermal energy dissipated at small radii to larger distances , some of which is transported beyond @xmath37 kcp along with a fraction of the jet energy that is still in the kinetic form .
[ fig : tproj ] ]    ]          in this section , we discuss how the simulation results compare with the observations .
we focus on the amount of turbulent dissipation vs. radiative cooling in section  [ sec : discussion_2a ] . in section
[ sec : discussion_2b ] , we discuss the velocities of the icm in comparison with the hitomi observations of perseus @xcite , and in particular , why our weak shocks do not contribute much to the line broadening .      to understand the conflict between the observations and numerical simulations on turbulent heating , we compare the amount of heating and cooling in the simulation at every radius , similar to @xcite .
we divide the cluster core into 40 shells and plot the radiative cooling rate against turbulent heating and shock heating rates within each shell in figure  [ fig : yuan ] for t=0.88 gyr .
the blue solid line shows the 1:1 ratio . above @xmath66
, the squares closely follow the blue line , suggesting that turbulent heating can roughly balance cooling within every shell except in the outer core region .
however , figure  [ fig : yuan ] also shows that although there is enough heating from turbulence dissipation , there is yet more from shock wave dissipation .
meanwhile , as the bottom left panel of figure  [ fig : mean_r ] shows , even more heat is transported radially .
in fact , at @xmath27 gyr , the total dissipative heating rate exceeds the radiative cooling rate ( see figure  [ fig : combine2 ] ) : the cluster core is being over - heated .
indeed , as figure  [ fig : combine2 ] and  [ fig : mean_r ] show , the cluster is not in a steady state where agn heating perfectly balances radiative cooling .
rather , the cluster core is over - heated following each agn outburst , and is under - heated at the very beginning and the end of each cycle . according to our model ,
when the cluster is over heated , it usually has extended multi - phase gas , enhanced star formation and agn activities ( although the agn radio power may not be particularly high observationally due to the large temporal variation of cold mode accretion onto the smbh ) . whereas , an under - heated cluster core is typically seen with low agn power and not much cold gas or star formation activities .
the perseus cluster has extended multi - phase gas ( e.g. , * ? ? ?
* ) , a strong nuclear x - ray source with @xmath67 kev @xcite and a rather high far - infrared sfr of @xmath68 @xcite .
therefore , it is likely to be in the evolutionary stage when heating overwhelms cooling , and thus the seemingly conflicting claims based on the observations of perseus can be reconciled : there is indeed enough energy from the dissipation of turbulence @xcite or shock waves alone @xcite to offset cooling , and there is also abundant ( possibly even more ) energy in the hot bubbles @xcite .
all heating processes exist at the same time and over - heat the cluster core .
some of the thermal energy escapes the inner core region , while some increases the core entropy , which slows down precipitation and causes the average agn power to decline .
gradually , heating loses to cooling , causing the core entropy to decrease .
the core relaxes towards a classical cooling flow , and eventually , global catastrophic cooling in the center of the cluster occurs , and triggers another agn outburst .
the hitomi x - ray observatory recently took high - resolution spectra of the perseus core , and the line widths show a rather low line - of - sight velocity dispersion of @xmath69 in a region @xmath70 kpc from the central nucleus , suggesting a `` quiescent icm '' @xcite .
this is in concordance with our simulations where turbulent dissipation is not significant .
we also argue that even though shock waves are the main channel to dissipating kinetic energy in our simulations , they may not contribute much to the line broadening .
the reasons are : ( i ) strong shocks that provide most of the heating can be concealed because there are only a few of them ( figure  [ fig : mach ] ) .
they are not volume filling , and the line emission from them is `` buried '' by the emission from the slower gas located in between them .
( ii ) weak shocks do not broaden the lines significantly because the associated line shifts are much smaller than the sound speed @xmath71 .
for weak shocks , the post - shock velocity in the shock frame is @xmath72 , where @xmath73 , and @xmath74 .
thus to first odder accuracy , the post - shock velocity that causes the line shift in the observer s frame is @xmath75 most shock waves in the simulation have a mach number of @xmath76 or smaller . for @xmath76 and @xmath77 km
/ s , @xmath78 , which is consistent with the hitomi data .
the left panel of figure  [ fig : hitomi ] shows the distribution of the average line - of - sight velocities measured along the x - axis in the simulation at t=0.88 gyr .
the region is selected to be a cylinder of radius 60 kpc with the central 30 kpc cut out to compare with the hitomi observations , which is a region @xmath70 kpc from the central nucleus . even though shock heating and turbulent dissipation are over - heating the cluster core at this moment , most of the gas has velocities lower than 200 km / s .
the right panel shows the distribution of the velocity dispersion along individual lines of sight .
most area has line - of - sight velocity dispersions around @xmath79 km / s .
we plan to compare with the hitomi observations in more detail in future work ( preliminary results confirm consistency ) .    .
the dotted line denotes the 1:1 ratio .
turbulent heating and radiative cooling seem well balanced , in agreement with the observations of perseus and virgo @xcite , but at the same time , there is even more dissipative heating from shock waves ( green circles ) .
[ fig : yuan ] ]          in this section , we first discuss the limitations of our model , including the uncertainties of the analysis , and the limitation due to important physical processes that are not considered in the simulations .
lastly we discuss the implications of our results .
one of the main uncertainties in our analysis comes from the conservation of energy when using zeus method . because zeus follows only the thermal energy , not the total energy ,
the total energy may not be conserved .
as we show in the appendix , energy loss can be as high as ( @xmath80 ) in a low resolution test of decaying turbulence with fixed grids and high mach numbers . because the simulation analyzed in this paper uses amr and the mach numbers are typically rather low ( @xmath81 , see figure  [ fig : mach ] )
, the energy loss is likely less severe .
the fact that the sum of shock and turbulence losses within @xmath38 kpc are close to the energy input is telling us that energy non - conservation is unlikely to be a big effect here ( figure  [ fig : combine2 ] and figure  [ fig : all_average_r ] ) . the effect of energy non - conservation in the simulation is equivalent to a slightly enhanced cooling rate , and results in a slightly higher burden on the agn .
however , we note that because of the energy loss , the feedback energy that escapes beyond @xmath37 kpc in the simulation may be slightly lower than what is inferred in our analysis .
future work should address this , for example , by comparing simulations with zeus and other energy - conserving methods .
another uncertainty comes from how we distinguish shock waves and turbulent motion .
we use @xmath23 in shock identification , which corresponds to an extremely low mach number of @xmath24 . to test how sensitive our results are to the choice of this parameter
, we analyze the simulation data using @xmath82 , corresponding to a mach number of @xmath83 .
we find that the total energy dissipated by shockwaves within @xmath38 kpc only changes by @xmath84 .
in other words , extremely weak shock waves with mach numbers of 1.001 - 1.01 only dissipate 1% of the total energy .
this is in line with our results in section  [ sec : results ] showing that weaker shocks are less effective at dissipating energy ( figure  [ fig : heatingfraction ] and figure  [ fig : mach ] ) even though they are abundant in the simulation .
the results in this paper come from agn feedback modeled using pure hydrodynamic simulations . like the other pure hydro simulations with momentum - driven agn feedback , the bubbles / cavities here are filled with non - relativistic gas that is shock heated by the fast moving agn jets . in reality , the shocks are likely driven by the expansion of the bubbles that contain relativistic plasma .
the mass loaded jets in simulations do slow down very quickly . at a few kpc to a few tens of kpc ,
the typical mach numbers of the shocks are @xmath85 ( figure  [ fig : slice ] , see also @xcite ) , generally consistent with the weak shocks observed in nearby clusters @xcite .
however , the hot bubbles in the hydro simulations usually lack the smooth spherical shape and break easily whereas the observed bubbles appear to be longer lived .
the solution may be adding viscosity @xcite or magnetic fields @xcite to the simulations .
in addition , cluster weather due to mergers and sloshing ( e.g. * ? ? ?
* ) may source turbulent motion or even facilitate precipitation , and these effects are not included in the idealized simulations here .      despite the lack of physical processes discussed previously
, our model seems to produce results that are in general agreement with the observations in terms of the amount of shock heating and turbulent heating : turbulence may sometimes generate a considerable amount of heating compared with cooling @xcite , but turbulent heating is almost always subdominant compared with shock heating . even though the exact duration and strength of each agn cycle may be sensitive to the simulation parameters such as the star formation efficiency and the modeling of stellar feedback , the cyclical behavior itself is robust .
this explains why in some cool - core clusters , agn feedback appears insufficient , such as abell 2029 @xcite , while some other clusters are observed to be heating dominated ( e.g. * ? ? ?
additionally , a considerable fraction of the energy ( both thermal and kinetic ) can escape the innermost core region during the peak of the heating dominant phase in our model , which corresponds to clusters like hydra @xcite .
note that even though the jet power and the heating rates show large swings with time ( figure  [ fig : combine2 ] ) , the radiative cooling rate of the icm exhibits much more subtle variations .
we also emphasize that within each cycle , the agn power also varies on very short timescales , which is found in other similar numerical studies as well@xcite .
therefore , the instantaneous radio power of the agn may not be a good indicator of the feedback strength .
the success of momentum - driven agn feedback model in quenching cooling flows in galaxy cluster may not come as a surprise .
after all , the cluster potential is rather deep , and even if the coupling of the jet energy to the icm is not perfect ( figure  [ fig : all_average_r ] ) , the self - regulating nature of agn feedback allows the smbh to inject enough energy to offset both the radiative cooling loss and the loss of energy outside of the cool core .
to further test the model , simulations that follow the metallicity distribution self consistently may be needed @xcite .
more constraints can be put on the model by studying smaller systems with shallower potential @xcite . in addition
, we will create mock x - ray observations of the simulated cluster and carry out a systematic comparison between simulations and observations in terms of the scale and nature of the fluctuations .
we analyze how agn deposits its energy to the icm in a simulation where momentum - driven agn feedback dynamically balances radiative cooling over 6.5 gyr in an idealized cool - core cluster .
we compute the dissipative heating rate due to the artificial viscosity in the zeus hydro method , and separate shock heating from turbulent heating by identifying shock waves .
we analyze how radiative cooling , dissipative heating and heating / cooling due to adiabatic processes change with time and radius .
we compare the amount of cooling and heating at different radii to understand the balance between cooling and heating .
our main conclusions are :    \1 . within the inner core region ( @xmath38 kpc ) , on average , energy dissipation via shock waves is almost an order of magnitude higher than that via turbulence in the simulation .
most of the shock waves are weak shocks with typical mach numbers @xmath86 .
thus the velocities of the icm in the simulation are in concordance with the hitomi observations of perseus .
shock dissipation is a steep function of radius , with most of the energy dissipated within @xmath87 kpc , while turbulent dissipation shows a more gradual decline with radius .
radial transportation of heat ( radial mixing and adiabatic processes ) is important as the post shock materials ( hot bubbles ) rise and distribute the thermal energy throughout the core .
dissipative heating itself does not perfectly balance radiative cooling loss spatially or temporally .
some of the jet energy is dissipated outside the cool core , and a considerable fraction ( more than half ) of the dissipated energy is transported beyond @xmath42 kpc on average , while less than half of the thermal energy is actually used to offset radiative cooling loss within the core . as the cluster experiences cycles of agn outbursts regulated by the interplay between icm cooling , star formation and the agn itself on gyr timescales , the cluster core undergoes phases of temporary over heating and over cooling .
\3 . during the over heating period
, sometimes the amount of turbulent dissipation may appear to balance radiative cooling perfectly .
however , at the same time , more heat is dissipated vis shock waves and being radially mixed .
thus turbulent heating alone can be enough , but when it is enough , shock dissipation is unavoidably over heating the cluster core .
different interpretations of the x - ray observations of perseus have resulted in different claims regarding what is the heating mechanism .
we find that the perseus cluster has the characteristics of the over heating phase in our model , with extended multiphase gas and enhanced agn and star formation activities .
therefore , shock dissipation , turbulent dissipation and bubble mixing can all balance cooling , and are all operating at the same time , temporarily over heating the core of perseus .

the simulation data is analyzed using the publicly available yt visualization package @xcite .

we analyze a clean , simple simulation to test the method that is used to calculate the dissipative heating rate .
the simulation is based on the standard test driven turbulence 3d which comes with the standard enzo2.5 ( http://enzo-project.org ) .
we use all the standard parameters except that we change the hydro method to zeus method , which automatically turns off driving .
thus we are only simulating the decay of supersonic turbulence ( with a @xmath88 spectrum ) .
the simulation box has a size of @xmath89 with 32 fixed grids ( no amr ) in each dimension and periodic boundaries .
the gas initially has a uniform density of 100 @xmath90 .
there is no gravity or radiative cooling in the simulation .
as the turbulence decays , the kinetic energy dissipates into thermal energy .
figure  [ fig : paper_test ] shows the dissipative heating rate computed using the method described in section  [ sec : method_2 ] in red .
the black line shows the rate at which the total thermal energy in the box increases , computed as the change in the total thermal energy divided by the time interval @xmath91 .
the green line shows the rate at which the total kinetic energy in the box decreases , computed in the same fashion . all three lines are in general good agreement with each other , indicating that the calculation does capture the amount of kinetic energy that is dissipated into heat .
however , the black line has a lower value than the green line .
this is because energy is not conserved when using zeus method .
a fraction ( less than 30% ) of the kinetic energy that is dissipated is lost instead of being added to the thermal energy .
the energy loss is less severe with lower mach numbers and higher resolution . in the simulation with mach number of 10 ,
1.9% of the total energy is lost at the end of the simulation .
when we use an initial mach number of 2 , only less than 0.1% is lost . with mach number of 10 , when we increase the resolution from @xmath92 to @xmath93 and @xmath94 grids ,
the energy loss decreases to 1.6% and 1.4% .
we discuss the consequence of the non - conservation of energy in section  [ sec : discussion_3 ] ." ," we analyze heating and cooling processes in an idealized simulation of a cool - core cluster , where momentum - driven agn feedback balances radiative cooling in a time - averaged sense . 
 we find that , on average , energy dissipation via shock waves is almost an order of magnitude higher than via turbulence . 
 most of the shock waves in the simulation are very weak shocks with mach numbers smaller than 1.5 , but the stronger shocks , although rare , dissipate energy more effectively . 
 we find that shock dissipation is a steep function of radius , with most of the energy dissipated within 30 kpc , while radiative cooling loses area less concentrated . 
 however , adiabatic processes and mixing ( of post - shock materials and the surrounding gas ) are able to redistribute the heat throughout the core . 
 a considerable fraction of the agn energy also escapes the core region . 
 the cluster goes through cycles of agn outbursts accompanied by periods of enhanced precipitation and star formation , over gyr timescales . 
 the cluster core is under - heated at the end of each cycle , but over - heated at the peak of the agn outburst . during the heating - dominant phase , 
 turbulent dissipation alone is often able to balance radiative cooling at every radius but , when this is occurs , shock waves inevitably dissipate even more energy . 
 our simulation explains why some clusters , such as abell 2029 , are cooling dominated , while in some other clusters , such as perseus , various heating mechanisms including shock heating , turbulent dissipation and bubble mixing can all individually balance cooling , and together , overheat the core . "
"near the second order phase transition , thermal and quantum fluctuations induce a short - range coherence even above the transition temperature .
the universality of physical quantities in this critical regime has been intensively studied for various types of magnetic transitions @xcite . for the second - order superconducting ( sc )
transition , the short - range coherence of sc order parameter should also be induced in the normal state , where the thermal average of order parameter does not possess the finite value . the anomaly accompanied with fluctuating sc order parameter
should be investigated to proceed universal understanding of the second - order phase transition .
the prominent effect of fluctuating sc order parameter was observed by the nernst effect measurement on cuprate superconductor @xcite , in which a vortex - like signal was detected in the critical regime above the sc transition temperature @xmath2 . to reveal the mechanism for the fluctuating sc order parameter to affect the bulk properties ,
both theoretical and experimental studies have been carried out on the high-@xmath2 cuprate superconductors @xcite .
however , enhanced magnetic fluctuations , which originate from the antiferromagnetic transition near the sc phase , contaminate the pure effect of fluctuating sc order parameter . in order to investigate the critical fluctuation of sc order parameter
, we should examine a superconductor that shows sc transition in the conventional fermi liquid state .
the observation of vortex - like signal by nernst effect measurement in an organic superconductor @xmath3-(bedt - ttf)@xmath4cu[n(cn)@xmath4]br ( bedt - ttf : bis(ethylenedithio)tetrathiafulvalene ) leads us to study the fluctuating sc state in a series of @xmath3-(bedt - ttf)@xmath7 salts @xcite , because in the organic superconductors the conventional fermi liquid state is established when superconductivity sets in . besides
, the effects associated with superconductivity can be controlled by magnetic fields , as the upper critical field @xmath8 t is accessible with conventional sc magnets @xcite .
the precursor of sc transition above @xmath2 was detected also by magnetic torque , and magnetization measurements @xcite .
these experiments probed the vortices generated by the short - range cooper pairs in the normal state , and confirmed that fluctuating sc state is realized in @xmath3-(bedt - ttf)@xmath4cu[n(cn)@xmath4]br salt .
since the fluctuating sc state has been established , we should explore the variation of quasi - particle density of states ( dos ) caused by the fluctuating sc order parameter , which is essential for the microscopic understanding of critical sc fluctuation @xcite , but can not be observed by the bulk measurements because of the large magnetization from vortices .
the nmr spectroscopy enables us to measure directly the quasi - particle dos when the system is in the fermi liquid state .
the previous nuclear spin - lattice relaxation rate @xmath9 measurement on cuprate superconductors could not observe separately the effect of sc fluctuations @xcite , because the strong spin fluctuations near antiferromagnetic phase violate the conventional fermi liquid state . in the organic superconductors , as the spin fluctuations are weak enough to stabilize the fermi liquid state above @xmath2 , nmr experiment should be performed on @xmath3-(bedt - ttf)@xmath7 salts .
the @xmath3-(bedt - ttf)@xmath10 family salts are quasi - two dimensional conductors .
when @xmath11cu(ncs)@xmath4 ( @xmath3-ncs salt ) , superconductivity is observed below @xmath12  k @xcite , and when @xmath11cu[n(cn)@xmath4]cl , antiferromagnetic transition occurs at @xmath13  k @xcite .
another superconducting salt with @xmath11cu[n(cn)@xmath4]br ( @xmath3-br salt ) locates very close to the antiferromagnetic phase , but the typical fermi liquid behavior , namely temperature independent bulk susceptibility and @xmath14 dependence of resistivity , was clearly observed below @xmath15 k @xcite .
the deuteration to @xmath3-br salt brings the electronic state toward the antiferromagnetic phase , and enhanced spin fluctuations in the deuterated @xmath3-br salt violates the fermi liquid state @xcite .
the deuterated salts are referred to as @xmath3-@xmath16$]-br ( @xmath17 ) depending of the numbers of substituted hydrogen at each ethylene group of bedt - ttf molecule .
the @xmath0c nmr experiment on @xmath3-@xmath18$]-br salt observed the reduction of @xmath1 much above @xmath2 @xcite .
this anomalous reduction of @xmath1 can be interpreted by either magnetic or sc fluctuations , just as in the case for cuprate superconductors .
therefore , we measured @xmath1 on non - deuterated @xmath3-@xmath19$]-br and @xmath3-ncs salts , which demonstrate the fermi liquid state at @xmath2 , and investigated the pure effect of fluctuation sc order parameter .
the nernst effect measurements detected the vortex - like signal above @xmath2 in @xmath3-br salt , and no such signal in @xmath3-ncs salt @xcite .
the @xmath20 anion dependence of sc criticality was interpreted as the difference in the proximity to antiferromagnetic phase .
proposed that fluctuation in the phase of sc order parameter would be induced when the quasi particles are nearly localized in the vicinity of antiferromagnetic insulator phase . on the other hand , magnetic torque measurements concluded that comparable sc fluctuation effect was observed in @xmath3-br and @xmath3-ncs salts @xcite .
this inconsistency can be due to the difference in the external field direction .
the external field was applied perpendicular to the conduction plane for the nernst effect measurement , whereas parallel to the conduction plane for the magnetic torque measurement . as the experimental constraint determines the field orientation for these techniques ,
other experiments that can be conducted in both parallel and perpendicular fields are required . in the present @xmath0c nmr experiment on @xmath3-br and @xmath3-ncs salts
, we measured @xmath1 in the magnetic field both parallel and perpendicular to the conduction plane .
the single - crystal @xmath3-br and @xmath3-ncs salts were grown using electrochemical reaction .
the typical dimension is @xmath21 mm@xmath22 .
we utilized the @xmath0c enriched bedt - ttf molecule , for which single side of the central c = c bond was enriched with @xmath0c @xcite .
this asymmetric molecule eliminates the nmr peak splitting due to the nuclear spin - spin coupling at the c = c bond ( pake doublet ) @xcite .
we determined the mean - field @xmath2 of our samples from magnetization measurement at low field as @xmath23 k for @xmath3-br , @xmath24 k for @xmath3-ncs , which are consistent with the previous studies , and evidence the high quality of our samples .     determined at each temperature .
the universal behavior was observed both in the sc and normal states , which confirms that the obtained @xmath25 reflects intrinsic character of quasi - particle density of states .
inset shows a typical @xmath0c nmr spectrum in field along @xmath26 direction . at high temperature ,
two peaks labeled as inner and outer sites were observed .
these peaks were superimposed at low temperature due to line broadening and reduction of knight shift .
, width=264 ]    the conventional saturation - recovery method was employed for the @xmath9 measurement . for @xmath3-(bedt - ttf)@xmath7 salt ,
when the field is along the @xmath26 axis , two crystallographically independent @xmath0c sites give rise to two nmr peaks , which are labeled as inner and outer sites @xcite . at high temperatures ,
these two peaks can be clearly resolved , as shown in the inset of fig .
[ fig1 ] , and the relaxation time @xmath25 can separately be determined .
as the result , the inner site is found to have three times longer @xmath25 than that for outer site .
this ratio is temperature independent , because the difference in @xmath25 is determined by the site - dependent , and temperature - independent hyperfine coupling constants . at low temperatures ,
as these peaks are not resolved due to line broadening , and the reduction of knight shift , we integrated the whole spectrum and fitted the obtained recovery curve with two component exponential function , @xmath27 we fixed the ratio @xmath28 as shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] , all the recovery curves , including the temperatures and fields above and below the sc transition , are sufficiently fitted with this function , which is represented by dashed line .
the recovery of nuclear magnetization shows a universal behavior , when the horizontal axis is scaled by @xmath29 determined at each temperature .
this scaling by @xmath25 indicates that the obtained @xmath25 characterize correctly the time scale for nuclear magnetization to relax , regardless of the fitting procedures .
we also performed nmr experiments on deuterated @xmath3-@xmath30[@xmath31-br salts ( @xmath32 ) .
for the deuterated samples , field orientation was fixed to the @xmath26 direction to eliminate the angle dependence of @xmath1 values originating from the angle dependent hyperfine coupling constant and investigated quantitatively the deuteration effect .
for @xmath3-br salt in various magnetic fields perpendicular ( a ) and parallel ( b ) to the conduction plane .
open symbol shows the temperature dependence of nmr shift in @xmath33 t. dashed line denotes the mean - field @xmath34 k , which was determined by the abrupt decrease in nmr shift .
the reduction of @xmath1 observed above @xmath2 indicates that the fluctuating sc order parameter affects the quasi - particle dos .
, width=302 ]    figure  [ fig2 ] shows the temperature dependence of @xmath35 for @xmath3-br salt in various magnetic fields .
the temperature - independent fermi liquid behavior was observed below @xmath15  k , which confirms that the magnetic fluctuations near antiferromagnetic transition are sufficiently suppressed , and the fermi liquid state is established when superconductivity sets in . in the fermi liquid state ,
@xmath1 is proportional to the square of the dos at the fermi energy @xmath36 , @xmath37 here , @xmath38 is the angle dependent hyperfine coupling constant .
this korringa relation is modified either by enhanced magnetic fluctuations near magnetic transition , or by the sc fluctuation near @xmath2 , which corrects the quasi - particle dos @xcite . the vertical dashed line in fig .
[ fig2 ] denotes the mean - field @xmath2 at @xmath33 t ( @xmath39  k ) , which was determined by the abrupt decrease in nmr shift at @xmath33 t. ( right scale of fig .
[ fig2](a ) ) when magnetic field of @xmath40 t is applied perpendicular to the conduction plane @xmath41 ( fig .
[ fig2](a ) ) , superconductivity is completely destroyed and fermi liquid behavior persists down to @xmath42  k. in smaller fields , @xmath1 deviates from the fermi liquid behavior below @xmath43  k , which is higher than the mean - field @xmath2 of @xmath44 k. we suggest that the decrease in @xmath1 above @xmath6 is caused by the fluctuating sc order parameter .
the reduction of @xmath1 was also observed in the parallel magnetic field ( fig .
[ fig2](b ) ) . as @xmath45 t is not strong enough to suppress superconductivity and induce fermi liquid behavior at low temperatures , the onset of @xmath35 reduction was determined as the temperature at which @xmath1 deviates from the high - temperature fermi liquid behavior .
the onset for @xmath41 ( @xmath43  k ) is slightly higher than that for @xmath46 ( @xmath47  k ) .
this subtle difference is due to the anisotropy of coherence length . since decrease in @xmath1 at temperatures higher than @xmath2
was observed in both @xmath41 and @xmath46 , we conclude that @xmath3-br salt shows fluctuating sc state regardless of the magnetic field directions .
theoretical study has revealed that sc fluctuations can correct quasi - particle dos in three different processes , which are called aslamazov - larkin ( al ) , maki - tompson ( mt ) , and dos processes @xcite .
the al process is irrelevant to the dynamical susceptibility , which determines @xmath1 , present results indicate that the dos process , which reduces the quasi - particle dos , is dominant in @xmath3-br salt compared to the mt process , which increases @xmath1 .     for @xmath3-ncs salt in magnetic fields perpendicular ( a ) and
parallel ( b ) to the conduction plane .
open symbol shows the temperature dependence of nmr shift in @xmath48 t , which determined the mean - field @xmath49 k. although @xmath2 is comparable to that for @xmath3-br salt , @xmath3-ncs salt shows the reduction of @xmath1 above @xmath2 only in the temperature range very close to @xmath2 .
, width=302 ]    the same measurements were performed for @xmath3-ncs salt , and the results were displayed in fig .
the fermi liquid behavior was observed at all temperature region in @xmath50 t. at a small field , deviation of @xmath1 from the fermi liquid behavior starts almost at the mean - field @xmath2 at @xmath48 t ( @xmath51  k ) .
similarly , in a parallel field , the decrease in @xmath1 from the temperature - independent value was observed only below @xmath2 .
these results indicate that the temperature region , where sc fluctuations become significant , is limited very close to @xmath2 in @xmath3-ncs salt .
now , we compare the results of @xmath3-br and @xmath3-ncs salts .
although sc transition occurs at comparable temperatures in both salts , the reduction of @xmath1 due to the sc fluctuation was observed only in @xmath3-br salt , in consistent with nernst effect and magnetization measurements @xcite .
the sc parameters for @xmath3-br and @xmath3-ncs salts should be compared to understand the universal behavior of fluctuating sc state .
estimated from the temperature dependence of @xmath9 in the sc state .
the vertical axis is @xmath9 scaled by the value at @xmath2 , and the horizontal axis is the reduced temperature @xmath52 .
we estimated @xmath53 by fitting the experimental data to the theoretical curve for the @xmath30-wave superconductor .
, width=283 ]    in the critical regime above @xmath2 , the short - range sc coherence can be observed when the thermal energy becomes comparable to the energy cost required to induce sc gap within the pippard length @xmath54 .
therefore , the critical temperature range is determined by the sc gap size @xmath55 , @xmath2 , and @xmath54 , as @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the in - plane and inter - plane pippard length .
the experimentally determined pippard lengths are @xmath59 nm and @xmath60 nm for @xmath3-br , and @xmath61 nm and @xmath62 nm for @xmath3-ncs @xcite .
the typical temperature range for a three - dimensional bcs superconductor is as narrow as @xmath63 .
wider critical regime is expected for low dimensional superconductors with short @xmath58 .
our experimental results suggest that @xmath64 of @xmath3-br salt reaches to the order of @xmath65 , which is comparable to the results obtained for high-@xmath2 cuprate .
we estimated the ratio @xmath66 from the temperature dependence of @xmath9 in the sc state .
figure  [ fig4 ] shows the temperature dependence of @xmath67 normalized at @xmath2 for @xmath3-br and @xmath3-ncs salts .
the power - law temperature dependence suggests that @xmath30-wave superconductivity with nodes on sc gap is realized in both @xmath3-br and @xmath3-ncs salts .
the fit to the temperature dependence with the theoretical curve for @xmath30-wave superconductivity gives the estimation of @xmath68 , which are @xmath69 for @xmath3-br salt and @xmath70 for @xmath3-ncs salt .
the ratio between @xmath3-br and @xmath3-ncs salts is in perfect agreement with the values reported in the literature @xcite .
we note that the large @xmath55 for @xmath3-br salt seems to reduce critical temperature regime defined in eq .
( [ eq1 ] ) .
however , because the pippard length is also related to @xmath55 as @xmath71 , the larger @xmath55 increases the critical regime by reducing the coherence length .
here we assumed that only the coherence length in the conduction plane @xmath57 is determined by @xmath55 because of the two - dimensional nature of superconductivity in @xmath3 salts .
in fact , @xmath57 for @xmath3-br salt is twice shorter than that for @xmath3-ncs salt , whereas @xmath58 is almost comparable between @xmath3-br and @xmath3-ncs salts @xcite .    .
strong temperature dependence due to the reduction of spin term was observed in @xmath3-@xmath18$]-br salt , while @xmath3-@xmath19$]-br and @xmath3-@xmath72$]-br salts show the fl liquid behavior below @xmath15 k. in @xmath3-@xmath18$]-br , the effects of the sc fluctuation was contaminated by the strong magnetic fluctuations near the antiferromagnetic phase transition .
, width=302 ]    the larger @xmath55 is expected for the deuterated @xmath3-@xmath18$]-br salt , which locates very close to the antiferromagnetic phase .
previous nmr study for @xmath3-@xmath18$]-br salt suggested a possibility that the critical sc regime starts from rather high temperatures @xcite .
we also measured @xmath1 near @xmath2 for @xmath3-@xmath16$]-br salts with @xmath73 applying the magnetic field of @xmath45 t along the @xmath26 direction . in fig .
[ fig5 ] , a strong temperature dependence of @xmath1 was observed around @xmath15  k in @xmath3-@xmath18$]-br salt in consistent with previous report @xcite .
this behavior can not be directly interpreted as the effect of fluctuating sc order parameter , because enhanced magnetic fluctuations contaminate the pure effect of sc fluctuations . in the vicinity of antiferromagnetic phase transition ,
the observed @xmath1 is the sum of the contributions from weakly correlated fermi surface ( fl term ) and strongly nested fermi surface at the ordering vector @xmath74 ( spin term ) , @xmath75 the strong temperature dependence observed in @xmath3-@xmath18$]-br salt indicates that the spin term remains dominant until low temperatures .
the increase in @xmath1 by enhanced magnetic fluctuations was observed only above @xmath76 k in @xmath3-@xmath19$]-br and @xmath3-@xmath72$]-br salts .
this spin term is suppressed below @xmath15 k , and the fermi liquid state is stabilized at @xmath2 in these salts .
the comparable constant value of @xmath77  s@xmath78k@xmath78 indicates that the deuteration does not significantly modify the fl term .
we suggest , from the deuteration independent behavior of @xmath1 below @xmath43 k , that @xmath3-@xmath18$]-br salt also shows the reduction of fl term due to sc fluctuation near @xmath2 , although details were hindered by the spin term .
in conclusion , we observed the reduction of @xmath1 starting above @xmath6 in @xmath3-br salt in fields both parallel and perpendicular to the conduction plane , and addressed the fluctuating sc order parameter as the origin of this reduction .
the microscopic nmr experiment enabled the direct observation of quasi - particle dos in the fluctuating sc state .
we revealed that , in the fluctuating sc state in @xmath3-br salt , the quasi - particle dos is reduced from the normal - state value because of the dominant dos process . in @xmath3-ncs salt ,
the reduction of quasi - particle dos due to sc fluctuation was observed only in the temperature range very close to @xmath2 .
our systematic study clarified the field - orientation dependence of the sc fluctuation and convinced that the sc fluctuation has larger effect on @xmath1 in @xmath3-br salt than that in @xmath3-ncs salt . from the estimation of sc gap size for @xmath3-br and @xmath3-ncs salts
, we suggest that the small critical regime in @xmath3-ncs salt is due to the long coherence length .
we also measured @xmath1 in the deuterated @xmath3-@xmath16$]-br salts , and found that the deuteration induces the large spin term even at @xmath2 , which contaminates the pure effect of sc fluctuation .
these results indicate that @xmath3-@xmath19$]-br salt is an ideal system to study pure effect of sc fluctuation , and provide microscopic information to understand the electronic properties in the fluctuating sc state .

"any `` activity '' found in a galactic nucleus  be it due to massive star formation , an accreting super - massive black hole , or a combination of both  requires the inflow of gas into the central few pc . on scales of kpc ,
the gas flow is regulated by the response to asymmetries in the gravitational potential , e.g. stellar bar or tidal interactions @xcite .
numerical models ( e.g. * ? ? ?
* ; * ? ? ?
* ) have demonstrated that large - scale stellar bars are especially efficient in moving gas into the central kpc .
however , no clear picture is yet available for the gas flow inside a few 100 pc from the nucleus @xcite .    arguably the simplest galaxies to observationally test these models are the latest - type spirals , because they have bulge - less disks .
however , even these objects have rather complex central star formation histories .
about 75% of late - type disks host distinct nuclear star clusters @xcite , most of which have experienced multiple discrete star formation events in their history @xcite .
so far , it is unclear whether the repetitive star formation in these nuclear clusters is due to variability of the gravitational potential ( e.g. dissolution / formation of a stellar bar ) , the clumpy nature of the molecular gas ( e.g. inflow of discrete giant molecular complexes 
gmcs ) , or whether nuclear massive star formation itself is disrupting the gas supply .
the scd spiral is one of the nearest examples of a late - type spiral harboring a well - studied nuclear star cluster .
the nuclear cluster has a stellar mass of @xmath1 and its luminosity is dominated by a recent , 430  myr  old , short - lived star formation event ( after correction for a revised distance of 3.0 mpc ; * ? ? ?
* ; * ? ? ?
* ; * ? ? ?
previous studies of the molecular gas in ic342 , with single dish and interferometric millimeter instruments @xcite , lack sufficient spatial resolution ( 5872  pc ) to resolve the structure of the gmcs , thus hampering accurate comparisons with the nuclear star formation .
the spiral geometry of the molecular gas in the central 500pc is due to the response of the gas to the large - scale stellar bar @xcite .
a comprehensive study @xcite of the molecular chemistry in ic342 has demonstrated that the molecular gas in the central few hundred pc is subject to a number of different excitation mechanisms .
recent ovro observations of the @xmath2co(2 - 1 ) line showed evidence for molecular gas being associated with the nuclear star cluster itself @xcite .
the @xmath2co(2 - 1 ) and hcn(1 - 0 ) lines tracing the total and dense molecular gas content were observed with the iram plateau de bure interferometer ( pdbi ) in 2005 january / february and 2004 january , respectively . for calibration and mapping
, we used the standard iram gildas software packages clic and mapping @xcite .
the observations resulted in data cubes of @xmath3 and @xmath4 resolution with an rms of 10 and 3.6 mjy / beam for the co(2 - 1 ) and hcn(1 - 0 ) line .
intensity maps were derived using a 3@xmath5 cut for line emission present over at least two channel of 3.0 ( 6.0 ) km / s width .    for a direct comparison of the ( dense ) molecular gas to the stellar light and the ionized gas ( as observed with hst ) , the hst data need to have an absolute astrometry of better than at least 0.5  . to achieve this , we first aligned a newly obtained hst pa@xmath6 image ( pi calzetti , pid 11080 ) to a deep 6 cm continuum vla image ( pi schinnerer ) as both exhibit a very similar geometry at comparable angular resolution ( 0.4  vs. 0.75  ) .
archival hst f656n and f606w images ( pid 8581 , 5446 ) were then aligned to the pa@xmath6 map using a number of stellar clusters . to obtain the continuum - subtracted h@xmath6 map
, we subtracted a scaled version of the f606w image from f656n .
no astrometric corrections are required for radio interferometric data as the observations provide an absolute astrometric reference frame .
this resulted in very well aligned optical / nir and radio images , solving the ambiguities that plagued our previous study which relied on the geometry of the dust lanes @xcite .
in the new co(2 - 1 ) and hcn(1 - 0 ) maps ( fig . [
fig : sum ] ) , the eastern spiral arm exhibits a prominent break at @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( j2000 ) , about 4  east and 1  south of the galaxy center . at this break the eastern spiral arm stops continuing inward and stays at a roughly constant distance from the nucleus whereas the western spiral arm reaches close ( within 1  ) to the nucleus itself .
the nuclear co(2 - 1 ) gas clump identified earlier @xcite is now resolved into a faint , narrow gas lane running east - west just north of the nucleus .
in addition , the southern portion of the eastern spiral arm exhibits a sharp edge on the side facing the nucleus .
the geometry of the hcn emission closely resembles that of the co(2 - 1 ) , except for the western spiral arm which extends further towards the nucleus in hcn while the emission north of it is too diffuse to be detected in hcn .
the central cavity in the molecular gas distribution is displaced from the nucleus to the southeast and offers a relatively unobscured view onto the stellar disk , as demonstrated by the comparison to the optical continuum ( fig .
[ fig : sum ] ) : the stellar disk is substantially fainter wherever molecular gas is present . both co(2 - 1 ) and hcn emission trace very well the prominent dust lanes in the central 250pc .
this dramatic change in extinction causes an elongation of the isophotes even at nir wavelengths , which might be misinterpreted as a small - scale bar
. a comparison of the co(2 - 1 ) and h@xmath6 distribution ( fig .
[ fig : ha ] ) shows that the ionized gas fills the central cavity of the molecular gas .
in particular , the h@xmath6 shells ( or arcs ) delineating the southeast edge of the cavity suggest an ionized outflow that coincides with the inner edge of the southeastern co(2 - 1 ) spiral arm .
due to ic342 s almost face - on orientation , the gas motions are difficult to interpret , as we start to observe a blend of several smaller molecular clouds plus streaming motions due to the stellar bar and a mix of the diffuse and dense gas component in the co(2 - 1 ) emission .      while the overall molecular gas distribution in the center of ic342 is governed by the gravitational influence of a large - scale stellar bar @xcite ( also as evidenced by the presence of shocks seen in ch@xmath9oh and sio ,
* ; * ? ? ?
* ) , the asymmetries in the molecular gas properties within the inner 50 pc can be explained by the impact of nuclear star formation onto this gas flow .
the comparison of the molecular gas distribution to the h@xmath6 image suggests that the expanding ionized gas is running into the molecular gas , particularly in the southeastern portion of the spiral arm ( hereafter : segment ) . as we will show in  [ sec : feed ] , the displacement of this arm segment is in agreement with mechanical energy input into the total and dense molecular gas , leading to it being compressed and pushed out , or at least halted by the pressure of the ionized gas .
@xcite have shown that this part of the spiral ( gmc  a ) is the one most excited by uv photons and more diffuse than the rest of the dense gmcs .
radiative excitation by the nucleus can be excluded as it is not an agn or a uv source @xcite .
the discontinuity in the eastern spiral arm as well as the different chemical properties of this arm segment argue against a simple offset of the gas spiral from the dynamical center .
taken together , this suggests an impact from stellar winds and supernova explosions on the morphology of circumnuclear molecular gas as well as altering its chemical composition .    some evidence for a corresponding discontinuity along the northern portion of the western arm ( thin dotted line in fig .
[ fig : sketch ] ) is observed in co(21 ) .
however the weak h@xmath6 emission , the lack of an altered chemistry and the hcn morphology makes the case for direct impact of stellar winds and sne less clear here .
the exact reasons for the asymmetry manifested by the outflow from the nuclear starburst ( as seen in the h@xmath6 line ) are unclear , but a such behavior is not unusual for large - scale outflows from central star formation ( e.g. m82 ; * ? ? ?
potentially the northern portion of the western spiral arm might lack these signs because it is composed of more dispersed molecular material .
in addition , the higher extinction on the near - side ( western side ) of the galaxy can cause some differences as well .
although the dynamical timescale in the nuclear region is very small ( @xmath10 10myr ) , the spiral pattern itself is rotating slower . as nuclear spirals can easily be excited by large - scale bars ( e.g. ,
* ; * ? ? ?
* ) , we can use the pattern speed of the stellar bar of @xmath11 = 0.4 km / s/  @xcite . at a radius of 3.3  ( 50pc )
this corresponds to a velocity of 8km / s , thus one revolution of the spiral pattern itself takes about 40myr . for a 10 myr old
starburst the spiral has moved by a quarter .
this is consistent with the arm segment which covers about a quarter of a circle and also the age for the most recent star formation event in the nuclear cluster .
to summarize , the ionizing outflow produced by stellar winds and supernovae from the recent nuclear star forming event appears to have changed the location of the southern part of the eastern spiral arm , while the western spiral arm appears less effected .
if the gas flow along the western arm is less disturbed by the nuclear bubble , this may explain why the youngest star formation episode is also asymmetrically stronger towards the western arm ( e.g. * ? ? ?
we now investigate whether the timescale and required energy are indeed compatible with the scenario outlined above .
the dislocation is either due to an actual movement of individual molecular clouds against the gravitational potential or the ionized gas is acting as a barrier altering the orbits of the molecular gas . in both scenarios , some kind of force
is required to counterbalance the gravitational potential , thus the following estimates should be valid in either case .
the deprojected distance from the nuclear cluster to the h@xmath6 rim is about 3.3 ' or 50pc .
a shell with a typical expansion velocity of 20 - 40 km / s @xcite can travel this distance in about ( 2.4 - 1.2 ) myr , which is less than the age of the last nuclear star formation episode ( 4 - 30 myr ) . to first order
, it is therefore possible that the h@xmath6 shells were produced in this event .
assuming that the southeastern arm segment has been ` pushed ' to a larger radius , we can derive a rough estimate for the required cumulative energy using the mass of the molecular gas and reasonable assumptions about the gravitational potential .
we assume a virial gas mass of @xmath12 for the southeastern segment @xcite . to estimate the kinetic and potential energy required
, we use the rotation curve of @xcite after correcting for the new distance to estimate velocities of v(r@xmath13=50pc)@xmath025 km / s and v(r@xmath14=22pc)@xmath012 km / s .
a total energy of @xmath15/2\cong 2.2\times10^{52 } erg$ ] is required to move the molecular gas mass from a radius of 18pc ( the location of the unaffected western spiral arm ) to 50pc , the current distance of the southeastern segment ( inclination effects are neglected given the low inclination of @xmath16 , * ? ? ? * ) .
a cluster with a stellar mass of @xmath17 releases a mechanical luminosity of @xmath18 at an age of 4 - 30 myr ( assuming an instantaneous burst with solar metallicity ; see starburst99 models , * ? ? ?
* ) . since the flux - calibrated continuum - subtracted hst pa@xmath6 image suffers less dust extinction than the h@xmath6 image ( fig .
[ fig : ha ] ) , we use the former for a consistency check .
the pa@xmath6 line flux of the ionized gas bubble ( @xmath19 ) can be converted into a h@xmath6 luminosity of @xmath20 using a h@xmath6/pa@xmath6 ratio of 7.82 appropriate for a metal - rich region ( without extinction correction ) . assuming that about 3% of the mechanical energy is converted into h@xmath6 luminosity @xcite and a filling factor of about 0.5 for the bubble ( from the flux present inside the bubble ) , this translates into a mechanical luminosity of about @xmath21 .
this is consistent with the above value derived from the cluster mass and age .
thus over the course of the derived travel time of 2 myrs a total mechanical energy of @xmath22 will be produced .
however , this mechanical energy is distributed over the entire sphere and subject to radiative losses . assuming a filling factor of only 3% for gmc - a and radiative losses of 90% , plus taking into account that likely only a fraction of 20% of the nuclear stellar mass
was produced in the last event , an energy of @xmath23 is expected to be available for mechanical interaction .
even this rather conservative estimate for the available mechanical energy is sufficient to explain the gas morphology .
we conclude that , based on time and energetic arguments , mechanical feedback from nuclear star formation is a plausible explanation for the observed molecular gas distribution .
the following picture for the gas flow in ic342 emerges ( fig .
[ fig : sketch ] ) : the large - scale stellar bar moves gas toward the center via two gas spiral arms .
the stellar winds and supernova shocks released by the most recent nuclear star formation event have significantly altered the path of the molecular gas towards the center on the last few 10pc , thus currently preventing efficient fueling of the nucleus .
this is the first time strong evidence has been found for mechanical feedback of nuclear star formation onto the ( disk ) gas _ flow _ in an extragalactic nucleus . as the large - scale stellar bar continues to move gas towards the center , it is likely that the gas resumes its old path once the mechanical energy has been dispersed .
presumably , the nucleus will then again collect molecular gas until the next star formation episode .
this feedback between nuclear activity and fueling efficiency appears to self - regulate the rate of nuclear star formation and offers a natural explanation for the repetitive star formation found in nuclear star clusters @xcite .
if correct , this scenario implies that models for the gas fueling mechanism ( over the innermost 1 - 100pc ) can not rely on the shape of the gravitational potential alone but need to take the effect of mechanical energy released by nuclear activity onto the gas flow into account
. the impact of this feedback process will be strongly variable in time and will critically depend on the amount of energy released as well as its geometry .
although mechanical feedback has long been suspected to be important for galactic nuclei , so far no observations have existed to directly support this . in a broader sense , these results also have implications for the evolution of any central massive object ( be it a stellar cluster or a black hole ) that requires occasional fueling .
nuclear activity appears to have the potential to significantly reduce or even ( temporarily ) shut off fueling , thus self - regulating the growth of the central mass .

 the morphology of the tracers suggests that the molecular gas flow caused by a large - scale stellar bar has been strongly affected by the mechanical feedback from recent star formation activity within the central 100pc in the nucleus of the galaxy . 
 possibly , stellar winds and/or supernova shocks originating in the nuclear star cluster have compressed , and likely pushed outward , the infalling molecular gas , thus significantly reducing the gas supply to the central 10pc . 
 although our analysis currently lacks kinematic confirmation due to the face - on orientation of ic342 , the described scenario is supported by the generally observed repetitive nature of star formation in the nuclear star clusters of late - type spiral galaxies . "
"liquid crystals ( lcs ) are phases of matter in which the anisotropy of the particles determines under specific conditions a partial spontaneous breaking of the spatial symmetries of the system , thus manifesting features in between the crystalline solid and the isotropic liquid phase .
the notion that entropic effects alone are sufficient to drive the self - assembly of ordered liquid crystal phases is well established in colloid science @xcite .
model systems of hard particles constitute the natural choice to describe the phase and aggregation behavior of most colloidal systems , as the main interactions established between their particles have a repulsive , steric origin . as a consequence ,
a hard - particle fluid does not have internal energy and minimizing its free energy is equivalent to maximizing its entropy .    in his seminal work
, onsager showed that mere hard - core repulsions between infinitely thin rigid cylinders are able to determine an entropy - driven phase transition from the isotropic to the nematic phase , and hence the existence of a spontaneous orientational order @xcite .
the evolution of simulation techniques in the past decades allowed to investigate the more realistic case of rods with finite size , showing that by varying the length - to - diameter ratio one- ( smectic ) , two- ( columnar ) and three- ( crystal ) dimensional translational ordered phases can be encountered @xcite .
further more accurate studies showed that for a monodisperse system of both aligned @xcite and freely rotating @xcite hard spherocylinders the columnar phase happens to be metastable with respect to the smectic phase for each value of the length - to - diameter ratio .
the complexity of the phase behavior of linear particles becomes even more pronounced by proceeding from monodisperse systems to mixtures @xcite . in particular , size polydispersity introduces a sensible change in the phase behavior of rod - like particles as their packing is not as effective as that of monodisperse rods .
in fact , it was observed that in a system of hard spherocylinders the formation of smectic layers can be inhibited by introducing a length bidispersity , in such a way that the columnar phase can become thermodynamically stable @xcite .
entropy - driven columnar phase transitions have been observed in monodisperse systems of disc - like particles , such as cut spheres or oblate spherocylinders @xcite .
as far as rod - like particles are concerned , theoretical studies indicated that the columnar order can be observed not only in bidisperse mixtures , but also in more realistic polydisperse systems of parallel cylinders @xcite .
polydispersity is not the only element which favors the stabilization of the columnar phase in a system of rods , as was shown in ref .
@xcite where a monodisperse system of soft - core rods was considered . on the other hand , the effect of rod flexibility in stabilizing the columnar phase is still under debate @xcite .    with the improvement in understanding and describing static and thermodynamic properties of lcs , the interest towards the dynamics correspondingly increased .
in particular , most of the studies in this direction were devoted to analyze the anisotropy of the diffusion by the measurement of the self - diffusion coefficients in different mesophases @xcite . for lyotropic lcs
these results found good overall agreement with experiments based on techniques such as fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( frap ) @xcite . on the other hand , only few studies focused on the analysis of the dynamical phenomena at the single - particle level , where fluorescence microscopy was applied to investigate the lc phases in colloidal suspensions of _ fd _ virus @xcite .
this approach allowed to observe for the first time the mechanism of interlayer diffusion , or permeation , which characterizes the dynamics of the system in the smectic phase @xcite .
in fact , the layered structure of smectic lcs , which determines an effective periodic mean - field potential , influences the motion in the direction perpendicular to the smectic layers with the appearance of jumps of the order of the rod length . as a result of this quasi - quantized diffusion , at intermediate time intervals
one can distinguish between `` slow '' particles , which rattle around the center of a column , and `` fast '' particles , which jump to another column .
this heterogeneous dynamics accounts for deviations from gaussianity in the diffusion , a phenomenon which is also well known in homogeneous complex fluids such as supercooled liquids @xcite and gels @xcite . in the light of these results , a theoretical approach based on dynamic density functional theory using the second virial approximation focused on the role played by the local fluid structure of the system , which competes with the permanent barriers due to the smectic structure , thus increasing even more the analogies with fluids close to a dynamical arrest transition @xcite .
simulations on aligned @xcite and freely rotating @xcite hard spherocylinders confirmed qualitatively both these studies and pointed out the effect of dynamical heterogeneities on the structural relaxation of the system , which deviates from the exponential decay expected for simple fluids . furthermore , in refs .
@xcite it was shown that the heterogeneous dynamics in the smectic phase of hard spherocylinders is tightly related to cooperative motion of particles through the smectic layers .    following this line of research and motivated by a recent experiment on _ fd _ virus @xcite , we investigate in this paper the dynamics of a binary mixture of rod - like particles which exhibits a stable columnar liquid crystal phase .
using monte carlo ( mc ) simulations we are able to study for the first time the dynamical heterogeneities which arise from the columnar structure and their effect on the diffusion and on the long - time structural relaxation of the system .
furthermore , we measure the height of the inter - column energetic barriers and compare our results with the simulation data available for the smectic phase @xcite .
conventional mc dynamics has been extensively applied to study the origin of non - exponential relaxation of glass - forming liquids @xcite .
mc and molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations of lennard - jones fluids @xcite showed that the particle dynamics at large time scales are the same , but are different at small time scales , as the stochastic motion of particles can not be detected by the deterministic approach of md simulations .
the paper is organized as follows . in section
ii we introduce the model , the simulation details and the physical properties which were measured in order to describe the dynamics of the system .
the results of these measurements , which confirm the presence of dynamical heterogeneities also in the columnar phase and are in general agreement with the observations in the smectic phase , are discussed in section iii , whereas in section iv we illustrate our conclusions .
we study a system containing @xmath0 perfectly aligned hard spherocylinders with aspect ratio @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are , respectively , the length and diameter of a cylindrical body capped by two hemispheres with diameter @xmath3 .
the phase diagram of a monodisperse system containing such rod - like particles shows stable nematic , smectic , and crystal phases , but lacks a stable columnar phase in the range @xmath4 @xcite .
stroobants studied the phase behavior of bidisperse systems of hard rods and found that the bidispersity can favor and stabilize columnar order over smectic order @xcite .
therefore , to prevent the formation of smectic layers , we investigate a binary mixture of hard spherocylinders with the same diameter @xmath3 ( used as our unit of length ) , but different lengths @xmath5 and @xmath6 , with @xmath7 . in this model ,
the rotational degrees of freedom are frozen out and hence the particles are forced to be aligned along a common nematic director , oriented along the _ z _ axis .
the relative concentration of the two species is set in such a way that the binary mixture is kept at its equivalence point , where the volume fractions of each component are the same .
the phase diagram at fixed @xmath8 displays a region of stability of the columnar phase which increases with @xmath5 and disappears at @xmath9 , where a nematic - smectic transition is observed @xcite .
here we study a columnar ordered binary mixture of rods with @xmath10 and @xmath8 , and relative concentrations @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively . for lower pressures ,
this columnar phase transforms into a nematic phase , while for higher pressures it freezes into a crystal phase .
we performed standard mc simulations in a rectangular box of volume @xmath13 with periodic boundary conditions . to equilibrate the columnar phase
, we performed runs in the isobaric - isothermal ( _ npt _ ) ensemble , where the particle moves were accepted according to the metropolis algorithm @xcite , that is if no particle overlap was detected .
each mc cycle consisted of _ n _ attempts to displace a randomly selected particle , plus an attempt to modify the box volume with independent changes of the three box sides .
the system was considered to be in equilibrium when the volume reached a stationary value within the statistical fluctuations .
we run simulations at several reduced pressures @xmath14 , where @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the boltzmann s constant and _
t _ the absolute temperature .
in particular , we equilibrated a nematic phase at @xmath17 ( packing fraction @xmath18 with @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) the single particle volume ) which is very close to the nematic - columnar transition , and three different columnar phases at @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) , @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) and @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) . in all these cases , our starting configuration consisted of a highly packed columnar structure with the rods randomly located along the _ z _ direction , and hexagonally ordered in the _ xy _ plane .
the minimum number of mc cycles needed for an equilibration run was @xmath27 , and was followed by a production run of @xmath28 mc cycles in the canonical ( _ nvt _ ) ensemble to simulate the relaxation dynamics and evaluate all the physical properties of interest . in this case , the box volume was kept fixed to prevent unphysical collective moves which do not mimic the brownian dynamics of the particles properly .
it was proved that in rod suspensions the contribution of hydrodynamics can at first approximation be neglected with respect to steric effects , which result in excluded volume interactions @xcite . under these conditions
, the mc approach offers an important tool to study the dynamics of colloids , since , in spite of its intrinsically non - dynamical nature , it is able to reproduce the brownian diffusion typical of such kind of systems @xcite . to pursue this goal
, one must set a small enough maximum mc displacement , typically of the order of one tenth of the shortest dimension of the particle . the optimal value of the mean particle displacement is strictly linked to the acceptance rate and hence to the cpu time per simulation run .
if the displacement is chosen too small , the system would need longer runs to properly explore the configurational space .
the same effect is expected with too big displacements , as most of the particle moves would cause overlaps and therefore would be rejected .
however , any reasonable and convenient choice of the average step size should not affect the dynamics at long time scales .
we tested that , apart from an overall scaling , this was the case .
the maximum displacement was fixed to give an acceptance rate of roughly 50% per move . furthermore , to take into account the non - spherical shape of the particles , the maximum mc displacement was set in such a way that at short times it reproduces the anisotropic diffusion of a single colloidal rod .
more specifically , this means that the ratio between the maximum mc displacement in the @xmath29 plane @xmath30 and in the @xmath31 direction @xmath32 must be set as    @xmath33    where we denoted with @xmath34 and @xmath35 the short - time self - diffusion coefficients of the rod in the direction parallel and perpendicular to its long axis , respectively . to give an estimate for the ratio @xmath36 , which solely depends on the geometry of the particle
, we referred to the semi - empirical expression derived in ref .
@xcite . in that work ,
the authors used a numerical approach to evaluate the translational self - diffusion coefficients of a cylindrical particle for different values of the length - to - diameter ratio @xmath37 , finding good overall agreement with experimental data in the range @xmath38 @xcite .
a least - square quadratic fitting in @xmath39 of the data allowed the authors to give an expression for the transverse and longitudinal self - diffusion coefficients as functions of the parameter @xmath37 .
since here we consider spherocylinders , we evaluated the ratio @xmath36 by setting @xmath40 , arguing that possible deviations given by the non - cylindrical shape of the particles were irrelevant . according to the above - mentioned expression ,
the ratio between the maximum mc displacement perpendicular and parallel to the @xmath31 axis was set to @xmath41 for particles of species @xmath42 and @xmath43 for those of species @xmath44 .
moreover , since the transverse section of the particles is the same for the two species , we set the same maximum mc displacement along the @xmath31 axis for the two components .
once the short - time self - diffusion coefficients are known , it is possible to introduce a time scale defined by @xmath45 , where the total translational diffusion coefficient @xmath46 is evaluated in terms of the longitudinal and transverse short - time diffusion coefficients averaged over the two species @xcite .    in order to analyze the heterogeneous diffusion and the structural relaxation of the system
, the following physical properties were calculated : ( i ) the transverse mean - field potential , ( ii ) the self - part of the van hove function ( svhf ) , ( iii ) the distinct - part of the van hove function ( dvhf ) , ( iv ) the mean square displacement ( msd ) , ( v ) the non - gaussian parameter ( ngp ) and ( vi ) the self - part of the intermediate scattering function ( sisf ) .
_ _ in a liquid crystal phase characterized by columnar order the translational invariance is spontaneously broken in the plane perpendicular to the nematic director .
this gives rise to a non homogeneous ( relative ) probability @xmath47 of finding a particle of species @xmath20 at position @xmath48 in the plane perpendicular to the nematic director .
the effective energetic barrier which tends to confine the particle inside a column is given by the mean - field potential @xmath49 , defined as @xcite    @xmath50 , \label{eq1}\ ] ]    where the proportionality constant is chosen in such a way that the minima of the potential is set to zero .
_ _ the heterogeneous dynamics and hopping - type inter - column diffusion can be quantitatively described by the svhf @xcite    @xmath51    which measures the probability distribution for a particle displacement @xmath52 in a time interval @xmath53 . since the present system is characterized by a translational symmetry along the nematic director , it is natural to separately study the diffusion along the _ z _ axis and in the _ xy _ plane .
this can be done by partially integrating the svhf on the @xmath29 plane to get its longitudinal component    @xmath54    and along the @xmath31 axis to get its transverse component , which can be further averaged over the azimuthal angle of @xmath52 @xmath55    in the above equations @xmath56 is the position of particle @xmath57 at time @xmath53 , @xmath58 is the dirac delta , @xmath59 stands for an ensemble average and the index @xmath60 indicates an additional average over the polar angle , which defines the bidimensional vector @xmath61 with modulus @xmath62 .
it should be noticed that for freely diffusive particles these functions are described by a gaussian .    _ _ a description of the influence of the surrounding particles background on the single particle diffusion is given by the dvhf , which is the probability distribution on the relative position @xmath52 of two different particles at different times    @xmath63    in order to separately study the caging regime related to the local fluid structure in the direction longitudinal and transverse to the nematic director , we actually measured the dvhf partially integrated over the size occupied by the spherocylinder in the _ xy _ plane and along the _ z _ axis , defined , respectively , by    @xmath64    @xmath65    where we set @xmath66 and @xmath67 is the azimuthal angle of @xmath52 in the @xmath29 plane .
_ _ the deviations of the diffusion from gaussian behavior can be estimated by the ngp , defined as @xcite    @xmath68    where @xmath69 is the displacement of a particle during a time interval @xmath53 .
@xmath70 corresponds to the number of dimensions considered , so that @xmath71 for the linear diffusion longitudinal to the nematic director ( @xmath72 ) and @xmath73 for the planar transverse diffusion ( @xmath74 ) . as pointed out in ref .
@xcite , when treating mixtures one should be careful in not taking into account trivial non - gaussianity due to a size - dependent particle mobility .
in order to describe the dynamical heterogeneities related exclusively to the permanent barriers of the lc phase , one has to calculate the ngp @xmath75 as defined in eq .
( [ eq7 ] ) for each species @xmath20 separately and then perform an average weighted over the concentrations @xmath76 , i.e.    @xmath77    with these definitions heterogeneous diffusion can be detected when the ngp deviates from zero value .

the development of a long - range translational order allows to interpret the diffusion as the motion of a single particle subject to a periodic mean - field potential @xmath91 as defined in eq .
( [ eq1 ] ) .
this approach was applied in experiments @xcite and simulations @xcite to characterize the hopping - type diffusion in smectic liquid crystals along the nematic director .
these authors found that the free - energy cost for the layer - to - layer diffusion is in the order of few @xmath92 per particle , depending mostly on the packing of the system , but also on the anisotropy and rotational degrees of freedom of the rods . since the system studied here
is composed of two species , the mean - field potential was evaluated separately for each component and is shown in fig .
[ fig2 ] for several pressures .
the minima of the potential correspond to the lattice position , and the height of the energetic barriers gives a quantitative description of the energetic demand associated to a column - to - column jump . in order to estimate the height of the energetic barriers for each species as a function of pressure
, we report in fig .
[ fig2bis ] a transverse section of the energy landscapes in fig .
[ fig2 ] . following the procedure in ref .
@xcite , the experimental points in fig .
[ fig2bis ] were fitted with a function @xmath101^{2k } , \label{pot_fit}\ ] ] with @xmath102 and @xmath103 fit parameters and @xmath104 . as expected , the height of the potential barrier increases with the packing fraction and with the particle anisotropy , as already observed in ref
. @xcite . at significant packing fractions
, we detect that the energetic barriers appear higher for long rods .
in particular , at @xmath93 and @xmath25 the column - to - column jumps become so rare that the associated statistics is too poor to furnish a precise estimate of the barrier height . in other words ,
the long rods are constrained to rattle in their cage , the jump to a neighboring column being too demanding .
this is due to the fact that at high packing fraction no mc configuration showed a long rod in the region between the columns , with the result that the mean - field potential was characterized by an unphysical divergence .
furthermore , one should notice that the typical height of the barriers , close to and even higher than @xmath105 , is significantly higher than in the smectic phase @xcite .
this can be seen by comparing our data at @xmath93 ( @xmath24 ) with those in ref .
@xcite for the smectic phase of a system of aligned hard spherocylinders with @xmath106 at pressure @xmath107 ( @xmath24 ) . in the latter
the height of the energy barrier reaches a value close to @xmath108 , which is expected to be even lower for shorter rods , as noticed in ref .
@xcite .

the effect of the periodic mean - field potential can be further appreciated in fig .
[ fig3 ] , where we show a typical trajectory projected on the @xmath29 plane of a long and a short particle at @xmath21 .
the difference with the gaussian diffusion typical of a simple liquid , where the particle trajectories resemble the behavior of a random walker , is evident . in this case
, the dynamics of the system is characterized by a hopping - type diffusion , in which each particle tends to rattle around the center of a column until it finds suitable conditions to overcome the energetic barrier and jump to another column in quasi - quantized steps .
the spread in the total displacement between the two species is due to the higher barriers felt by the long rods , which significantly inhibit the inter - column diffusion .
this behavior is observed in the whole range of pressures considered here , and its effects on the long - time relaxation dynamics of the system are crucial . more specifically , the long rods are expected to sample the configurational space on a time scale which might be significantly longer than that needed for the small ones .
as a consequence , the decay of the correlation functions is strongly affected by the slow diffusion of the long particles , as we show later on .

[ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] the self - part of the van hove function ( svhf ) in its transverse and longitudinal components respectively .
the comparison between the behavior of the transverse svhf in the nematic ( fig .
[ fig4]a ) and in the columnar ( fig .
[ fig4]b , [ fig4]c , and [ fig4]d ) phase reveals a drastic change in the dynamics .
the svhf in the nematic phase is a monotonic function which broadens with time . by entering the columnar phase
one observes the appearance of peaks which correspond to the positions of the hexagonal lattice in the @xmath29 plane .
as expected , after a fixed time interval the number and height of the peaks depend on the packing fraction of the system , so that by increasing the pressure the number of peaks decreases due to higher energetic barriers .
these results confirm what was already observed for the smectic phase in experiments @xcite , simulation @xcite and theory @xcite , i.e. the partial translational symmetry breaking in a liquid crystal gives rise to a non - gaussian quasi - quantized diffusion related to a hopping - type dynamics

the curves refer to gaussian fits over points near the origin ( solid lines ) and the tails ( dashed lines ) . ]    in ref .
@xcite it was shown that , in order to accurately describe the dynamics of a liquid crystal system , it is not sufficient to take into account the permanent barriers due to the long - range structure , but also the transient caging effect given by the surrounding particles . in this sense , the local fluid structure can affect the diffusion by determining dynamical heterogeneities which make the system deviate from gaussianity .
a careful analysis on the longitudinal component of the svhf in fig .
[ fig5 ] shows that this is indeed the case for the present columnar system .
in fact , if along the @xmath31 axis the diffusion was gaussian , it would be possible to fit the points in fig .
[ fig5 ] with a single gaussian function . on the contrary , by performing this fit on different intervals on the @xmath31 axis , i.e. in the region near the origin ( solid curve in figure ) and the tails ( dashed curve ) , one can observe that two different curves are obtained .
although in the present system the deviations between the two curves are small , this behavior manifests interesting resemblances with the heterogeneous dynamics of some amorphous systems , such as supercooled liquids and gels , where the two - gaussian fitting is used to distinguish between `` slow '' and `` fast '' particles @xcite . in this sense , one can affirm that in the longitudinal direction the diffusion can be regarded as that of a dilute supercooled liquid , more than a normal liquid .
the effect described so far should not be considered as strictly due to the columnar structure of the system , since analogous deviations are also observed in fig .
[ fig5]a for the nematic phase .
instead , the high packing fraction causes these small discrepancies from gaussian diffusion .

( [ eq5 ] ) and ( [ eq6 ] ) and reported in fig .
[ fig6 ] for @xmath120 , @xmath44 and @xmath124 . according to the definition given in eq .
( [ eq4 ] ) , at time @xmath125 the dvhf coincides with the pair distribution function , and it is thus characterized by a region around the origin where its value is equal to zero due to the excluded volume interaction .
on the other hand , in the limit @xmath126 the dvhf is expected to be a constant in a translationally homogeneous system due to the decay of the positional correlations ; this is not the case in presence of translational order , since the mutual position of two particles at different times is influenced by the permanent long - range structure of the whole system . at @xmath120 a region around the origin where the dvhf is close to zero suggests that each particle is still rattling around its initial position . beyond this region
a series of peaks indicate the preferential positions of the particles with respect to the one placed at the origin at the initial time . in the nematic phase at @xmath120 one can recognize in both the transverse ( fig . [ fig6]a ) and longitudinal ( fig .
[ fig6]e ) components the liquid - like structure of the system , where the lack of long - range order is testified by the rapid decay of the peaks by moving away from the origin .
one should also notice the speed at which the gap region around the origin is filled , giving rise to a dvhf almost constant already at @xmath121 .
therefore , during this time interval a given particle @xmath127 can escape the trapping cage formed by its nearest neighbors @xmath57 , and the space originally occupied by @xmath127 will be filled by one of the @xmath57 particles .
the situation changes appreciably when we pass to the columnar phase , where the long - range modulations in the transverse component of the dvhf ( fig .
[ fig6]b - d ) indicate the presence of a permanent structure . on the other hand , the longitudinal component ( fig .
[ fig6]f - h ) does not display any dramatic change in shape , but from its time evolution one can observe that the time a particle needs to leave its initial position increases considerably .
in fact , whereas the relaxation times of the longitudinal dvhf in the three systems manifesting columnar order are comparable ( fig .
[ fig6]f - h ) , one can notice a faster relaxation in the nematic phase ( fig .
[ fig6]e ) , which can not be due to the difference in packing fraction exclusively .
this seems to suggest that the inhomogeneous structure and the resulting dynamics in the transverse plane appreciably affect the dynamics in the longitudinal direction .
we argue that the higher in - plane mobility of the nematic phase with respect to the columnar affects the mobility along the nematic director albeit only slightly .
this is coherent with the results of ref .
@xcite , where a coupling between transverse and longitudinal diffusion in the smectic phase was pointed out .

we compare at @xmath21 the non - gaussian parameter averaged over the concentrations ( open circles ) with those relative to species @xmath42 ( dashed line ) , to species @xmath44 ( dotted line ) and of the whole system ( solid line ) . ]    an alternative way to analyze dynamical heterogeneities is to look for deviations from linearity of the mean square displacement .
the effect of local cage trapping in systems close to dynamical arrest and the presence of permanent long - range inhomogeneities as in liquid crystals manifest themselves in a region at intermediate times where the dynamics is strongly sub - diffusive . in fig .
[ fig7 ] we show the msd both in the @xmath29 plane and in the @xmath31 direction . in the plane perpendicular to the nematic director ( fig .
[ fig7]a ) one can appreciate the almost linear trend of the msd in the nematic phase , whereas by increasing the pressure and going to the columnar phase a plateau region appears , manifesting the development of a heterogeneous dynamics .
these deviations from linearity are tightly related to the non - gaussian behavior of the self - part of the van hove function , and can be quantitatively estimated by the non - gaussian parameter defined in eq .
( [ eq7 ] ) . in fig .
[ fig7bis ] we report the ngp in the @xmath29 plane averaged over the species concentrations as described in eq .
( [ eq7bis ] ) .
this parameter remains close to zero in the nematic phase , while it displays a peak at intermediate times in the columnar phase indicating deviations from gaussianity . on the other hand , along the @xmath31 direction
( not shown here ) the ngp does not deviate significantly from zero .
the choice of calculating the ngp for the whole system by averaging over the value it assumes for the two species separately allows to take into account just the effects related to the long - range structure of the system . for the sake of completeness
we show in the inset of fig .
[ fig7bis ] a comparison between the ngp at @xmath95 for each species , their weighted average and that corresponding to the whole system . as expected , the operation of average does not affect significantly the position of the peak , but decreases only the peak height , suggesting that in this way the non - gaussianity due to particle size difference is subtracted .
one should notice that this particular treatment is not necessary for the rest of the physical properties measured in this paper , since with the exception of the ngp they result to be linear in the particle species , i.e. their value for the system as a whole corresponds to a weighted average over the species .
the dynamic inhomogeneities as captured by both the msd and the ngp allow to identify three different time intervals . at short times
the msd follows the usual linear trend and the ngp maintains a value close to zero , which means that particles diffuse freely since they do not feel yet the trapping cage due to the surrounding particles . at intermediate times
the msd becomes strongly sub - diffusive and the ngp is characterized by a monotonic growth , thus meaning that the free diffusion is inhibited by the columnar structure of the fluid . at this stage
one can distinguish between particles which still rattle around the position of their column and others which succeeded in overcoming the energetic barrier and jumped to another column .
the end of the subdiffusive plateau and the return to the linear trend of the msd roughly correspond to the peak of the ngp , which starts decreasing monotonically to zero indicating the end of the caging regime , i.e. most of the particles succeeded in leaving their initial column
. a deeper inspection on the pressure dependence of the ngp shows that the degree of non - gaussianity , i.e. the height of the peak , and the duration of the caging regime , i.e. the position of the peak , increase with packing fraction .
this fact can be explained by considering that the cage escape is related to a rearrangement of the surrounding particles , which becomes slower at higher packing fraction as it involves more of them .
furthermore , the small deviations from linearity in the msd in the direction parallel to the nematic director confirm the presence of a weakly heterogeneous dynamics , as already pointed out by analyzing the self - part of the van hove function in this direction .

the data correspond to the same system and statepoints as in fig .
[ fig4]-[fig7bis ] .
the solid lines are fits ( see text ) . ]
finally , the structural relaxation of the system is analyzed in terms of the self - part of the intermediate scattering function ( sisf ) defined in eq .
( [ eq8 ] ) . whereas along the @xmath31 direction the relaxation is characterized by a single step decay at each pressure ( fig .
[ fig8]b ) , a plateau region , which characterizes the relaxation in the @xmath29 plane at intermediate times , develops in the columnar phase .
this plateau , whose value increases with pressure , indicates the time extension of the cage regime and is expected to divide a short - time decay ( @xmath135-relaxation ) from a long - time one ( @xmath136-relaxation ) . as previously observed in recent work on smectic liquid crystals @xcite and in out - of - equilibrium supercooled liquids @xcite , the sisf decays likely to zero at long times , indicating the loss of density auto - correlations .
this kind of behavior was described for the smectic phase in refs .
@xcite , where the @xmath136-relaxation decay was fitted by a stretched exponential function of the form @xmath137 $ ] with @xmath138 and @xmath139 the characteristic relaxation time . in the present simulations we did not observe any @xmath136-relaxation as the relaxation time of the systems exceeds probably our simulation time . on the other hand , from the data available a close accordance with the features of the structural relaxation of the smectic phase
can be observed . in particular , the @xmath135-relaxation in the @xmath29 plane is reasonably described by an exponential decay , as expected for simple liquids , due to the lack of interactions of the particles with the nearest neighbors at small times .
also the relaxation along the @xmath31 axis resembles accurately the relaxation of the smectic phase inside the smectic layers .
in fact , in both these cases the sisf depends weakly on the pressure and it is characterized by an exponential decay at small times , which eventually becomes a stretched exponential with @xmath138 . in this sense
we can confirm what the authors observed in ref .
@xcite , i.e. the relaxation of a liquid crystal in the direction(s ) in which the system is homogeneous is closer to that of a low - density supercooled liquid , than a simple liquid , where instead an exponential relaxation is to be expected .
in summary , we used monte carlo simulations to analyze for the first time the presence of dynamical heterogeneities in a columnar liquid crystal of perfectly aligned hard spherocylinders .
the long - range hexagonal order in the plane perpendicular to the nematic director determines an effective mean - field potential , whose effect is to maintain particles inside a column preventing them to occupy a position in between the columns . in analogy with previous analyses on the smectic phase , the height of the energetic barriers of this effective potential increases with the packing fraction and the particle anisotropy . as a consequence , in the @xmath29 plane the dynamics of a rod
is characterized by a quasi - quantized behavior in which particles rattle around the position of the column and jump to another column only when the configuration of the surrounding particles allows it .
the rattling - and - jumping dynamics in the in - plane evolution of the system gives rise to three different time regimes . at very short times , the particles diffuse almost freely because they do not feel yet the presence of the trapping cage formed by their surrounding nearest neighbors . at this stage
the behavior of the system is that typical of a simple fluid , characterized by a gaussian distribution of displacements , a linear mean square displacement and a fast exponential structural relaxation .
a second stage starts when particles begin experiencing the cage due to the long - range structure of the system , in such a way that the diffusion results to be inhibited and only occasionally a column - to - column jump takes place and is made possible by the instantaneous configuration of the system . as a result , the mean square displacement as well as the self - intermediate scattering function develop a plateau , which testifies the slowing down of the dynamics and whose time extension increases with packing fraction . on the other hand ,
the distribution of displacements show marked deviations from gaussianity due to the appearance of peaks which correspond to the lattice positions in the plane .
nonetheless , after longer time intervals the number of `` fast '' particles , which succeeded in overcoming the energetic barrier , increases with respect to the `` slow '' ones .
consequently , when most of the particles succeeded in leaving their initial column , a second diffusive regime starts , indicating the end of the cage regime .
we observed interesting analogies with the dynamics in smectic phases by considering the in - column dynamics .
in fact , along the direction defined by the nematic director , the system does not develop any long - range order , and it is thus expected to behave like a liquid . on the other hand , we noticed interesting , although slight , deviations from gaussian diffusion both in the distribution of displacements and in the mean square displacement .
as far as the structural relaxation is concerned , this fact is testified by a self - intermediate scattering function well approximated by a stretched - exponential , as it happens in dense liquids . in this sense
we confirm previous studies on the smectic phase , that along the direction in which a liquid crystal does not develop any long - range order the dynamics is similar to a dense liquid .
these results are to be compared with recent experiments on the columnar phase of a suspension of _ fd _ virus particles @xcite , where huge discrepancies from gaussianity were observed along the nematic director .
we argue that the higher length - to - diameter ratio , the flexibility or the charge of the rods could account for a more pronounced non - gaussian diffusive behavior than what was observed in the present study .
it is a pleasure to thank m. p. lettinga , e. grelet and e. pouget for sharing preliminary experimental results that motivated this work and d. el masri and p. van der schoot for stimulating discussions .
this work is financed by a nwo - vici grant and is part of the research program of the `` stichting door fundamenteel onderzoek der materie ( fom ) '' , which is financially supported by the `` nederlandse organisatie voor wetenschappelijk onderzoek ( nwo ) '' ." ," in the wake of previous studies on the rattling - and - jumping diffusion in smectic liquid crystal phases of colloidal rods , we analyze here for the first time the heterogeneous dynamics in columnar phases . more specifically , we perform computer simulations to investigate the relaxation dynamics of a binary mixture of perfectly aligned hard spherocylinders . 
 we detect that the columnar arrangement of the system produces free - energy barriers the particles should overcome to jump from one column to another , thus determining a hopping - type diffusion . 
 this phenomenon accounts for the non - gaussian inter - column diffusion and shows a two - step structural relaxation which is remarkably analogous to that of out - of - equilibrium glass - forming systems and gels . 
 surprisingly enough , slight deviations from the behavior of simple liquids due to transient cages is also observed in the direction perpendicular to this plane , where the system is usually referred to as liquid - like . "
"one of the most famous algebraic operads of topological origin is the operad of gerstenhaber algebras , which is the homology operad of the topological operad of little @xmath4-disks  @xcite .
the @xmath5 component of the operad of little @xmath4-discs is homotopy equivalent to the configuration space of @xmath6 ordered points in  @xmath7 whose fundamental group is the pure braid group on @xmath6 strands .
one natural way to generalise braid groups is to consider configurations of subsets that have more interesting topology than points .
the simplest example of these `` higher - dimensional '' versions of braid groups is given by `` groups of loops '' , the @xmath8 one being the group of motions of @xmath9 unknotted unlinked circles in  @xmath10 bringing each circle to its original position .
alternatively , these groups can be viewed as groups of pure symmetric automorphisms of the free group with @xmath9 generators , that is automorphisms sending each generator to an element of its conjugacy class .
the integral cohomology of these groups was computed by jensen , mccammond and meier in  @xcite ; that paper also contains references and historical information on this group . the description of the cohomology algebras in  @xcite looks very similar to that for pure braid groups  @xcite .
moreover , as a symmetric collection , the collection of cohomology algebras is isomorphic to @xmath11 which bears striking resemblance with the isomorphism @xmath12 for the operad of gerstenhaber algebras .
however , there is no natural operad structure on the collection of homology groups of the groups of loops .    in @xcite ,
the second author computed the cohomology of the groups of pure symmetric automorphisms in a different way , as a particular case of a much more general result : for an arbitrary @xmath9-tuple of groups @xmath13 , he computed the cohomology of the fouxe - rabinovitch group @xmath14 of partial conjugation automorphisms of the free product @xmath15 .
for that , he used a construction of a classifying space of that group via a moduli space of `` cactus products '' of the classifying spaces @xmath16 . in the case
when @xmath17 , these spaces form a symmetric collection , but alas do not form a topological operad either . however , it turns out that they admit a slight modification that carries a structure of a topological operad ; the required change is that one of the spaces @xmath18 is chosen as the base and is required to sit at the root of each cactus .
we call the modified space the space of based @xmath2-cacti
. the goal of this paper is to understand the algebra and topology of this operad .    for homology with coefficients in a field
, we show that the homology operad of the operad of based @xmath2-cacti is obtained from the homology coalgebra of @xmath2 by a formal algebraic procedure that only uses the augmentation and the coproduct ; thus , it is defined for every graded cocommutative coalgebra  @xmath1 , not necessarily the homology coalgebra of a topological space .
remarkably , for every coalgebra @xmath1 this defined operad is koszul . to prove that , we use filtered distributive laws between operads , as defined by the second author in  @xcite .
one immediate consequence of our results is that , for @xmath19 , the homology operad of based @xmath2-cacti is isomorphic , as an @xmath20-module , to @xmath21 , which , given that the operad of associative permutative algebras @xmath22 encodes commutative algebras with additional structure , may be naturally thought of as an `` operad - compatible improvement '' of the result of  @xcite mentioned above .
our constructions are defined over a field of arbitrary characteristic , and our results on operads of based cacti hold in that generality .
however , even the distributive law criterion for koszulness , let alone its filtered generalisation , has only been available in zero characteristic , since the known proofs @xcite rely on the knneth formula for symmetric collections .
using the shuffle operads technique @xcite , we were able to obtain a characteristic - independent proof of this criterion .
the paper is organised as follows . in section
[ sec : background ] , we recall necessary background information that we use throughout the paper . in section
[ sec : top_cacti ] , we define the topological operads of based cacti and discuss its connections both with automorphism groups of free products and with other known topological operads . the homology operad for the operad of based cacti
is computed in section  [ sec : homology ] . in section  [ sec : distr - laws ] , we discuss filtered distributive laws between quadratic operads .
section  [ sec : koszul ] shows how to use filtered distributive laws to prove the koszul property for the linear operads of based cacti , and also discuss its applications to the operad of post - lie algebras and the operad of commutative tridendriform algebras .

we refer the reader to the book  @xcite , for details on grbner bases for operads   to the paper  @xcite . in this section we only recall the key notions used throughout the paper . by an operad ( enriched in a symmetric monoidal category  @xmath23 ) we mean a monoid in one of the two monoidal categories : the category of symmetric @xmath48-collections equipped with the composition product or the category of nonsymmetric @xmath48-collections equipped with the shuffle composition product . the former kind of monoids is referred to as symmetric operads , the latter   as shuffle operads .
we always assume that our collections are reduced , that is , have no elements of arity  @xmath40 .
a good rule of thumb is that all operads defined in this paper are symmetric operads , but for computational purposes it is useful to treat them as shuffle operads .
this does not lose any information except for the symmetric group actions , since the forgetful functor @xmath59 is monoidal and one - to - one on objects ( and therefore for tasks that can be formulated without the symmetric group actions , e.g. computing bases and dimensions of components , proving the koszul property etc .
, we can choose arbitrarily whether to work with a symmetric operad or with its shuffle version ) . in the `` geometric '' setting
, @xmath48 will usually be the category of sets , or topological spaces , or pointed topological spaces , in the `` linear '' setting   the category of vector spaces ( in which case symmetric collections are usually called @xmath20-modules ) , or the category of graded vector spaces or chain complexes ( in which case symmetric collections are called differential graded @xmath20-modules ) .
a linear symmetric operad can also be thought as of collection of spaces of operations of some type , and therefore can be defined via its category of algebras , i.e. vector spaces where these operations act , via identities between operations acting on a vector space .    in the linear setting , a very useful technical tool for dealing with ( shuffle ) operads is given by grbner bases .
more precisely , similarly to associative algebras , operads can be presented via generators and relations , that is as quotients of free operads @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the space of generators .
the free shuffle operad generated by a given nonsymmetric collection admits a basis of `` tree monomials '' which can be defined combinatorially ; a shuffle composition of tree monomials is again a tree monomial .
in addition to the `` arity '' of elements of a free operad , there is the notion of weight , similar to grading for associative algebras : we define the weight of a tree monomial as the number of generators used in this tree monomial .
weight is well behaved under composition : when composing several tree monomials , the weight of the result is equal to the sum of their weights .
for an arbitrary operad  @xmath62 whose relations @xmath63 are weight - homogeneous , the weight descends from the free operad @xmath60 on  @xmath64 ; the subcollection of  @xmath64 consisting of all elements of weight  @xmath6 is denoted by  @xmath65 .
there exist several ways to introduce a total ordering of tree monomials in such a way that the operadic compositions are compatible with that total ordering .
there is also a combinatorial definition of divisibility of tree monomials that agrees with the naive operadic definition : one tree monomial occurs as a subtree in another one if and only if the latter can be obtained from the former by operadic compositions .
a grbner basis of an ideal @xmath66 of the free operad is a system @xmath67 of generators of  @xmath66 for which the leading monomial of every element of the ideal is divisible by one of the leading terms of elements of  @xmath67 .
such a system of generators allows to perform `` long division '' modulo  @xmath66 , computing for every element its canonical representative .
there exists an algorithmic way to compute a grbner basis starting from any given system of generators ( `` buchberger s algorithm for shuffle operads '' ) .
a part of the operad theory which provides one of the most useful known tools to study homological and homotopical algebra for algebras over the given operad is the koszul duality for operads  @xcite . proving that a given operad is koszul instantly provides a minimal resolution for this operad , gives a description of the homology theory and , in particular , the deformation theory for algebras over that operad etc .
there are a few general methods to prove that an operad is koszul ; one of the simplest and widely applicable methods  @xcite is to show that a given operad has a quadratic grbner basis ( as a shuffle operad ) ; this provides a sufficient ( but not necessary ) condition for koszulness of an operad .
if an operad is koszul , it necessarily is _ quadratic _ , that is has weight - homogeneous relations of weight  @xmath4 .
the operads that serve as `` building blocks '' for operads considered throughout the paper are mostly well known : @xmath68 ( commutative associative algebras ) , @xmath69 ( lie algebras ) , @xmath70 ( associative algebras ) , @xmath71 ( leibniz algebras  @xcite ) , @xmath72 ( zinbiel algebras  @xcite ) , @xmath22 ( [ associative ] permutative algebras  @xcite ) , @xmath73 ( nonassociative permutative algebras  @xcite , closely related to `` right - commutative magma ''  @xcite ) .
all these operads are koszul , and have a quadratic grbner basis .      as we said before ,
some of our constructions exist both in a `` geometric '' and a `` linear '' setting , and are related to each other via the homology functor ( which assigns to a topological space @xmath2 the graded cocommutative coalgebra  @xmath3 ) . to make additional structures transfer easily , we use basic concepts of the theory of polynomial functors .
a polynomial functor is a notion that categorifies the notion of a polynomial , and more generally of a formal power series .
polynomial functors provide a useful uniform language to deal with categorical constructions that have `` a polynomial flavour '' , e.g. when computing sums and products in appropriate categories over specified sets indexing summands / factors in a way that keeps track of the intrinsic structure of the indexing sets .    in precise words , a diagram of sets and
set maps @xmath74 gives rise to a polynomial functor @xmath75 defined by the formula @xmath76 here @xmath77 and @xmath78 denote , respectively , the right adjoint and the left adjoint of the pullback functor  @xmath79 .
more explicitly , the functor is given by @xmath80 \longmapsto \sum_{b\in b } \prod_{e\in p^{-1}(b ) } f^{-1}(s(e)),\ ] ] where the last set is considered to be over @xmath81 via @xmath82 .
here one can replace @xmath83 by another category where all the appropriate notions make sense . for our purposes
, it is enough to consider the case @xmath84 , in which case the corresponding functors were referred to as polynomial functors in @xcite , and are called polynomial functors in one variable in more recent literature .    for a systematic introduction to polynomial functors ,
we refer the reader to the paper  @xcite and the notes  @xcite that reflect the state - of - art of the theory .
let @xmath2 be a set and let @xmath86 be the set of @xmath2-trees with vertex set @xmath87}={{\left\{1{,\ldots,}n\right\}}}$ ] .
when @xmath2 is a singleton set this is just the set of rooted trees which we denote @xmath88 .
the symmetric group @xmath89 acts on @xmath86 by permuting elements of the vertex set . for a given rooted tree
the set of @xmath2-labellings is equal to @xmath90 .
since the number of edges of a tree on @xmath91 is always @xmath92 , the set of @xmath2-labellings is in turn isomorphic to @xmath93 .
hence @xmath94 in this way if @xmath2 is a topological space then we may also apply a topology to @xmath86 using the product topology on @xmath93 .
now let @xmath95 and @xmath96 and @xmath97}$ ] .
we may define a composition @xmath98 by first identifying the root of @xmath99 with the vertex @xmath100 in @xmath101 .
this is a tree and may be rooted by taking the root of @xmath101 .
the edge set is equal to the union @xmath102 of the edge sets of @xmath101 and @xmath99 and so one inherits an edge labelling by elements of @xmath2 .
it has the vertex set @xmath103 we then relabel the vertices by elements of @xmath104}$ ] using the isomorphism which fixes @xmath105 , shifts the set @xmath106 to @xmath107 and shifts @xmath108 to @xmath109 .

the only complication is that when two trees are composed their vertices are renumbered : this change is taken into account in the right hand side of each equation . in both cases
the edge set of the resulting tree is the union of the edge sets of the three component trees , hence the @xmath2-labellings on both sides of each equation are equal .
it remains to make the routine check that the vertex labels in each side of each equation agree , this is no more complicated than the analogous check in the associative operad .
now we show that the operad is generated by operations of arity @xmath4 .

[ rem_polynomial ] the operads @xmath85 are functorial in sets @xmath2 , in fact @xmath136 is a polynomial functor given by the diagram @xmath137 both the operad maps and the proof above work on the level of the polynomial itself , hence for any appropriate category one may use the polynomial to give a family of operads @xmath138 .
for instance this means that if @xmath2 is also equipped with a topology then @xmath134 is a topological operad . in section  [ sec : homology ] we will consider the operads @xmath139 where @xmath140 is a graded vector space .
when @xmath2 is a single point @xmath141 , the operad @xmath85 is the usual operad  @xmath73 .
let us finish this section with a few words on @xmath134-algebras .
one convenient way to think of them is via the `` right regular module '' , since the defining relations say that all the right multiplications @xmath142^y}}}(a , b)\ ] ] commute with each other .
somewhat more precisely , let @xmath143 be an object in a symmetric monoidal category  @xmath48 , and let @xmath144 be a map whose image is an abelian submonoid .
then @xmath143 is a @xmath134-algebra enriched in  @xmath48 with the structure maps given by @xmath145^y}}}(a , b)=f(y , b).a.\ ] ] this way to approach @xmath134-algebras gives a source of examples based on @xmath22-algebras with a family of maps as follows .
[ ex : nap - from - perm ] let @xmath146 be a @xmath22-algebra encriched in a symmetric monoidal category @xmath48 , and let @xmath147 , @xmath148 be a family of maps in @xmath149 ( note that these maps may be arbitrary , not necessarily algebra homomorphisms ) . then @xmath143 is a @xmath134-algebra enriched in  @xmath48 with the structure maps given by @xmath150^y}}}(a , b)=a\cdot g_y(b).\ ] ]    one more observation we want to mention in this section is that the construction of the free @xmath73-algebra mentioned in  @xcite admits an immediate generalisation to the case of @xmath134-algebras : the free @xmath134-algebra enriched in @xmath83 with the generating set  @xmath35 admits a realisation as the set of @xmath2-trees whose vertices carry labels from  @xmath35 , with the product defined in the same way as we defined the composition in the operad : @xmath151^y}}}(a , b)=({\vcenter{\xymatrix@c=0.6pc@r=0.6pc{2\\1\ar[u]^y}}}\circ_1 a)\circ_2 b.\ ] ] in this composition the root of @xmath152 is joined to the root of @xmath153 by an edge labelled by @xmath127 ; the new root is taken to be the root of @xmath153 .
let @xmath35 be a set and @xmath28 be a @xmath35-tuple of pointed spaces .
let @xmath34 be a @xmath28-tree with root @xmath154 and suppose that @xmath37 is an edge of @xmath34 where @xmath155 .
suppose further that @xmath37 is labelled by the basepoint @xmath156 .
then we say that @xmath37 is a _
reducible edge _ and that @xmath34 is _
reducible_. since @xmath100 is not the root there is a unique incoming edge @xmath157 which is labelled by some @xmath158 . we define @xmath159 to be the @xmath28-tree given by removing the edge @xmath37 and adding the edge @xmath160 with the label @xmath158 .
we say that @xmath159 is a _ reduction _ of @xmath34 .
let @xmath35 be a finite set and @xmath28 be a @xmath35-tuple of pointed spaces .
then the space of _ based @xmath28-cacti _ , @xmath161 is the topological space given by quotienting out by the relation @xmath162 for any @xmath34 with a reducible edge @xmath37 .
now let @xmath163 be the set @xmath164 and let @xmath165 be the @xmath163-tuple given by adjoining @xmath166 to the @xmath35-tuple @xmath28 .
then we define the space of @xmath28-cacti , @xmath167 to be the subspace of @xmath168 consisting of the trees with root @xmath40 .    for each @xmath28-cactus @xmath169 one may define the space @xmath170 where @xmath171 is the label of the edge @xmath37 and @xmath172 is the basepoint of @xmath173 .
note that this realisation is invariant across equivalences @xmath162 . if each space @xmath18 is path connected then this space is homotopy equivalent to the wedge product of the spaces @xmath174 for @xmath175 .
these spaces are called _ cactus products _ and were studied by the second author in  @xcite .
there it was shown that the space @xmath167 of such products has interesting homotopical properties , in particular if the spaces @xmath18 are classifying spaces for groups @xmath176 then @xmath167 is a classifying space for the fouxe - rabinovitch group @xmath14 of partial conjugation automorphisms of the free product @xmath177 .
an example of a cactus product : @xmath178{cactusproduct}}}\ ] ] note that if @xmath179 is the root of the tree @xmath34 then the space @xmath174 must always be at the ` base ' of the diagram .
the appearance of the diagram explains the term ` based @xmath28-cactus ' .
we also see the reason for adjoining a point space @xmath180 ; this removes the base space ; the space @xmath180 acts as a basepoint .
recall that the level of a rooted tree is the number of non - trivial directed paths . when @xmath157 and @xmath37 are edges of a rooted tree @xmath34 , the rooted tree @xmath130 given by removing @xmath37 and then adding @xmath160 has strictly lesser level .
indeed if @xmath181 is the unique path joining vertices @xmath179 and @xmath31 in @xmath130 , then there is a unique path joining @xmath179 and @xmath31 in @xmath34 .
but the number of paths in @xmath34 is strictly larger because there is a path joining @xmath100 and @xmath125 in @xmath34 but not in @xmath130 .
so for any @xmath28-tree @xmath34 one may use the reductions @xmath162 repeatly until there are no reducible edges remaining .
since the level reduces each time this process must terminate .
it is easy to check that it does not matter what order the reductions @xmath162 are applied because if @xmath182 and @xmath183 are two reducible edges then @xmath184 . hence for each @xmath2-labelled tree there is a unique equivalent tree which can not be reduced any further .
therefore @xmath161 is isomorphic to the set of irreducible @xmath28-trees .
let @xmath55 be a pointed space . for @xmath185
, we define the space @xmath186 to be the space of based cacti on the @xmath9-tuple @xmath187 .
the action of @xmath89 on @xmath188 makes this into a symmetric collection .
[ thm : bcyoperad ] let @xmath55 be a pointed space .
the equivalence relation @xmath189 generated by reductions @xmath162 is compatible with the operad maps of @xmath85 .
hence the quotient collection @xmath190 has an operad structure inherited from @xmath85 .
furthermore the equivalence relation @xmath189 is generated as an operad ideal by the single relation @xmath191_{\bullet}\\ 1\ar[u]_y } } } \quad=\quad { \vcenter{\xymatrix@c=0.6pc@r=0.6pc{2 & & 3 \\ & 1\ar[ul]^y \ar[ur]_y & } } } .\ ] ]    let @xmath126 be a @xmath2-tree with reducible edge @xmath37 ; let @xmath192 be any other @xmath2-tree .

the edge @xmath37 still exists in each product although it may have been relabelled , to @xmath196 say .

furthermore @xmath198 is not the root in either product so @xmath196 is a reducible edge giving the reductions @xmath199 the reductions are also closed under the symmetric actions : for @xmath200 the edge @xmath201 is reducible in @xmath202 .
this shows the first part and in particular that @xmath190 is an operad .

we may assume that @xmath204 , @xmath205 and @xmath206 .
the essential idea of the proof is that since   is a subtree , the tree @xmath34 may be written as a composition of   and other @xmath2-trees . removing the edges @xmath207 and @xmath208 from @xmath34 leaves three connected components ; @xmath101 contains @xmath43 , @xmath99 contains @xmath4 and @xmath117 contains @xmath209 . in effect
we have partitioned the edge set of @xmath34 into @xmath210 , @xmath211 , @xmath212 and @xmath213 .

the corollary  [ cor : napyquadratic ] to theorem  [ thm : nap - koszul ] states that @xmath134 is binary quadratic .
along with the theorem above this shows that @xmath190 is also binary quadratic .    in the spirit of how we approached @xmath134-algebras , a @xmath216-algebra enriched in a symmetric monoidal category
@xmath48 is a @xmath134-algebra enriched in  @xmath48 where the operation @xmath217_{\bullet}}}}$ ] is associative , and @xmath218_{\bullet}}}}(a , b))=f(y , a)\circ f(y , b).\ ] ]      let @xmath2 be a topological space and let @xmath181 be a subset of @xmath2 .
we define the fundamental groupoid @xmath219 to be the groupoid with objects the points @xmath220 and morphisms the homotopy classes of paths in @xmath2 which start and end in elements of @xmath181 .
the composition is by concatenation of paths and the units are supplied by the constant paths .
so if @xmath55 is a pointed space then @xmath221 is the fundamental group of @xmath2 .
let @xmath55 be a pointed space and let @xmath222 be a set of points which contains @xmath197 and such that each path connected component of @xmath2 contains a single point of @xmath181 .
this may be seen as a section of the map @xmath223 then by the functoriality of @xmath224 there is a pair of operad maps @xmath225 & { { \textrm{\textsc{bcact}}}}_p , \ar@<0.5ex>[l]}\ ] ] which serves to pick out a single element in each path connected component of @xmath190 .
the fundamental groupoid functor preserves products and colimits and so @xmath226 is an operad in the category of groupoids .    from now on we will restrict @xmath2 to be a path connected space , so @xmath227 . in this case
@xmath228 , the operad for permutative algebras   each of the @xmath9 elements is given by a corolla .
so we see that @xmath186 is made up of @xmath9 components and the action of @xmath89 gives isomorphisms between them .
denote by @xmath229 the component consisting of trees with root @xmath230 .
[ prop : bcygroupoid ] the fundamental group of @xmath231 is presented by generators @xmath232 for @xmath113 , @xmath233 with @xmath234 and @xmath235 , along with relations @xmath236 @xmath237}=e\ ] ] for distinct @xmath100 , @xmath125 , @xmath6 ; @xmath238}=e\ ] ] for distinct @xmath100 , @xmath125 , @xmath6 , @xmath239 ; and @xmath240}=e\ ] ] for distinct @xmath100 , @xmath125 , @xmath6 .
we defined the cactus operads @xmath190 by adding certain relations @xmath162 for trees @xmath34 with a reducible edge @xmath37 .
the relations come in families : for a fixed tree @xmath34 with a fixed edge @xmath37 where @xmath100 is not the root , a @xmath2-tree is reducible if @xmath37 is labelled by the point @xmath241 and the remaining @xmath242 edges are labelled by any element in @xmath2 , so there is a family of relations parametrised by @xmath243 .
each element in this family encodes a reduction @xmath162 : there is one map from @xmath244 corresponding to @xmath34 and another map from @xmath244 corresponding to @xmath159 . for the second map the diagonal @xmath245
is used to define the new labelling .
so for each such tree @xmath34 with edge @xmath37 there are a pair of maps @xmath246\ar@<-.5ex>[r ] & { { \textrm{\textsc{nap}}}}_y(n).}\ ] ] in identifying the two images of each point we are taking the coequaliser of this diagram .
but we have such an identification for each tree @xmath34 with an edge @xmath37 where @xmath100 is not the root .
so we have a diagram with a copy of @xmath244 for each such pair @xmath247 and two arrows from each copy to a single copy of @xmath248 .
the colimit of this diagram is the space given by making all identifications @xmath162  that is , the colimit is @xmath186 .
we will use @xmath249 to denote the group @xmath219 .
the fundamental groupoid functor @xmath250 respects colimits and products , so in particular respects polynomial functors meaning that @xmath251 .
furthermore @xmath252 is given by the colimit of the diagram which consists of a single copy of @xmath253 and a copy of @xmath254 for each pair @xmath247 .
it now remains to compute this colimit .    restricting ourselves to trees with root @xmath43 ,
we have that @xmath231 is the colimit of the diagram where @xmath248 is replaced by @xmath255 and we only include pairs @xmath247 where the root of @xmath34 is 1 .
since @xmath256 is a single point , @xmath257 is connected and @xmath258 has a single object and so may be viewed as a group .
we will now examine the effect of coequalisers on morphisms .
a generic morphism of @xmath259 consists of a rooted tree @xmath260 with edge labels @xmath261 for each @xmath262 .
but since such elements belong to a component of @xmath263 isomorphic to @xmath264 they can be rewritten as the product of @xmath92 elements , one for each edge .
the element corresponding to @xmath262 is given by labelling edge @xmath265 by @xmath266 and every other edge of @xmath34 by the identity .
we will denote such an element by @xmath267 , which is the tree @xmath34 with edge @xmath37 labelled by @xmath268 .
the coequalisers encode reductions just as before .
let @xmath269 be a generator where @xmath268 , @xmath260 and @xmath270 is any edge .
let @xmath37 be another edge , this time we ask that @xmath100 is not the root @xmath43 ; this will be the edge we will reduce over .
as before let @xmath157 be the unique incoming edge to @xmath100 and let @xmath159 be the tree given by cutting @xmath37 and adding @xmath160 .
the element @xmath271 may be reduced when the label of @xmath37 is the identity , that is if @xmath272 : in the case that @xmath273 the reduced tree has edges @xmath157 and @xmath160 labelled by @xmath274 and the remaining edges labelled by the identity . in all other cases the single edge @xmath157 is labelled by @xmath274 with the remaining edges labelled by the identity .
so if @xmath273 we have @xmath275 and otherwise @xmath276 . remember that @xmath37 must be a reducible edge .
the reductions above allow ( using the fact that reduction reduces the level ) any element in @xmath277 to be written as a product of elements @xmath267 where @xmath34 is a tree with no identity labelled reducible edges .
the possibilities are that @xmath34 is a corolla and so @xmath278 , or that @xmath34 is the tree with @xmath242 edges emanating from the root @xmath43 and the only other edge being @xmath37 .
so for each pair @xmath279 where @xmath280}$ ] , @xmath234 and @xmath281 , there is a unique tree @xmath34 such that the pair @xmath247 is irreducible .
therefore we may denote the element @xmath267 by @xmath232 and these elements generate the group @xmath282 .
let @xmath283 , @xmath37 be any edge and @xmath268 , we may write the element @xmath267 as a monomial in the generators above as follows . let @xmath284 be the set of vertices @xmath179 which may be joined by a directed path from @xmath100 to @xmath179 starting in the edge @xmath37
. then @xmath267 reduces to the product @xmath285    it remains to find the relations between the generators .
some of the relations are contributed by the components of @xmath259 corresponding to the irreducible pairs @xmath247 .
the relations @xmath286 come from their respective components , these account for  .
then there are the relations @xmath287 $ ] for @xmath234 , which exist in the component of @xmath259 corresponding to the corolla , these account for some of the relations in  , specifically the relations for @xmath278 .
denote by @xmath288 the tree with edges @xmath289 for @xmath290 and edge @xmath37 , then this contributes the relations @xmath291}=e.\ ] ] but the second element is reducible : in the case @xmath292 it reduces to @xmath293 , whilst in the case @xmath294 it reduces to @xmath295 .
however these are not all of the relations , additional commutation relations come from other trees @xmath34 .
let @xmath296 be the tree with the edges @xmath37 and @xmath297 and edges @xmath298 for @xmath299 .
this tree encodes commutator brackets @xmath300}=e,\ ] ] the elements reduce to @xmath232 and @xmath301 respectively .
similarly for distinct @xmath302 let @xmath303 be the tree with edges @xmath37 and @xmath304 and edges @xmath305 for @xmath306 ; as above this encodes a commutator relation : @xmath307}={\left[\alpha^g_{ij},\alpha^h_{kl}\right ] } = e.\ ] ] finally let @xmath308 be the tree with edges @xmath37 and @xmath309 and edges @xmath298 for @xmath299 .
this tree gives the commutator relations @xmath310}=e.\ ] ] the second element reduces to @xmath311 and the first to the product @xmath312 .
this accounts for all of the relations in the statement of the proposition .    to show that the stated relations are sufficient to present the group we need to show that the commutator relations @xmath313}=e\ ] ] hold for each tree @xmath34 and each pair of edges @xmath314
let @xmath284 and @xmath315 be the sets of vertices which index the respective decompositions of the form  . if @xmath284 and @xmath315 are disjoint then commutator relations of the form   and   show that all the constituent irreducible elements commute with one another . in the case that @xmath284 and @xmath315
do intersect there must be either a directed path from @xmath100 to @xmath6 or from @xmath6 to @xmath100 .
assuming the former we find that @xmath284 contains @xmath315 .
we now show that each @xmath316 for @xmath317 commutes with @xmath267 .
since both @xmath6 and @xmath179 are in @xmath284 the element @xmath318 is a term in @xmath267 , the relation   means that @xmath316 commutes with this term .
the remaining terms are of the form @xmath319 for @xmath320 which also commutes with @xmath316
. therefore @xmath316 commutes with the element @xmath267 ; and therefore @xmath321 commutes with it as well .
therefore the relations  - suffice to present @xmath282 .
we have already seen that @xmath322 is an operad , to give the composition maps we need only describe the compositions on the generating morphisms .
in fact since we have @xmath323 we need only describe the compositions of generators with identity maps .
let @xmath55 be a path connected pointed space and let @xmath249 be its fundamental group . the operad structure on @xmath322 is given on generating morphisms as follows : let @xmath324 and @xmath325 be the identity morphism . for @xmath326}$ ] define @xmath327 and @xmath328
, then we have @xmath329 for @xmath330}$ ] define @xmath331 to be @xmath100 if @xmath332 , to be @xmath333 if @xmath334 and @xmath335 if @xmath336 ; define @xmath337 similarly . for each @xmath194}$ ] define @xmath338 to be @xmath339 .
then we have @xmath340    let @xmath341 be the tree with root @xmath230 , the edge @xmath37 and @xmath342 edges @xmath343 ( if @xmath344 then this is a corolla )
. then @xmath232 is represented by the tree @xmath341 with @xmath37 labelled by @xmath268 .
let @xmath345 be the corolla with root @xmath346 and @xmath347 edges @xmath348 .
when all of the edges are labelled by the identity @xmath349 then this represents the identity @xmath265 of @xmath350 .    to compute @xmath351 we compose trees to get @xmath352 and then reduce using equation  .
the unique labelled edge @xmath37 of @xmath341 is a leaf and hence it is also a leaf of @xmath352 , although now the edge is @xmath196 . since it is a leaf it reduces to @xmath353 as required .    to compute @xmath354 is a little more complicated as it depends on the value of @xmath152 .
if @xmath355 then the leaf @xmath37 is still a leaf of @xmath356 and so the same argument applies to give the reduction to @xmath357 .
however if @xmath358 then the tree consists of the edge @xmath359 , another @xmath242 edges emanating from the root and @xmath347 edges @xmath360 .
the only labelled edge is @xmath359 and the set @xmath284 of vertices ` above @xmath100 ' consists of the vertex @xmath361 and the vertices @xmath338 for each edge @xmath362 .
an application of equation   serves to finish the proof .
the groups @xmath363 act faithfully on the free product @xmath364 .
we will write this free product as @xmath365 where each group is isomorphic to @xmath249 in order to distinguish between different factors .
the element @xmath366 acts on the factors as follows @xmath367 in  @xcite the closely related spaces of unbased cacti @xmath167 were studied and it was shown that when @xmath18 is a classifying space for @xmath176 then @xmath167 is itself a classifying space for a certain group of automorphisms . as a consequence of theorems  [ thm : homology - bcy ] and  [ thm : cacti - koszul ] we see that @xmath368 whereas in  @xcite it is shown that @xmath369 this last isomorphism could also be shown using the methods of reduction used in this paper , although @xmath370 is not an operad .
the pure braid group on @xmath9 strands , @xmath371 is known to be a subgroup of the group @xmath372 of partial conjugations of the free group on @xmath9 letters .
this inclusion may be realised by a construction involving cacti . in  @xcite various ( quasi-)operads of cacti
are discussed ; these are different to the operad @xmath373 in that the cacti are planar and unbased
. we will take @xmath374 to be the spineless and normalised varieties of cacti from  @xcite .
this quasi - operad is quasi - isomorphic to the little discs operad and so in particular the fundamental group @xmath375 is the pure braid group @xmath371 .
there is an @xmath89-equivariant map @xmath376 defined by the map which forgets the planar structure of a planar cactus leaving a cactus product of circles as defined in  ; on fundamental groups this gives the inclusion @xmath377 .
the operad compositions of @xmath373 and @xmath374 are not closely related , this may be seen by examining the homology operads which are @xmath378 as defined in the next section and the gerstenhaber operad @xmath379 .
however both families of cacti are related by a third operad which ` contains ' both .
let @xmath380 be the space of smooth , disjoint embeddings of @xmath9 copies of the filled in torus , or _
ring _ @xmath381 into itself   this is naturally an operad .
the little discs operad consists of disjoint embeddings of copies of a disc @xmath382 into itself and can be mapped into the little rings operad @xmath383 by applying @xmath384 to the embeddings .
the image of the little discs operad involves little rings which wind around the large ring once .
meanwhile the operad @xmath373 is related to the connected components of embeddings in which one little ring , the _ root _ winds around the large ring once ; the remaining rings do not wind around the large ring and all of the rings are unknotted and unlinked .
the fundamental groups of these connected components contain @xmath385 as a suboperad .
there are additional elements not in the suboperad given by little rings circling through the large ring along with smooth endomorphisms of @xmath386 .
so far we have described operads @xmath85 and @xmath190 in the `` geometric '' setting .
both families also have versions existing in the `` linear '' setting , so for any graded vector space @xmath140 there exists an operad @xmath139 , whereas in the case of the based cacti there is a subtlety , we require a graded augmented cocommutative coalgebra @xmath1 to define @xmath387 .
the `` geometric '' and `` linear '' versions are closely related via the homology functor which sends a topological space to its homology groups with coefficients in the base field @xmath26 . in this section , we shall describe these operads via constructions with decorated rooted trees , and later in section  [ sec : koszul ] , we shall descibe them via generators and relations , and show that it in fact each of them has a quadratic grbner basis of relations .      let @xmath140 be a graded vector space ( over some field @xmath26 ) . recall that in   we described @xmath86 as disjoint union of direct products of copies of @xmath2 .
then in remark  [ rem_polynomial ] we gave a polynomial diagram   realising @xmath86 as a polynomial functor in @xmath2 .
let @xmath140 be a graded vector space and define @xmath139 via the same polynomial diagram in the category of graded vector spaces : @xmath388 equivalently @xmath389 is the vector space spanned by rooted trees with vertex set @xmath87}$ ] and edge labels in @xmath140 , subject to linearity in each edge label .
the set based description of the @xmath85 operad works on the level of polynomial functors and so suffices to show that @xmath139 is an operad .
however great care must be taken to keep track of the signs induced by the symmetry @xmath215 from the symmetric monoidal category @xmath390 of graded vector spaces . in order to do this
we must assign for each term @xmath391 in the sum   a reference ordering of the factors .
this requires assigning to each tree @xmath283 a total ordering on the set of edges @xmath33 .
let @xmath34 be such a tree and let @xmath100 be its root .
since each vertex has a unique incoming edge except for the root which has none , the set of edges @xmath33 is in bijection with the set of non - root vectices @xmath87}-i$ ] .
we take the ordering of @xmath33 from the natural ordering of @xmath87}-i$ ] .
so for instance the pair @xmath392\ar[ul ] & \\ & 4 \ar[u ] & } } } , x\otimes y\otimes z\right)}\quad\text{represents the $ y$-tree}\quad{\vcenter{\xymatrix@c=0.6pc@r=0.6pc{2 & & 3\\ & 1\ar[ur]_z\ar[ul]^y & \\ & 4 \ar[u]^x&}}}.\ ] ] the order of @xmath393 and @xmath394 in the tensor product is determined by the order of the edges .
the first step in giving the operad structure is to describe the action of the symmetric group @xmath89 on @xmath389 .
for instance applying the permutation @xmath395 to the @xmath2-tree considered in   we get @xmath396\ar[ul ] & \\ & 4 \ar[u ] & } } } , x\otimes y\otimes z\right ) } = \\=   { \left({\vcenter{\xymatrix@c=0.6pc@r=0.6pc{3 & & 4\\ & 1\ar[ur]\ar[ul ] & \\ & 2 \ar[u ] & } } } , ( 23)x\otimes y\otimes z\right ) }   = ( -1)^{|y||z|}{\vcenter{\xymatrix@c=0.6pc@r=0.6pc{3 & & 4\\ & 1\ar[ur]_y\ar[ul]^z & \\ & 2 \ar[u]^x&}}}.\end{gathered}\ ] ]    the signs involved in the composition @xmath397 for @xmath398 and @xmath399 are more easily accounted for .
this is because the edges within the righthand tree @xmath130 are not reordered within @xmath397 and so the sign depends on the total degree @xmath400 and not on the individual edges .
the edges of @xmath130 are ` moved past ' the edges @xmath401 for which @xmath402 .
hence if @xmath403 is the labelling of @xmath309 the sign change is given by @xmath404    the homology operad @xmath405 with coefficients in the base field @xmath6 is isomorphic to the linear operad @xmath406 .    with field coefficients
the homology functor @xmath407 from topological spaces to graded vector spaces respects products and coproducts and so is compatible with polynomial functors .
the explicit expression of this is @xmath408      let @xmath1 be an augmented cocommutative coalgebra and write its splitting as @xmath409 .
the operad @xmath387 will be a quotient of the operad @xmath410 , this is a parallel of the set - based versions .
let @xmath411 be a @xmath1-labelled rooted tree and suppose that it has an edge @xmath37 with the label @xmath412 and suppose further that @xmath100 is not the root of @xmath34 , as before we will call the edge @xmath37 reducible .
let @xmath6 be the unique vertex such that @xmath157 is an edge and let @xmath413 be the label of @xmath157 .
we define @xmath130 to be the unlabelled rooted tree created by removing the edge @xmath37 and replacing it by @xmath160 and denote by @xmath414 the edge labelled rooted tree based on @xmath130 where the edge labels are inherited from those of @xmath34 except for @xmath157 which is labelled by @xmath153 and @xmath160 which is labelled by @xmath152 .
finally we define @xmath159 to be the sum @xmath415 where @xmath274 is the sum of degrees @xmath416 and @xmath417 is the label of the edge @xmath418 .
the sign is given by the moving of the label @xmath419 from being adjacent to @xmath420 as in  @xmath51 to being in the relevant position to label the edge @xmath160 .
as before @xmath159 is called the reduction of @xmath34 at the reducible edge @xmath37 and just as before each @xmath1-tree reduces to a unique irreducible @xmath1-tree .    the graded vector space of linear based @xmath1-cacti , @xmath387 is defined by factoring out from @xmath410 the relations @xmath421 for trees @xmath34 with an edge @xmath37 labelled by @xmath412 where @xmath100 is not the root .    the graded vector space of irreducible @xmath1-trees and hence @xmath387 is given by @xmath422 where @xmath423 is the root of @xmath34 .
using the splitting @xmath56 we may rewrite this as a polynomial expression in @xmath424 .
there is a convenient way of indexing this polynomial ; rather than using irreducible @xmath1-trees , where an outgoing edge @xmath425 from the root @xmath230 could be labelled by @xmath412 , we cut the edges @xmath425 labelled by @xmath412 to leave a labelled forest , each component tree has a root , the corresponding @xmath125 and there is a chosen component tree , the tree containing @xmath230 .
let @xmath426 be the set of planted forests with a chosen tree .
then we may rewrite   as @xmath427    although this is a polynomial functor in @xmath424 with a similar diagram to  , the operad maps are not maps of polynomials , indeed the diagonal map of @xmath1 is used .
a similar polynomial description of @xmath190 holds when @xmath2 is a set , however this involves ` splitting ' the chosen point of @xmath2 and so this only works for a pointed topological space when the point is disconnected .
[ prop : cacti - distr ] the linear subspace of @xmath410 generated by relations of the form @xmath428 is an operadic ideal and so @xmath387 is an operad as a quotient of @xmath410 .

the homology functor respects products and coproducts and hence polynomial functors , this is how we see that @xmath432 .
however the cactus operad @xmath190 is not given by a polynomial functor . in the proof of  proposition  [ prop : bcygroupoid ]
we showed that @xmath186 was the colimit of a diagram containing a single copy of @xmath248 and a copy of @xmath244 for each pair @xmath247 where @xmath283 and @xmath433 where @xmath100 is not the root .
for each copy of @xmath244 there were two maps , one corresponding to @xmath34 and one to its reduction @xmath159 .
the act of taking the colimit makes identifications @xmath162 .
precisely the same discussion applies to the linear operad @xmath434 ; realising it as the colimit of the same diagram but with @xmath435 replacing @xmath244 and @xmath436 replacing @xmath248 .
unfortunately the homology functor @xmath407 preserves coproducts and products , but not general colimits .
therefore we can not just apply the homology functor to the colimit diagram for @xmath186 .
the chain functor @xmath437 which takes values in the symmetric monoidal category of differentially graded vector spaces does however preserve colimits
. therefore @xmath438 is the colimit of the diagram consisting of @xmath439 and copies of @xmath440 .
however @xmath437 does not preserve products which is inconvenient because @xmath441 can not be assumed to be a coalgebra , although we still have the diagonal maps @xmath442 which allow reductions to be made .
since @xmath2 is pointed there is a natural splitting @xmath443 and furthermore the inclusions @xmath444 induce splittings @xmath445 .
the most general splitting is given by taking the kernel of the map @xmath446 where the @xmath100th map forgets the @xmath100th coordinate , call this kernel @xmath447 .
then @xmath448 undergoes the splitting : @xmath449 } } \overline{c_\ast(y^{|a|})}.\ ] ] this splitting allows one to compute the colimit of the diagram computing the space  @xmath438 in the same manner as the computation of @xmath434 in  , using reductions @xmath162 as before .
therefore @xmath450 the homology functor does not necessarily preserve colimits but it does preserve products and hence @xmath451 therefore @xmath452 which is isomorphic to @xmath453 . that this is an isomorphism of operads is immediate because both cacti operads are defined as quotients of nap operads .    since when @xmath454 , the operad @xmath387 is the homology operad of a topological operad , it should not be surprising at all that for every coalgebra  @xmath1 the operad @xmath387 is a hopf operad  @xcite , which essentially means that algebras over it form a tensor category .
its diagonal map coincides with the diagonal of the coalgebra  @xmath1 on the space of generators : @xmath455_c}}})=\sum { \vcenter{\xymatrix@c=0.6pc@r=0.6pc{2\\1\ar[u]_{c_{(1)}}}}}\otimes { \vcenter{\xymatrix@c=0.6pc@r=0.6pc{2\\1\ar[u]_{c_{(2)}}}}}.\ ] ]    let us conclude this section with an example of a `` smallest nontrivial algebra '' over a linear operad of based cacti .
[ ex : perm - nap ] let @xmath2 be the ( pointed ) two - element set  @xmath456 , so that @xmath454 is the split two - dimensional coalgebra @xmath457 , the product @xmath458 defines a @xmath22-algebra , and the product @xmath459 defines an @xmath73-algebra . in every one - dimensional @xmath387-algebra ,
the @xmath22-product is commutative , and the @xmath73-product is associative , so they are very degenerate , and the first nontrivial example should be at least two - dimensional .
one can easily check that a two - dimensional _ noncommutative _ @xmath22-algebra is necessarily isomorphic to the algebra @xmath460 with multiplication table @xmath461 furthermore , to define a @xmath387-algebra structure on  @xmath143 , one should choose a @xmath462-matrix @xmath463 with @xmath464 , and put @xmath465 one particular example will be obtained if we put @xmath466 , so that the @xmath73-product in this algebra is given by @xmath467 this product is `` nontrivial '' enough : it has a noncommutative @xmath22-product , a nonassociative @xmath73-product , and moreover it does not fit into the series of algebras defined in example  [ ex : nap - from - perm ] ( since we have @xmath468 but @xmath469 ) .
assume that @xmath470 and @xmath471 are two quadratic operads . for two subspaces @xmath472 and
@xmath473 of the same operad @xmath64 , let us denote by @xmath474 the subspace of @xmath64 spanned by all elements @xmath475 with @xmath476 , @xmath477 . for two @xmath20-module mappings @xmath478 and @xmath479
one can define a quadratic operad @xmath480 with generators @xmath481 and relations @xmath482 , where @xmath483    informally , we join generators of @xmath484 and @xmath485 together , keep the relations of  @xmath485 , deform relations of @xmath484 , adding to them `` lower terms '' of degree at most @xmath43 in generators of @xmath484 , and impose a rewriting rule transforming @xmath486 into a combination of terms from @xmath487 and `` lower terms '' of degree  @xmath40 in generators of @xmath484 .
note that using the rewriting rule  @xmath488 , one can replace  @xmath346 by @xmath489 and from now on we shall denote by  @xmath346 that modified mapping .
assume that the natural projection of @xmath20-modules @xmath490 splits ( for example , it is always true in characteristic zero , or in arbitrary characteristic whenever the relations of @xmath484 remain undeformed , including the case of usual distributive laws ) .
then the composite of natural mappings @xmath491 gives rise to a surjection of @xmath20-modules @xmath492    [ def : filtered - distrib ] we say that the mappings @xmath346 and @xmath493 above define a filtered distributive law between the operads @xmath484 and @xmath485 if @xmath490 splits , and the restriction of @xmath494 to weight  @xmath209 elements @xmath495 is an isomorphism .
the following result ( generalising the distributive law criterion for operads that was first stated in  @xcite ) was proved in  @xcite using the set operad filtration method of  @xcite and in @xcite using a filtration on the koszul complex ; however , both proofs rely on the knneth formula for symmetric collections and thus are not available in positive characteristic because in that case the group algebras @xmath496 are not semisimple .
[ thm : filtered - distrib ] assume that the operads @xmath484 and  @xmath485 are koszul , and that the mappings @xmath346 and @xmath493 define a filtered distributive law between them .
then the operad @xmath480 is koszul , and the @xmath20-modules @xmath497 and @xmath480 are isomorphic .
let us first note that either of the characteristic zero proofs mentioned above ( set operad filtration ; filtration on the koszul complex ) works in the category of shuffle operads for arbitrary characteristic , since knneth formula over a field is always available . also , a symmetric operad @xmath64 is koszul if and only if it is koszul as a shuffle operad , which proves the first statement of the theorem . to prove the second statement
, we observe that in the category of nonsymmetric collections we have an isomorphism @xmath498 , and in the symmetric category we have a surjection @xmath499 .
since the forgetful functor from the category of symmetric collections to the category of nonsymmetric collections is one - to - one on objects , that surjection has to be an isomorphism .
the following filtered distributive law was discussed by the first author in @xcite as related to gelfand 
varchenko algebras of locally constant functions on the complement to a hyperplane arrangement ; unlike all other results of this paper , it is only available in characteristic zero .
it is well known ( and was probably first observed by livernet and loday ) that the associative operad admits an alternative description as an operad generated by a symmetric binary operation @xmath500 and a skew - symmetric binary operation @xmath501 $ ] that satisfy the relations @xmath502+[b,[c , a]]+[c,[a , b]]=0,\\ [ a\star b , c]=a\star[b , c]+[a , c]\star b,\\ ( a\star b)\star c - a\star(b\star c)=[b,[a , c ] ] . \end{gathered}\ ] ] if we put @xmath503 , @xmath504)$ ] , and consider the operads @xmath505 and @xmath506 , @xmath507,\\   d([a\star b , c])=a\star[b , c]+[a , c]\star b\end{gathered}\ ] ] then there are no additional relations in weight  @xmath209 , and in characteristic zero the projection @xmath508 splits , therefore the associative operad is built from @xmath68 and @xmath69 via a filtered distributive law .
thus we obtain a yet another proof of the koszulness of the associative operad , and also recover that as an @xmath20-module it is isomorphic to @xmath509 .
an easy linear algebra exercise shows that if @xmath480 is obtained from @xmath484 and @xmath485 via the mappings @xmath346 and @xmath493 as above , then the koszul dual operad  @xmath510 is similarly obtained from @xmath511 and  @xmath512 .
the following result shows that the notion of a filtered distributive law agrees very well with the koszul duality theory for operads ( which our previous example  being koszul self - dual  did not quite manifest ) .
[ thm : koszul - dual ] assume that the operad @xmath480 is obtained from the binary quadratic operads @xmath484 and @xmath485 via a filtered distributive law
. then its koszul dual  @xmath510 is obtained from @xmath511 and @xmath512 by a filtered distributive law as well whenever the projection @xmath513 splits .
if both operads  @xmath484 and  @xmath485 are koszul , then @xmath480 is koszul , and this gives us enough information to complete the proof , see  @xcite for details .
let us give a proof in the case of arbitrary  @xmath484 and  @xmath485 to show a yet another application of methods developed in  @xcite .
let us define an ordering on tree monomials in the free shuffle operad generated by  @xmath514 in the following way . for two tree monomials , we first compute the number of generators from @xmath515 used in each of them ;
if for one of them that number is greater than for the other , we say that monomial is greater than the other . otherwise , we compare tree monomials using the lexicographic ordering on paths  @xcite .
this way we can be sure that the leading monomials of  @xmath516 , tree monomials spanning @xmath517 , and the leading monomials of  @xmath518 are the leading monomials of the defining relations of  @xmath480 .
since the @xmath20-module @xmath480 is a quotient of @xmath497 , so the distributive law condition ensures that the set of weight  @xmath209 leading monomials of the reduced grbner basis of  @xmath519 is the union of the set of weight  @xmath209 leading monomials of the reduced grbner basis of  @xmath520 and the set of weight  @xmath209 leading monomials of the reduced grbner basis of  @xmath521 : the presence of `` mixed '' leading monomials would make @xmath522 smaller than its natural upper bound @xmath523 . in other words , all s - polynomials @xcite of weight  @xmath209 of @xmath519
are either s - polynomials of  @xmath520 or s - polynomials of  @xmath521 .
the above description of leading monomials of the reduced grbner basis means that we have the full information on the part of the free resolution of  @xmath519 consisting of elements of weight at most  @xmath209 , and a simple description of the homology classes of the bar complex of  @xmath519 up to weight  @xmath209 . from @xcite , we know that generators of a free resolution of  @xmath519 can be constructed in terms of `` overlaps '' of leading monomials of the reduced grbner basis of  @xmath519
. such generators of weight  @xmath4 are precisely the leading monomials of the defining relations , whereas the generators of weight  @xmath209 are either overlaps of pairs of leading monomials of defining relations or leading monomials of weight  @xmath209 elements of the reduced grbner basis .
the differential induced on the space of the generators of that free resolution can be computed as follows . if an overlap of two leading monomials of defining relations produces , according to buchberger s
algorithm  @xcite , a nontrivial s - polynomial , the differential maps the generator corresponding to that overlap to the generator corresponding to the leading term of the respective s - polynomial .
otherwise , the differential maps the corresponding generator to zero . together with the information on s - polynomials of  @xmath519 that we have ,
this means that up to weight  @xmath209 the homology of the bar complex of  @xmath519 is isomorphic to the shuffle composition of the corresponding homology for @xmath521 and @xmath520 . since the koszul dual operads are dual to the diagonal parts of the bar homology , our statement follows in the shuffle category . in the symmetric category ,
we observe that because of the splitting of @xmath513 , there is a surjection @xmath524 , and its bijectivity in weight  @xmath209 in the shuffle category implies bijectivity in the symmetric category as well .
we conclude this section with a general observation which appears to be useful for transferring statements of the characteristic zero operad theory in positive characteristic .
if one examines the proof of theorem  [ thm : filtered - distrib ] carefully , it becomes obvious that it works because of the following statement , a particular case of the operadic knneth formula  @xcite , which is valid over any ground field  @xmath26 .
let @xmath525 and @xmath526 be two reduced differential graded @xmath20-modules .
then @xmath527    let us note that there is a natural map @xmath528 our strategy is to apply the forgetful functor , and prove that @xmath529 is an isomorphism in the shuffle category .
since the forgetful functor is one - to - one on objects , this would mean that @xmath530 is an isomorphism . in the shuffle category , since the forgetful functor is monoidal ( that is the only part of the proof where it is crucial that our collections are reduced ) , we have @xmath531 and @xmath532 finally , since the shuffle composition is polynomial in the components of @xmath533 and @xmath534 , we have @xmath535 and the theorem follows .
in this section , we prove that the operads @xmath139 and @xmath387 are koszul , and also show how one can use filtered distributive laws to recover known results , and obtain new results on the structure of various known operads .      the operad @xmath536 was defined and studied in @xcite , and recently appeared in various contexts , see @xcite .
it is generated by a skew - symmetric operation @xmath501 $ ] and an operation @xmath537 without any symmetries that satisfy the relations @xmath502+[b,[c , a]]+[c,[a , b]]=0,\\ ( a\circ b)\circ c - a\circ(b\circ c)-(a\circ c)\circ b+a\circ(c\circ b)=a\circ[b , c],\\ [ a , b]\circ c=[a\circ c , b]+[a , b\circ c ] . \end{gathered}\ ] ]        by an immediate computation , we see that the operad @xmath536 is built from the operads @xmath542 and @xmath543 via a filtered distributive law . indeed , we may put @xmath544)$ ] , @xmath545 , and @xmath546+[b,[c , a]]+[c,[a , b]])=0,\\ d([a , b]\circ c)=[a\circ c , b]+[a , b\circ c],\\ d(a\circ[b , c])=(a\circ b)\circ c - a\circ(b\circ c)-(a\circ c)\circ b+a\circ(c\circ b)\end{gathered}\ ] ] ( the weight  @xmath209 condition can be easily checked by hand , and since @xmath547 , the projection is split automatically ) .
this proves both statements of our theorem .
the koszulness of @xmath536 and @xmath538 was established in @xcite using partition posets .
note that our approach applies to @xmath548 as well , since the splitting of the projection @xmath549 only requires the splitting on the level of generators , which we already have .
the @xmath20-module isomorphism @xmath550 was first observed in @xcite to the free algebra @xmath551 is consistent with the jacobi identity ) . ] .
this isomorphism , together with the following corollary , allows to complete the postlie algebras description in  @xcite .
note that the dual version of this corollary is not true : even though on the level of @xmath20-modules we have @xmath553 , it is easy to check the suboperad of the operad @xmath548 generated by the operation @xmath500 is isomorphic to @xmath22 .
the operad of commutative tridendriform algebras was studied by loday @xcite .
let us write down the relations of this operad , and of its koszul dual .
the operad @xmath554 is generated by a symmetric operation @xmath500 and an operation @xmath555 without any symmetries that satisfy the relations @xmath556 the operad @xmath557 is generated by a skew - symmetric operation @xmath501 $ ] and an operation @xmath539 without any symmetries that satisfy the relations @xmath502+[b,[c , a]]+[c,[a , b]]=0,\\ a\bullet[b , c]=a\bullet(b\bullet c),\\ [ a , b]\bullet c=[a\bullet c , b]+[a , b\bullet c],\\ ( a\bullet b)\bullet c = a\bullet(b\bullet c)+(a\bullet c)\bullet b.\end{gathered}\ ] ]      by an immediate computation , we notice that the operad @xmath554 is built from the operad @xmath72 and @xmath68 via a filtered distributive law .
indeed , we may put @xmath560 , @xmath561 , and @xmath562 ( the weight  @xmath209 condition can be easily checked by hand ; the projection @xmath563 splits because @xmath564 is a free @xmath565-module ) .
therefore theorems [ thm : filtered - distrib ] and  [ thm : koszul - dual ] prove all the statements of our theorem ( for the latter , we observe that the projection @xmath566 splits because for @xmath557 we have @xmath547 ) .    the @xmath20-module isomorphism in the first part was proved in  @xcite as a consequence of the existence of a good triple of operads @xmath567 and the isomorphism of @xmath20-modules @xmath568 .
our results recover that isomorphism , prove a similar isomorphism for @xmath557 , and also describe the sub - operads of @xmath554 and @xmath557 generated by either one of the operations .
this provides the following bits of information that have been missing in  @xcite .
note that though the underlying @xmath20-module of the operad @xmath570 is used in the definition of the operad  @xmath554 , the dual statement to the second part of this proposition is not true : in the operad @xmath554 , the suboperad generated by @xmath555 is not isomorphic to  @xmath72 because of the `` lower term '' @xmath571 added to the zinbiel relation .
the `` geometric '' version of this proposition is proved as part of proposition  [ prop : napoperad ] . that the linear version is generated by binary operations may be proved by precisely the same method . as before the relations just express the symmetric group action on trees : @xmath574^{d ' } \ar[ur]_{d '' } & } } } = ( -1)^{|d'||d''|}{\vcenter{\xymatrix@c=0.6pc@r=0.6pc{2 & & 3 \\ & 1\ar[ul]^{d ' } \ar[ur]_{d '' } & } } } .\ ] ]      note that according to proposition  [ prop : relations - nap ] , the operad  @xmath139 is a quotient of the operad @xmath575 generated by binary operations @xmath572 subject only to relations .
let us show that the operad  @xmath575 is koszul , and is isomorphic to  @xmath139 .
first of all , one can easily check that the koszul dual @xmath576 of the operad  @xmath575 has generators @xmath577 subject to relations @xmath578 this immediately implies that if we choose a basis @xmath579 of @xmath580 , then for a basis of @xmath581 we can take the set of all `` left combs '' @xmath582 because our relations mean that the tree monomials can only `` grow '' to the left , and that we can reorder all elements except for the leftmost one arbitrarily .
there are @xmath583 such monomials . at the same time , if we explicitly write the relations of @xmath575 as a shuffle operad , we see that its relations are @xmath584 here we use the notation @xmath585 to abbreviate the `` opposite operation '' @xmath586 .
let us pick a basis @xmath587 of  @xmath140 , and define an ordering of tree monomials in the free shuffle operad with binary generators @xmath572 which is very similar to the path - lexicographic ordering  @xcite . for two tree monomials ,
we first compare lexicographically their sequences of leaves , read left - to - right , and then compare the path sequences of those monomials , assuming @xmath588    the leading monomials of the relations of @xmath575 are , respectively , @xmath589 , @xmath590 , and @xmath591 .
the trees built from these monomials as building blocks give an upper bound on the dimensions of components of the koszul dual operad which is sharp precisely when our operads have quadratic grbner bases @xcite .
it is easy to see that there are exactly @xmath583 tree monomials built from these , so both the operads  @xmath575 and @xmath576 are koszul .
power series inversion equation for koszul operads
@xcite implies that @xmath592 since it is clear that @xmath593 after denoting @xmath594 , we see that @xmath595 is the inverse of @xmath596 under composition , and hence @xmath597 is the generating function enumerating rooted trees .
recalling that @xmath139 as an  @xmath20-module is described as @xmath140-decorated rooted trees , we conclude that components of @xmath575 and @xmath139 have same dimensions , and therefore these operads are isomorphic , the former being a quotient of the latter .
this proof concluded by showing that @xmath139 is presented by quadratic relations . by considering the linearization of the operad @xmath598 when @xmath599 is a finite set we see that @xmath598 is also presented by quadratic relations .
now suppose that @xmath2 is infinite .
any finite set of @xmath2-trees involves a finite number of labels @xmath599 and hence any relation in @xmath134 is contained within @xmath598 which is in turn presented by quadratic relations .
therefore we have the following .
the proof of theorem  [ thm : nap - koszul ] used arguments involving the koszul dual and its hilbert series to show that the quadratic relations suffices to present @xmath134 . a more direct proof is possible using a certain `` geometric '' map from @xmath600 to @xmath134 .
we will denote elements of @xmath601 by @xmath602{generator1 } } } \quad\text { and } \quad \vcenter{\hbox{\includegraphics[height=12mm]{generator2}}}\ ] ] for @xmath603 . in each generator
there is a thin line labelled with an element of @xmath2 , a thick line running from root to the end of a leaf and a small portion of thick line at the end of the other leaf
. then the @xmath134-relation   states that @xmath604{naprel1 } } } \quad = \quad \vcenter{\hbox{\includegraphics[height=20mm]{naprel2 } } } \quad = \quad d\circ_1 d ' .
( 23).\ ] ] the thin lines may be seen to `` move freely '' along the thick lines .
a couple of facts are apparent about any arity @xmath9 tree monomial in these generators :    1 .
the thick lines never branch and each thick line can be followed up the tree to a unique leaf , in this way the thick lines are in bijection with the leaves .
2 .   every thin line joins two thick lines and is labelled by an element of @xmath2 .
so by contracting each thick line to a point and using these as vertices we are left with a tree with vertex set @xmath87}$ ] .
the thin lines become the edges and are already labelled by elements of @xmath2 .
this tree is rooted by following the thick line starting at the bottom of the tree monomial to its leaf .
hence we have an explicit map from @xmath600 to @xmath134 .
an example : @xmath605{treemonomial } } }   \quad \mapsto \qquad   \vcenter { \xymatrix{&&4\\ 1 & 2 & 5 \ar[u]_c
\\   & 3 \ar[ul]^a \ar[u]_d \ar[ur]_b & } } \ ] ] the fact that the quadratic presentation forms a grbner basis means that the operad it presents may be described by certain admissible tree monomials . by comparing this basis with the @xmath2-trees via
the map just described we may see that @xmath134 is presented by the quadratic basis .
a reader interested in combinatorics should compare our construction with one of the well known `` catalan bijections '' which takes a planar rooted binary tree with @xmath9 leaves and contracts all left - going edges , thus obtaining a planar rooted tree with @xmath9 vertices .
let @xmath606 be a graded augmented cocommutative coalgebra .
the operad @xmath387 is generated by binary operations @xmath607 ; these operations satisfy the relations @xmath608 which suffice to present the operad .    according to proposition  [ prop : cacti - distr ] ,
the operad @xmath387 is isomorphic to the quotient of @xmath410 by the operadic ideal generated by relations  . also , from the proof of theorem  [ thm : nap - koszul ] , we know that the relations   are the defining relations of  @xmath410 , which completes the proof .    for the sake of completeness ,
let us describe the relations of the koszul dual operad  @xmath609 .
its space of generators is @xmath610 ; note that @xmath611 is a graded commutative algebra which splits as @xmath612 .
the relations are @xmath613 @xmath614 note that for @xmath615 the relation   is precisely the pre - lie relation .
this is not at all surprising , since by combining theorem  [ thm : koszul - dual ] with theorem  [ thm : cacti - koszul ] below we expect that the @xmath20-modules @xmath616 are isomorphic , and that @xmath617 is a suboperad of  @xmath609 .        using the splitting of  @xmath1 along the augmentation
, we can refine the formulae   and   as follows : @xmath620 the formulae  , , and   represent the formula   after splitting , and the formulae   and   represent the formula   after splitting .
it is clear that the formulae   and   describe the operad  @xmath22 , while the formula   describes precisely the operad  @xmath619 .
it remains to show that the formulae   and   define a filtered distributive law between these two operads . to be precise , we first need to check that the formula   stands a chance of defining a distributive law , since _ a priori _ its right hand side is a mixture of all possible tree monomials .
however , we first note that the compatibility of the counit with the coproduct ensures that if @xmath621 then @xmath622 so the tree monomial @xmath623 is missing on the right hand side of  .
also , the tree monomials of the form @xmath624 ( with @xmath625 ) appearing on the right hand side should be rewritten using the formula  , but this minor detail will not affect any of our computations .    to check that the formulae   and define a filtered distributive law between @xmath22 and  @xmath619 , one need to perform carefully all ambiguous rewritings bringing the generator  @xmath412 towards the root of a tree monomial , checking that they do not give additional new relations .
we shall omit the details , indicating briefly that the rewriting of @xmath626 does not result in a new relation because the coproduct of  @xmath1 is cocommutative , while the rewriting of @xmath627 does not result in a new relation because the coproduct of  @xmath1 is coassociative , and finally the rewriting of @xmath628 as well as @xmath629 does not result in new relations because of the nap - type relations .
this , together with the observation that the projection @xmath630 always splits because the relations of @xmath22 remain undeformed ( @xmath547 ) , completes the proof of our theorem .
let @xmath2 be the ( pointed ) two - element set  @xmath456 , so that @xmath454 is the split two - dimensional coalgebra @xmath457 , as in the example  [ ex : perm - nap ] below .
theorem  [ thm : cacti - koszul ] shows that we have an @xmath20-module isomorphism @xmath631 but the operads @xmath387 and  @xmath609 are substantially different .
of course , there is also a trivial operad structure on the @xmath20-module @xmath632 for which the insertion of any @xmath22-operation into any @xmath617-operation is equal to zero ; this operad is koszul and self - dual .
it is an open question whether there exist nontrivial self - dual koszul operad structures on @xmath632 via a distributive law or a filtered distributive law between @xmath22 and @xmath617 ; such operads would be natural candidates to encode `` pre - poisson algebras '' ( much different from the ones in  @xcite ) and `` pre - associative algebras '' .

guillaume william zinbiel , _ encyclopedia of types of algebras 2010 _ , preprint ` arxiv:1101.0267 ` ." ," motivated by the second author s construction of a classifying space for the group of pure symmetric automorphisms of a free product , we introduce and study a family of topological operads , the operads of based cacti , defined for every pointed topological space  @xmath0 . 
 these operads also admit linear versions , which are defined for every augmented graded cocommutative coalgebra  @xmath1 . 
 we show that the homology of the topological operad of based @xmath2-cacti is the linear operad of based @xmath3-cacti . 
 in addition , we show that for every coalgebra @xmath1 the operad of based @xmath1-cacti is koszul . to prove the latter result 
 , we use the criterion of koszulness for operads due to the first author , utilising the notion of a filtered distributive law between two quadratic operads . 
 we also present a new proof of that criterion which works over a ground field of arbitrary characteristic . "
"self - propelled particles ( spps ) are attracting more and more interest as a representative example of out - of - equilibrium systems@xcite .
examples of spps range from the microscopic scale , with algae and bacteria , to the macroscopic scale , which includes all animals , and recently , even artificial spps have been constructed , such as active janus particles@xcite . among them , microswimmers are of particular interest , since they are suited to well - controlled lab experiments@xcite , and have many potential applications , for example , as targeted drug delivery systems .
it is known that nontrivial motion , like the collective alignment of the swimming direction or the dynamic clustering can be observed , even for systems where particles interact with each other only through hydrodynamic interactions and excluded volume effects@xcite .
such collective motion is mainly due to the complicated hydrodynamic interactions , and can not be predicted only from knowledge of the single particle dynamics . that these hydrodynamic interactions are strongly affected by the presence of confining walls is well known .
experimentally , das _
_ reported that when a single janus particle swims in the vicinity of a wall , it tends to swim along the wall@xcite .
_ investigated the collective dynamics of a bacterial dispersion inside a circular confinement , and reported that the system spontaneously shows an anomalous double - vortex motion , the outermost agents swimming along the wall@xcite .
while most numerical studies have focused on the dynamics in bulk , several works have reported on the dynamics of microswimmers near walls or under confinement@xcite . in the case of single - particle dynamics under confinement ,
most works consider flat parallel walls or cylindrical pipes@xcite . as to the dynamics of many particle systems , they are usually studied under confinement of flat parallel walls . in particular , li and ardekani
have investigated the static structure and shown evidence for the accumulation of particles near the wall@xcite .
zttl and stark have studied a similar system@xcite , but under extreme confinement , and observed a dense - dilute phase separation , which is not seen in bulk .
our previous work@xcite has focused on the dynamic properties of a microswimmer dispersion confined between flat parallel walls with relatively large separations ( compared to the size of the particles ) . in ref .
@xcite , we observed a traveling wave - like collective motion for a specific range of swimming parameters and densities .
though such a motion would seem to be a consequence of confinement , we clarified that it can be understood as the manifestation of the pseudo - acoustic properties of the system , which is already observed in bulk .
as shown here , even for the same confinement geometry , the dynamic behavior can be considerably different depending on the strength of the confinement ( i.e. , the wall separation ) .
therefore , how the dynamics changes under confinement is a very difficult question to answer .
although we can find several works on the collective dynamics in bulk or between flat parallel walls , the many particle dynamics of swimmers in pipes has not been extensively studied so far .
this is the focus of the present work .
intuitively , we can expect that for big enough pipes , the dynamics will be the same as for bulk systems .
therefore , we focus on the dynamics in pipes with diameters comparable to that of the particle , where we can expect nontrivial behaviors .
in fact , in the work by zhu _
_ , which deals with the single particle dynamics in a pipe with diameter three times the particle diameter , it is reported that different dynamical modes can be observed depending on the swimming type and strength@xcite .
taking into account the possibility that the size and the shape of the pipe affect the dynamic properties , in this work , we investigated the collective alignment effects , known as the polar order formation , varying the four main parameters , namely , the pipe size , the pipe shape , the volume fraction and the type of the swimmers . regarding the polar order formation in many particle systems ,
the behavior in pipes is mostly the same as in bulk .
however , for a specified region of the parameter space , we observed clear wall effects , which we investigated by measuring the structural information of the dispersion .
in addition , we observed the pipe size dependent order / disorder phase transition only for the parameters at which clustering behaviors have been reported in bulk and between flat walls@xcite . in this work
, we also measured the bulk structural information and obtained indirect evidences which states that the clustering is important for the collective alignment for a specific range of parameters .
as the numerical model for microswimmers , we employed the squirmer model@xcite . in this model ,
the microswimmers are expressed by rigid particles with a prescribed flow field on their surface .
the general squirmer model is expressed in the form of an infinite expansion , with components in the tangential , radial , and azimuthal directions . however , utilizing only the first two modes of the tangential field , following eq .
( [ eq : sq_2 ] ) , already enables us to model different types of swimmers , namely pushers , pullers and the neutral swimmers .
@xmath0 where , @xmath1 denotes the surface flow field , @xmath2 is a unit vector directed from the center of the particle to a point on its surface , @xmath3 the polar angle between @xmath2 and the swimming direction @xmath4 , and @xmath5 is the tangential unit vector at @xmath2 .
this simplified squirmer model has been widely used and is known to lead to a wide variety of nontrivial phenomena@xcite .
the coefficient of the first mode , @xmath6 , determines the swimming velocity of an isolated squirmer ( @xmath7 ) , and that of the second mode , @xmath8 , determines the stresslet@xcite .
the ratio between the coefficients of the two modes , @xmath9 in eq .
( [ eq : sq_2 ] ) , determines the swimming type and strength .
negative values of @xmath10 represents pusher - type swimmers , which swim with an extensile flow field in the swimming direction , and positive values describe puller - type swimmers , which swim with a contractile flow . a value of @xmath11 stands for a neutral swimmer , which generates a potential flow field .
in this model , the prescribed flow field is assumed to be an axisymmetric pure tangential one and the particle is rigid and spherical .
these are the only assumptions employed to derive the model .
therefore , it is thought that this model can capture the features of the artificial microswimmers like janus particles even though it was originally intended to describe ciliary propulsion of micro - organisms .      in this work
, we investigate the dynamics of particles swimming in a viscous fluid . for this
, we must solve the combined fluid - solid problem . in order to do this efficiently , we employed the smoothed profile method ( spm ) . in the spm
, we do nt treat the sharp boundary between the solid and fluid phases explicitly . instead
, a diffuse interface with thickness of @xmath12 is introduced , and the phase boundaries are expressed by using a continuous order parameter @xmath13 , which takes the value of one in the solid domain , zero in the fluid domain , and intermediate values within the diffuse interface region . employing this methods , all the physical quantities can be expressed in terms of continuous fields defined over the whole computational domain .
thus , the calculation cost can be reduced by orders of magnitude .
see refs.@xcite for more detailed information about this method .    in this work , the dynamics of swimmers in pipes are considered . for this
, we have to model solid walls numerically . within the spm scheme
, the walls can be expressed by assemblies of particles which are pinned and not allowed to translate or rotate . by this
, the stick boundary at the wall surface is guaranteed .
the wall particles are placed uniformly and have the same diameter as the swimmer particles . because we consider various shapes and sizes of pipes , the number of particles composing the walls varies depending on the pipe .
we note that the surface of the confinement has a non - zero roughness because the walls are represented by a collection of discrete particles .      using the calculation method presented above
, we conducted three dimensional direct numerical simulations ( dns ) of microswimmer dispersions confined in pipes .
the diameter @xmath14 and interface thickness @xmath12 of particles are set to be @xmath15 and @xmath16 respectively , where @xmath17 stands for the grid spacing . the excluded volume effect between particles ( both wall - particle and particle - particle )
is implemented by a truncated lenard - jones type @xmath18 potential ( @xmath19 ) . regarding the parameters in eq .
( [ eq : sq_2 ] ) , we set @xmath20 for all the calculations and varied @xmath10 to study the @xmath10 dependency of the dynamics .
this value of @xmath6 gives a particle reynolds number of one for an isolated swimmer .
the symmetry axis of the pipe is defined to be parallel to the @xmath21 axis . in what follows
, we refer to the confinement with a circular cross section as a pipe , and the one with a rectangular cross section as a duct .
regardless of the size or shape of confinement , the length of the pipe @xmath22 is set to be @xmath23 and the periodic boundary condition is set in this direction ( in other directions , the system is enclosed by the confinement , and the system size in those directions depends on the confinements ) . unless stated otherwise ,
thermal fluctuations are ignored throughout this paper .
we will consider the pipe with diameter @xmath24 to be our reference confinement system .
the diameter @xmath25 is measured with respect to the center of the particles composing the walls .
for the definition of the particle volume fraction we used : @xmath26 where @xmath27 the volume of one particle and @xmath28 the volume in which particle centers can move freely . in our systems , @xmath28 for a pipe is calculated following eq .
( [ eq : vm ] ) because of the excluded volume effect between swimmers and wall composing particles , @xmath29 where , @xmath30 . for ducts ,
a similar correction is employed .

( a ) pusher s rotational orbit ( @xmath31 ; represented by blue ) ( b ) neutral swimmer s spiral trajectory ( @xmath11 ; represented by gray ) ( c ) puller s rectilinear path ( @xmath32 ; represented by red ) .
note that these three trajectories are obtained using the same initial position and orientation .
only the trajectories in steady states are shown .
white particles represent the particles composing the pipe . to facilitate the visualization , only half of the pipe - particles are drawn . ]
the single - particle dynamics in a pipe has been studied by zhu _
et al . _ , who reported that distinct dynamical modes are observed depending on the swimming parameter @xmath10@xcite . in order to confirm the qualitative agreement within our calculation scheme , we performed calculations with one particle for various values of @xmath10 . here
, we consider only a pipe with diameter @xmath24 . after a sufficiently long time , all the cases achieve steady states .
typical trajectories of the steady states are shown in fig .
( [ fig : trajectories ] ) . here , the result of the cases with @xmath33 are shown .
the dynamical mode at the steady state depends only on the sign of @xmath10 and is independent of the absolute value : a pusher gets trapped in an orbit and shows constant rotation at a fixed @xmath21 position , while a puller shows rectilinear translation along the pipe axis at a constant distance from the wall .
a neutral swimmer achieves the combined dynamics of the two modes : spiral motion along the pipe axis ( rotation + translation ) .
these results are consistent with the results in ref.@xcite ; although the trajectories of the pushers are not analyzed in detail in this work .
as shown here , the single - particle dynamics are affected by the confinement .
the intriguing thing is that the dynamical mode is determined only by the sign of @xmath10 , independent of the absolute value .
regarding the bulk collective properties , it is known that such an absolute value dependence exists .
for example , the polar order @xmath34 ( eq .  ( [ eq : bulk_q ] ) ) , used to measure the collective alignment , strongly depends on the absolute value of @xmath10 .
@xmath35 where , @xmath36 stands for the number of particles in the system .
this quantitative measure of the degree of order , @xmath34 , takes a value of one when the system is completely aligned , and @xmath37 when the system is completely isotropic .
the value of @xmath34 decreases as the absolute value of @xmath10 increases@xcite .
we next performed calculations for many particle systems in a pipe of diameter @xmath24 .
it is already known that the polar order @xmath34 is a function of both the swimming parameter @xmath10 , and the volume fraction of the particles @xmath38 .
first of all , let us recapitulate the behaviors in bulk systems@xcite . if we measure the polar order as a function of @xmath10 at a certain value of the volume fraction , the value of @xmath34 decreases with the increase in the absolute value of @xmath10 , as stated above .
this tendency is asymmetry with respect to positive and negative @xmath10 values , with negative values ( pushers ) , showing a faster decay . if we regard @xmath34 as a function of @xmath38 for a certain value of @xmath10 , the behavior is most easily understood in terms of the deviations from the volume fraction dependence for neutral swimmers .
this reference system ( @xmath11 ) shows two regimes : for @xmath39 , the values are constant ; for @xmath40 there is an abrupt drop in the order parameter to @xmath41 . a similar behavior is observed for pushers ( negative values of @xmath10 ) . at small volume fractions , they show only a weak decrease with increasing volume fraction , and then exhibit an abrupt drop at a critical volume fraction @xmath42 .
pushers show a decrease both in the degree of ordering and the value of @xmath42 .
pullers , on the other hand , show a decrease only in the degree of ordering , and systems with @xmath43 even maintain the order at very high volume fractions , where all other systems show @xmath41 . specifically , we stress that in bulk , the system with @xmath32 shows a nonzero value of @xmath34 up to very high volume fractions
.    we conducted simulations over a wide range of combinations of @xmath10 and @xmath13 in the pipe . from the particle trajectories obtained from these simulations
, we then calculated the polar order parameter along the @xmath21 direction ( the direction of the pipe elongation ) , @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the @xmath21-component of the swimming direction @xmath4 of particle @xmath46 and the angular brackets denote a time average . in fig .
[ fig : bulk_pipe ] , the values of @xmath47 are shown as a function of @xmath10 . here , the values of @xmath34 in bulk are also shown .
the volume fraction is @xmath48 for all the cases ( @xmath49 in the pipe , @xmath50 in bulk ) . in fig .
[ fig : bulk_pipe ] , we see a good match between results in bulk and those in pipe over a wide range of @xmath10
. however , for @xmath51 , we see clear differences . in pipes , over this @xmath10 range , the values of @xmath34 are reduced compared to the bulk results , with the gap increasing with an increase in the absolute value of @xmath10 .
finally , at @xmath52 , the dynamics show a qualitatively different behavior : in the pipe , @xmath53 which means the order is completely lost .     the polar order parameter @xmath47 in a pipe with diameter @xmath54 as a function of the swimming parameter @xmath10 . the polar order @xmath34 in bulk systems is also shown as a light - colored line .
the volume fraction is @xmath55 in both cases .
the dashed line stands for the value of @xmath56 . ]     the polar order parameter @xmath57 in a pipe with diameter @xmath54 as a function of volume fraction and swimming parameter .
the polar order @xmath34 in bulk systems is also shown using dashed lines . ]        in fig .
[ fig : order_pipe_big ] , detailed results showing the volume fraction dependency are shown for four different values of @xmath10 , which exhibit qualitatively different behavior , @xmath58 . for the volume fraction ,
we consider six different values in the range of @xmath59 ( corresponding to @xmath60 ) .
as before , the bulk results are shown as dashed lines in fig .
[ fig : order_pipe_big ] .
although the results in the pipe are qualitatively the same as those in bulk for some of the cases , several differences can be perceived . in the case with @xmath11 , the value of @xmath34 at the smallest volume fraction , @xmath61 shows an obvious reduction in the pipe compared to the bulk . at other volume fractions ,
the values match reasonably well .
in the case of @xmath62 , we observe a similar reduction at the lowest volume fraction .
in addition , in this case , we observe a rise in @xmath57 at intermediate volume fraction ( @xmath63 ) .
finally , in the case with @xmath32 , we see no polar order ( @xmath64 ) at any of the volume fractions considered .    in order to understand these differences from the view point of the structures inside the pipe , we measured the following two functions , the local density @xmath65 and the local polar order along the @xmath21-axis @xmath66 .
these are defined as a function of the perpendicular distance @xmath67 from the symmetry axis of the pipe : @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the number of particles at a distance @xmath70 from the pipe axis , @xmath71 the average number density of the whole system , @xmath72 the width of the cylindrical bins , and the summation in eq .
( [ eq : qinpipe ] ) is taken over all the particles in a given bin .
the local density of the shell matches the overall average value when @xmath73 .
the results are shown in fig .
[ fig : dis_pipe ] for the same values of @xmath10 shown in fig .
[ fig : order_pipe_big ] . from this figure
, we can explain the differences seen in fig .
[ fig : order_pipe_big ] . in the case of @xmath74 and @xmath75 ,
when the volume fraction is small ( @xmath76 , ( a ) ) , particles show a strong tendency to accumulate in the vicinity of the wall and almost no particles are observed within the central region ( @xmath77 ) .
such a wall accumulation effect has been reported for active systems in general@xcite , and several works on squirmers have also shown this behavior@xcite . at the same time , we can see that the local polar order is reduced in the vicinity of the wall .
in other words , the pipe can be divided into two distinct regions from the view point of @xmath78 : an inner region where the local order has a value similar to that of the corresponding bulk dispersion , and an outer region ( near to the walls ) where the order is reduced . in the following ,
we specify the characteristic size of this outer region by @xmath79 , the distance from the wall to the point where the inner region starts .
because most particles accumulate in this outer region , where the order is reduced , the overall polar order is smaller than that in bulk .
then , as @xmath38 is increased , the particles will become more uniformly distributed , and @xmath80 is reduced . at the same time , due to the wall accumulation effect , the effective volume fraction in the center region is smaller than the global volume fraction . taking into account the fact that the polar order increases with decreasing volume fraction ,
this reduction in the volume fraction leads to a higher local polar order at the center , compared to the bulk value at the same global volume fraction .
as a result of these two effects , namely , the decrease in @xmath80 and the increase of the local order due to the diluteness at the center , at @xmath81 , the value of @xmath47 recovers the bulk result . in the case of @xmath62 , at @xmath82 , the value of @xmath47 is even larger than that in bulk . in the case of @xmath11 , such an overshoot
is not observed .
this is because for @xmath11 , the volume fraction dependency of
the polar order is so small that the order is determined only by the value of @xmath83 . for @xmath32 ,
the value of @xmath83 becomes very large and we do nt see any ordering throughout the pipe , although the system with @xmath32 does show a nonzero value for polar order parameter @xmath34 in bulk . in the limit when the diameter of the pipe goes to infinity , we expect the dynamics should converge to that observed in bulk
. therefore , we should see a qualitative transition at a critical diameter .
this will be investigated in more in detail in sec .
c .. we also note that the behavior of @xmath84 for @xmath32 is very similar to that of @xmath85 at all volume fractions , although the order formation tendencies are completely different . at the highest volume fraction @xmath86 , because of the screening of the hydrodynamic interactions , the excluded volume effects become dominant in determining the structure .
consequently , the structure is the same for all values of @xmath10 .
however , it is interesting to note that only in the case of @xmath85 , do we observe a nonzero value of @xmath47 .
we have clarified that in many particle systems , the wall effects can be characterized by the accumulation of particles over a distance of @xmath80 close to the walls .
these can lead to both enhancement and inhibition of the ordering , depending on the degree of accumulation and the size of @xmath80 .
while for some cases we do observe a rectification effect due to the existence of walls , the origin for such effects seems to have nothing to do with the causes responsible for the single particle trajectories presented above .      here , we show results for the pipe diameter dependence on the many - particle dynamics .
first , we present the results for the single - particle systems in a pipe with a `` small '' diameter . here , we use @xmath87 , which corresponds to the system in ref.@xcite . for these single - particle systems
, we have observed the same qualitative results as those for @xmath24 ( which we refer to as the `` big '' pipe ) , except for pushers .
first , let us recapitulate the single particle motion in the big pipe . in this case
, the three different swimmers ( puller , pusher and neutral swimmer ) show qualitatively different trajectories .
a puller swims parallel to the pipe axis , while a pusher is trapped in a closed orbit at a constant @xmath21-value .
finally , a neutral swimmer shows a behavior in between that of a pusher and a puller , namely a spiral motion . in the small pipe
, only a pusher shows a different dynamical mode from that observed in the big pipe . in the small pipe , a pusher follows a spiral trajectory , just like a neutral swimmer .
while a pusher in the big pipe also shows a spiral trajectory at the beginning of the simulations , the pitch will gradually become shorter , until the pusher becomes trapped in a closed orbit . in the small pipe
the pitch of the spiral is constant and does nt show this decay .
nevertheless , we still see a distinct difference between a pusher and a neutral swimmer , if we look at the projection onto the @xmath88-plane ( see fig .  [
fig : tra_pro ] ) .
the pusher s trajectory shows a perfect circular shape while the neutral swimmer shows a wave - like pattern .
the trajectory we have obtained for the neutral swimmer is neither regularly patterned nor closed , unlike the results report in ref@xcite .
we believe this discrepancy is due to the roughness of the wall surface .

the dark lines are for the pipe with @xmath91 , while the light lines are for @xmath24 .
the volume fraction is @xmath55 for both cases .
the shaded region represents the region where the anomalous behavior was reported in ref.@xcite . ]
next , we investigated the polar order of many particle systems in the small pipe .
we present the results for a pipe with @xmath91 , as a basic reference system , but we have confirmed that the same qualitative results are obtained for @xmath87 , for both the single- and many - particle dynamics . in the small pipe , over a specific range of parameters ,
the value of the polar order does nt show a stable nonzero value . in fig .
[ fig : t_e ] , the time evolution of the temporal order @xmath96 , defined in eq .
( [ eq : ave_e ] ) , is given for two cases to illustrate both the steady and unsteady behaviors .
@xmath97 both results are for a system with @xmath91 and @xmath98 , and the steady results are for @xmath99 ( the weak pullers ) , the unsteady one for @xmath85 ( intermediate pullers ) .
as seen here , in the unsteady system , even the sign of @xmath96 , which represents the direction of motion , changes in time ; while in the systems with stable order , such change is never observed .
this change of direction shows the absence of any long - time persistent order in the pipe . in order to evaluate such direction - flipping behavior , we define an alternative in - pipe polar order parameter that can also indicate the persistence of the motion : @xmath100 only the order of taking the average and the absolute value
is changed with respect to the standard definition of the polar order @xmath47 , eq .
( [ eq : pipe_q ] ) . for the cases
in which the direction does nt change , the values @xmath47 and @xmath95 are essentially the same .
we measured @xmath95 in the small pipe for various values of @xmath10 and compared the results with those obtained for the big pipe .
the results are shown in fig .
[ fig : order_pipe_small ] at a volume fraction of @xmath63 .
we observe a remarkable differences over the range @xmath101 . in the small pipe
, @xmath96 has no steady state value and changes directions , as described above .
actually , for such systems , the values of @xmath95 are around @xmath102 , which means that the system has no order .
we consider this collapse of the order as an order / disorder phase transition .
the gray - shaded region in fig .
[ fig : order_pipe_small ] indicates the range of @xmath10 at which anomalous behaviors were reported in preceding studies@xcite . in ref.@xcite , over this range of @xmath10 , particles form big cluster which exhibit traveling wave - like motion , bouncing back and forth between walls .
interestingly , the shaded area corresponds very well to the region over which we observe the pipe - size dependent order / disorder transition in the present work .
we refer to pullers in these regions as `` intermediate '' pullers . for @xmath10 values other than those of intermediate pullers ,
the results are roughly the same between @xmath24 and @xmath91 .
we note that we have confirmed that the same qualitative results are obtained for different values of @xmath38 , at least over the range we have considered  ( @xmath103 ) .
we would also like to stress that in bulk , we have observed a similar order / disorder phase transition when we change the volume fraction@xcite : when the volume fraction becomes very high , none of the swimmers except intermediate pullers are able to maintain the polar order . in contrast , in pipes , only intermediate pullers lose their polar ordering when the size of the pipe becomes small .     the pipe diameter dependency of the in - pipe polar order @xmath95 .
the horizontal axis represents the pipe diameter @xmath104 normalized by the particle diameter .
the volume fraction is @xmath55 for all cases . ]
we have also investigated the detailed size dependency of the polar order for intermediate pullers . in fig .
[ fig : size_d_05 ] , the values of the polar order @xmath105 are shown as a function of the pipe diameter . here , the results are shown not only for intermediate pullers @xmath85 , but also for weak pullers @xmath99 , which do nt show the phase transition .
the volume fraction is @xmath55 for all cases ( @xmath106 , depending on the size of the pipe ) .
we see an abrupt drop of @xmath95 at the critical diameter @xmath107 , though at higher @xmath108 , the values are constant . in systems with @xmath109 , the value of @xmath95 does not achieve the steady state , similar to the situations seen in fig .  [
fig : order_pipe_small ] .
in other words , in such small pipes , intermediate pullers can not maintain the polar order anymore , though temporally they can exhibit order .
we believe this sensitivity to the size suggests that intermediate pullers need clusters bigger than a characteristic size @xmath110 to stabilize the polar order .    in order to specify the size of the cluster in bulk , we performed bulk simulations and measured the generalized radial distribution functions @xmath111@xcite , @xmath112 where @xmath113 represents the distance from a reference particle @xmath46 to a second particle @xmath114 , @xmath115 the relative angle between the swimming directions of both particles , and @xmath116 is the @xmath117-th degree legendre polynomial .
the zero - order function @xmath118 is the standard radial distribution function , and the first - order function @xmath119 represents the local degree of order . in the limit when @xmath120 , we expect @xmath121 and @xmath122 .
therefore , we can define the excess local polar order @xmath123 , in such a way that it will converge to zero in the limit of @xmath120 .
the bulk system considered here has a cubic domain with a linear dimension of @xmath124 .
periodic boundary conditions are used in all directions , and the particles have the same diameter and interface thickness as in the simulations discussed above .
the volume fraction is tuned by changing the number of particles , @xmath125 .
the calculated results for @xmath118 , @xmath119 and @xmath126 are shown in fig .
[ fig : gen_dis ] , for @xmath127 and @xmath58 , corresponding to the confined systems in fig .
[ fig : dis_pipe ] .
in addition , results for @xmath118 for passive colloidal systems are shown to aid in comparison .
for these passive systems , the temperature is set so that @xmath128 , where @xmath129 is the energy unit in our system , @xmath130 the fluid mass density and @xmath131 the viscosity .
the exact value of the temperature does not affect the radial distribution function , provided that it is small enough .        to begin the analysis of the structure , we discuss the behavior of @xmath132 for the reference system of passive colloids . at the smallest volume fraction  ( @xmath76 )
, it shows only a small first peak around @xmath133 , and quickly decays , converging to one around @xmath134 .
the intensity of this first peak becomes larger as the volume fraction increases . at a volume fraction of @xmath135
, we observe a shallow undershoot after the first peak .
the correlation length becomes longer and the value converges to one at around @xmath136 . at @xmath82 ,
it starts to show a second peak at a position @xmath137 , though the intensity is very small .
finally , at @xmath86 , the system is in a mixed state of ordered and disordered phases@xcite , and shows four clearly distinguishable peaks .
now , we would like to present the results for the active systems . in the case of @xmath11 , for all the volume fractions but the highest one ,
the first peak is smaller or shifted to larger distances compared to the passive system .
in addition , the first peak does nt even appear at the lowest volume fraction , @xmath76 .
these behaviors may indicates that there is an effective repulsive interaction between particles caused by the flow field . due to this repelling flow field ,
neutral swimmers tend to get distributed uniformly .
similar effects can be seen in the pipe , as shown in fig .
[ fig : dis_pipe ] where neutrals swimmers show a much more uniform distribution compared to the pushers .
the correlations beyond the first peak follow closely those of the passive system , while other swimmers show longer ranged correlations .
this tendency may reflect the fact that the flow field around a neutral swimmer ( decaying as @xmath138 ) is more localized , because of the lack of the force dipole term ( decaying as @xmath139 ) .
regarding @xmath140 , the qualitative behavior follows that of @xmath132 .
we note that the neutral swimmers exhibit a unique behavior around @xmath136 , where @xmath141 shows negative values for intermediate values of @xmath142 .    in the case of @xmath62 and @xmath143 ,
the results are quite similar for all the volume fractions , although the peak heights show slight differences . in these cases ,
the particles seem to show attractive tendencies due to the flow field , resulting in higher peaks for @xmath118 . as before
, @xmath140 follows the qualitative behavior seen in @xmath118 . besides the higher peaks ,
the correlation length is longer than that seen for neutral swimmers .
however , the bulk values are reached by @xmath144 in all cases .    in the case with @xmath85 , or intermediate pullers , many unique behaviors can be observed .
first of all , for intermediate pullers @xmath132 shows much more outstanding peaks than in any of the other cases . at @xmath135 ,
only intermediate pullers show a definite second peak , and at @xmath82 , the second peak is much higher than in the other systems , and a third peak even appears .
a similar peak behavior can be observed also in the plot of @xmath145 .
in addition , we see a very long tail , which is not seen in the other cases .
all these unique behaviors for intermediate pullers can be understood as indirect evidence for their already known dynamic clustering tendency@xcite .
the high peaks reflect the clustering behavior , and the long tail in @xmath119 shows the strongly localized ordering .
the nonzero order at high volume fractions helps explain how intermediate pullers can swim collectively , even under such extreme conditions .
we note that the critical diameter of the pipe @xmath110 is bigger than any of the peaks detected here .    at the highest volume fraction , @xmath86 , the shapes of @xmath118 are the same for all @xmath10 , while only the passive system shows a different shape .
regarding the neutral swimmer systems , @xmath11 , this is surprising because this system shows quite similar shapes at all the other volume fractions .
the shape difference of @xmath132 between the passive and active systems at @xmath86 may be due to the phase transition of the passive system .
for passive hard - spheres , the volume fraction in the range @xmath146 is known as the transient state of the ordered state and the disordered state@xcite . in the passive system at @xmath86 , shown in fig .
[ fig : gen_dis ] , such an ordered state seems to appear , while the active systems are still completely in the fluid phase . at this volume fraction , because the excluded volume effect is the dominant factor to determine the structure , rather than the flow field , all the active systems show the same shape for @xmath147 . in summary , although we could not obtain a direct connection between the bulk structural information and the in - pipe order / disorder phase transition , we believe our results for the structure present indirect evidence for the importance of the dynamic clustering on the stabilization of the polar order for intermediate pullers systems . in order to verify the exact connection between these two quantities
, we have to conduct a more detailed analysis on the dynamic clustering in bulk .
our previous results @xcite support this view on the importance of dynamic clustering . in this work , we investigated whether or not the polar order seen in bulk can be explained only by the repetition of binary collisions .
we found that this is the case , except for systems of intermediate pullers , which means that many particle interactions might be important in this case .    finally , we have also considered pipes with diameters larger than @xmath54 . as the pipe size increases
, we can expect that the dynamics approaches that of seen in bulk systems .
indeed , for systems with @xmath148 , we see in fig .  [ fig : order_pipe_big ] that the order parameters in confinement agree very well with the bulk values .
thus , for these values of @xmath10 , @xmath24 seem to be big enough . therefore , we have only considered larger diameters for @xmath32 , to investigate whether a finite value of @xmath34 is recovered for a large enough pipe diameter .
we considered diameters up to @xmath149 but were not able to recover the bulk values in this case .
thus , the hypothesis stated in section iii .
b. is still not solved within the range of parameters considered in the present study .
although it is possible that the dynamics can change for even larger diameters , we will not discuss this problem any more , as it lies outside the scope of the present work .
the dynamics of fluids in pipes is known to depend on the shape of the cross section .
therefore , we have also investigated the effect of the shape dependency on the dynamics of the swimmers .
so far , most previous investigations have concerned dynamics in cylindrical pipes , with circular cross sections . here , we consider pipes with a rectangular cross section .
we refer to such confinement geometries as `` ducts '' .
we considered two sizes of ducts , specified by a lateral size of @xmath150 and @xmath54 , respectively . regarding the single - particle dynamics , the trajectories are qualitatively different from those in pipes for the case of pushers and neutral swimmers .
pullers will swim parallel to the duct axis , as they do in pipes . in ducts ,
regardless of the size , the trajectories of the pushers are spiral .
of course , reflecting the duct shape , the projections onto the @xmath88-plane are no longer circular ( fig .
[ fig : pro_tra_duct ] ) .
the neutral swimmer shows a similar spiral trajectory , but it has a strong dependency on the initial state and sometimes the trajectories can become more complicated ( fig .
[ fig : pro_tra_duct ] ) . considering all the results for the single - particle system of pushers
, we can conclude that the emergence of the circular closed orbits depends strongly on the curvature of the confining walls .
therefore , if we increase the diameter of the pipe continuously from @xmath54 , at some point we will find a critical value for pushers to lose their orbit - type characteristics .
such a detailed study is beyond our scope .

the lines represent the projections of the trajectories , with color intensity used to represent the time . ]    with regards to the many particle dynamics , we do nt see any big differences from those in pipes .
namely , the results are almost the same as those in bulk when the duct size is big enough , and the ordering seen for intermediate pullers collapses when the size is decreased . as a result , intriguingly , from the view point of the polar order of the many particle dispersion , the results are qualitatively the same between pipes and ducts
. however , it is possible that we one can observe unique dynamics in a skewed confinement .
we investigated the polar order formation in pipes , conducting three - dimensional direct numerical simulation with fully resolved hydrodynamics . as a result of the investigation over a broad range of parameters
, we confirmed that in most cases the dynamics of many particle systems in pipes match very well those in bulk .
we have only observed considerable differences over a small range of parameters .
we have presented an explanation for the emergence of wall effects by measuring the structural information .
they are mostly due to the wall accumulating effects and the reduction in the degree of order in the vicinity of the walls .
also , we have studied the effects of the change in pipe size .
we have clarified that for a specific range of the swimming parameter , the system undergoes an order / disorder phase transition when the size of the pipe shrinks .
considering the results of the structural analysis both in pipes and in bulk , we believe that this is due to the intrinsic clustering tendency of the swimmers .
there seems to exist a minimum cluster size which is necessary to maintain the polar order of intermediate pullers .
if we change the shape of the confinement , we found no qualitatively differences , from the view point of the polar order .
these results can be utilized to address the transport problem of microswimmers , however , further studies , like in winding pipes or in pipes with abrupt expansion / contraction are desired for realistic applications .

 such swimmers are known to show collective alignment in bulk , and we confirmed that similar alignment can be observed even in pipes , although the volume fraction dependency shows qualitative differences . by comparing the structural information , we investigated the cause of such differences . 
 we found an order / disorder phase transition for a specific type of swimmers , as the size of the pipe becomes comparable to the size of the swimmers . 
 such dynamics are found not to depend on the geometry of confinement . "
"an atom s core level binding energies depend on its chemical species .
this fact has been exploited for decades in order to determine the proportion of different species within a given sample via core level spectroscopy - which provides the distribution of core electron binding energies within a sample .
an atom s binding energies also depend on its environment , i.e. , the species of its surrounding atoms .
for instance , in a cu metal all atoms have the same environment , and hence the binding energies for a given cu core level type , e.g. 2p@xmath0 , will be the same for all atoms .
by contrast , in a cupd alloy exhibiting substitutional disorder the cu atoms exhibit a variety of environments , and hence also a variety of 2p@xmath0 binding energies .
such a dispersion in the binding energies has been observed in many alloy systems @xcite , and in theory can be used to deduce information about specific environments within a sample , including the concentration profile on the atomic scale .
the viability of achieving this via high kinetic energy photoelectron spectroscopy ( hike ) has recently been demonstrated @xcite .
this is promising because hike , unlike other widely - used techniques , is both bulk - sensitive and non - destructive .
such environment - resolved spectroscopy would prove useful to the many research areas involving alloys in which segregation plays a crucial role , e.g. metal embrittlement @xcite , and nanocatalyst design @xcite .
however , success in this endeavor hinges upon a solid understanding of the relationship between an atom s environment , its electronic structure , and its core level binding energies in alloys .
the central quantity with regards to environment - resolved spectroscopy in alloys is the ( alloy - metal ) core level shift ( cls ) , which for a core level bound to an @xmath1 site @xmath2 is defined as @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the binding energy of the core level , and @xmath5 is the binding energy of the core level belonging to the type under consideration in a pure @xmath1 metal .
note that this is a site - dependent quantity ; one must determine @xmath6 for all @xmath1 sites in the system under consideration in order to determine the @xmath1 cls distribution .
this is problematic for systems exhibiting substitutional disorder on account of their lack of periodicity - which is a prerequisite for treatment within the conventional theoretical framework exploited by most _
ab initio _ methods .
one way around this problem is to approximate the system under consideration as periodic , but with a large unit cell , i.e. , a supercell . in this _ supercell approximation _
one determines @xmath6 for all @xmath1 sites , and hopes that the range of environments exhibited by these sites is representative of the ` true ' ( non - periodic ) system , and hence will result in an accurate representation of the true @xmath1 cls distribution .
random alloys - the archetype of disordered alloys in which there are no correlations between the species of sites - are the most tractable system exhibiting substitutional disorder to treat theoretically , and have been the focus of both experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite attempts to understand the distribution of clss in alloys . in this context the dispersion of @xmath1 clss is known as ` disorder broadening ' on account of the increased width of , for example , the cu cls distribution for a cupd random alloy relative to that for a cu metal .
sophisticated _ ab initio _ models utilizing the supercell approximation have provided insight into disorder broadening in these systems @xcite .
however , most systems of practical interest can not be idealized as random alloys , and unfortunately the complexity of these systems is such that a description of their disorder broadenings using _ ab initio _ models is intractable within the supercell approximation .
accurate methods do exist which do not resort to the supercell approximation .
_ ab initio _ methods rooted in the coherent potential approximation ( cpa)@xcite have been shown to provide excellent agreement with experiment @xcite .
furthermore , they can treat complex systems @xcite .
however , cpa - based approaches can not provide detailed information regarding the disorder broadening in complex systems - nor even random alloys . while phenomenological models have been developed which can provide such information @xcite ,
their accuracy has been questioned @xcite .
one criticism is that these models do not take into account ` final state effects ' associated with changes in the valence electron density after photoemission .
it has even been claimed that the complexity of the relationship between clss and environment in alloys precludes an accurate alternative to _ ab initio _
methods @xcite .    here
we present an accurate phenomenological model for clss in alloys which relates @xmath6 - including the final state contribution - to the environment of site @xmath2 .
the model , like previous approaches , is charge - transfer based , and provides a simple framework for rationalizing the disorder broadening phenomenon .
the layout of this work is as follows . in sec .
[ sec : model ] we review the theory which underpins the model , and derive expressions for clss which apply to a wide range of alloy systems .
we then apply the model to the problem of characterizing the interface quality of metallic multilayers .
this problem has received significant attention on account of its importance to nanotechnology @xcite , and can be restated as follows : what is the degree of ` interface roughening ' @xmath7 in a given sample ?

our model is based upon the charge - excess functional model @xcite within the non - random approximation @xcite ( nra - cefm ) .
after briefly reviewing the nra - cefm in sec .
[ sec : nracefm_review ] , in sec .
[ sec : nracefm_deltaebi ] we use it to derive a relation between @xmath6 and the environment of site @xmath2 . in the subsequent subsections this relation is itself used to derive expressions for the mean and full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of various cls distributions . while our expression for @xmath6 presented in sec .
[ sec : nracefm_deltaebi ] is valid for _ any _ alloy - subject to the assumptions which underpin the nra - cefm - our expressions for means and fwhms apply only to the class of alloys which can be described as having a concentration profile which varies along one direction from monolayer to monolayer . to elaborate , for an alloy belonging to this class , the quantities @xmath13 for all @xmath1 and @xmath14 describe the concentration profile , where @xmath13 denotes the concentration of @xmath1 sites within monolayer @xmath14 , and we are assuming that the species of sites belonging to a given monolayer @xmath14 are assigned randomly in the appropriate concentrations . note that this class includes random alloys , for which @xmath15 for all @xmath14 , where @xmath16 denotes the global concentration of species @xmath1 . furthermore , note that we use the following convention for labeling the monolayers : monolayer @xmath14 is the @xmath14th monolayer in the direction in which the concentrations of each species are varying .      the charge - excess functional model ( cefm ) @xcite has been shown to provide an accurate description of the charge distribution in disordered alloys @xcite .
it has also been shown to provide an accurate description of energy differences between alloy configurations with the same _ composition _ @xcite - where by composition we mean a specification of the underlying lattice and the quantities @xmath16 for all @xmath1 . in the cefm
the alloy energy is postulated to take the form @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the madelung energy , @xmath19 is the madelung potential of site @xmath2 , @xmath20 is the net charge on site @xmath2 , @xmath21 is the strength of the ` local interactions ' within site @xmath2 which act to keep the charge of site @xmath2 at its ` bare ' value @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is a constant .
for all @xmath1 sites , @xmath21 and @xmath22 take the same values @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively .
minimizing @xmath26 subject to the constraint of charge neutrality leads to the following expression @xcite : @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 is a lagrange multiplier added to enforce charge neutrality .
eqn . describes the _ q - v _ relations , which are borne out in _ ab initio _ calculations to a high degree of accuracy @xcite .
this partly explains the success of the cefm .
eqn . can be derived within the class of generalized coherent potential approximations ( gcpas ) described by bruno _
@xcite , with the additional - essentially exact @xcite - assumption that charge transfer due to madelung interactions is small .
here we consider the cefm within this framework , in which case @xmath25 is equivalent to the charge of an @xmath1 site embedded in the gcpa effective medium for the system under consideration , given the constraint that the site s madelung potential is 0 .
in other words , @xmath25 is the charge of an @xmath1 site embedded in the effective medium if the madelung interactions are ` switched off ' .
furthermore , @xmath24 is the linear response coefficient relating the madelung potential of the @xmath1 site to its perturbation from @xmath25 , and @xmath23 is the energy of the alloy if the madelung interactions between sites are switched off - which can be expressed as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the energy of an @xmath1 site embedded in the effective medium if madelung interactions are switched off , and @xmath32 is the total number of sites in the system .
conventional cpa calculations do not take into account madelung interactions , and hence for gcpa theories based upon cpa effective media @xmath25 is simply the charge of an @xmath1 site obtained from a conventional cpa calculation , and @xmath31 is the corresponding @xmath1 energy .
calculations reveal that gcpa effective media are numerically indistinguishable @xcite for all alloys with the same composition .
hence the same applies for the quantities @xmath25 , @xmath24 and @xmath23 : these quantities are transferable between such systems .
the complexity of the cefm is significantly reduced if one makes the assumption that @xmath24 takes the same value @xmath33 for all species @xcite .
this assumption is known as the non - random approximation ( nra ) , and we use it throughout this work .
the non - random approximation is borne out calculations utilizing the single - site locally self - consistent green s function method @xcite - a gcpa method . in the nra - cefm @xmath20 for an @xmath1 site
obeys @xcite @xmath34 where : @xmath35 is the number of @xmath36 sites in the @xmath37th nearest neighbor shell of site @xmath2 ; @xmath38 and the quantities @xmath39 and @xmath40 for all @xmath37 depend only on @xmath41 and the underlying lattice _ _ type__. ] - where @xmath42 is the wigner - seitz radius for the system under consideration - and are tabulated in ref . for the fcc , bcc and sc lattices .
note that the free parameters @xmath33 and @xmath43 ( for all @xmath44 ) can be obtained from _ ab initio _ calculations or by other means @xcite .
furthermore , the values of @xmath35 for all @xmath37 and @xmath36 characterize the environment of @xmath2 . therefore eqn . explicitly relates @xmath20 to the environment of site @xmath2 .
eqn . also allows us to interpret an alloy s charge distribution in terms of charge transfer between pairs of _ unlike _ sites as follows @xcite : an @xmath1 site gains a charge @xmath45 from each @xmath36 site in its @xmath37th nearest neighbor shell , with the @xmath36 site losing the opposite amount .
this picture allows us to attribute the following physical significance to the quantity @xmath46 : it is a measure of the _ electropositivity _ of species @xmath36 for the given composition .
we will now use the nra - cefm to derive an expression for the cls of site @xmath2 . to do this
, we first derive an expression for the total energy @xmath26 in terms of the bare charges @xmath22 of all sites .
eqn . can be rewritten more explicitly as @xmath47 for the nra - cefm , where we have used eqn . .
minimizing this with respect to the site charges , and subject to the constraint of global charge neutrality gives @xcite @xmath48 where @xmath49 denotes the mean value of @xmath22 over all @xmath2 . substituting the above into eqn . and simplifying gives @xmath50 where we have used the fact that @xmath51 now , the following expression holds for the charges at the minimum in @xmath26 @xcite : @xmath52 where @xmath53 @xmath54 denotes the madelung matrix , and @xmath55 denotes the identity matrix .
this becomes @xmath56 since @xcite @xmath57 substituting eqn . into eqn .
gives @xmath58 which becomes @xmath59 after separating out the terms containing @xmath60 and noting that @xmath61 is a symmetric matrix @xcite .
we will use the above equation in a moment .
the binding energy of a core level associated with site @xmath62 is @xmath63 where @xmath64 denotes the energy of the alloy s initial state - before photoemission from site @xmath62 , and @xmath65 denotes the energy of the alloy s final state - after photoemission from site @xmath62 . in the complete screening picture @xcite the valence electrons in the final state
are assumed to be fully relaxed so to reach their minimum energy configuration . with this in mind , the energy of the final state is simply the energy of the initial state , but with the atomic core within @xmath62 replaced by its photo - ionized analogue .
we choose site @xmath62 to belong to species @xmath1 , and denote the ` species ' corresponding to a photo - ionized @xmath1 site as @xmath66 .
hence @xmath67 is the energy change if site @xmath62 , originally belonging to species @xmath1 , is transformed into species @xmath66 .
eqn . allows us to evaluate the change in @xmath26 due to such a transformation . noting that the terms on the lower line of eqn .
are unaffected by the transformation ( since @xmath33 and @xmath25 for all @xmath1 are composition - dependent , and the composition - which we defined in terms of macroscopic quantities - is unaffected by the transformation ) , that the transformation is such that @xmath68 , and also that @xmath69 ( see eqn . ) , we obtain @xmath70 this can be rearranged to give @xmath71 which in turn becomes @xmath72 after using eqn . and noting that @xmath73 @xcite .
we emphasize that @xmath74 in the above equation refers to the charge of site @xmath62 _ before _ photoemission . finally , substituting the above equation into eqn . , and relabeling site @xmath62 as site @xmath2 , we obtain the following expression for the cls associated with site @xmath2 : @xmath75 where @xmath76 is composition - dependent .    eqn . describes a species- and composition - dependent linear mapping between @xmath20 and @xmath6 .
therefore changes in the @xmath1 cls distribution associated with configuration changes - such as an increase in the interface roughening @xmath7 in a multilayer system - directly reflect changes in the @xmath1 charge distribution .
furthermore the _ shape _ of the cls distribution is the same as that of the charge distribution on account of the linear nature of the mapping between @xmath20 and @xmath6 .
we will elaborate on these points later .
henceforth we consider the mean and fwhm of the cls distributions for various groups of @xmath1 sites .
note that the fwhm of any random variable @xmath77 is related to its variance by the equation @xmath78 we will use this fact several times below .
we will also use the fact that the mean and fwhm of @xmath6 for _ any group _ of @xmath1 sites @xmath79 within a given alloy , as follows from eqn . ,
are given by @xmath80 and @xmath81 respectively , where @xmath82 and @xmath83 denote the mean and variance of the charge distribution for @xmath79 .
consider the group of all sites within a random alloy .
for random alloys @xcite @xmath84 and @xmath85 where @xmath86 denotes the variance of @xmath22 over _ all sites in the system _ , and @xmath87 depends only on @xmath41 and the underlying lattice type , and is tabulated in ref .
for the fcc , bcc and sc lattices .
therefore for random alloys eqns . and yield @xmath88 and @xmath89 where we have defined @xmath90 and used the fact that @xcite @xmath91    for binary alloys consisting of species @xmath92 and @xmath93 the above equations simplify to @xmath94 and @xmath95 for @xmath96 .      henceforth we consider the class of systems described at the beginning of this section in which the species concentrations    can vary from monolayer to monolayer .
let @xmath79 be the set of @xmath1 sites within monolayer @xmath14 .
furthermore , let @xmath97 and @xmath98 denote the mean and fwhm respectively of the cls distribution for @xmath79 .
a similar notation will be used later for other quantities , e.g. @xmath99 and @xmath100 .
we will now derive an expression for @xmath97 .
consider a site @xmath2 within @xmath79 .
from eqn . , @xmath20 can be expressed as @xmath101 where @xmath102 denotes the number of @xmath36 sites in the @xmath37th nearest neighbor shell of @xmath2 which are in monolayer @xmath103 .
taking the mean over all @xmath104 gives @xmath105 now , @xmath102 over @xmath104 describes a random variable distributed according to the multinomial distribution .
specifically , @xmath102 is the number of times outcome @xmath36 occurs in @xmath106 trials , given the probability of outcome @xmath36 in a single trial is @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is the total number of sites in the @xmath37th nearest neighbor shell of any site @xmath109 which also belong to _ one _ monolayer which is ` @xmath110 monolayers away ' from @xmath109 - with @xmath111 referring to the monolayer which contains site @xmath109 itself .
the properties of the multinomial distribution are such that @xmath112 , and hence the above equation becomes @xmath113 this can be rewritten as @xmath114 where we have defined @xmath115 finally , substituting eqn . into eqn .
gives @xmath116    for species @xmath92 in a binary alloy
the above simplifies to @xmath117    the quantities @xmath118 depend on the lattice type , @xmath41 , and the set of lattice planes which constitute the monolayers .
they determine the coupling between monolayers with regards to @xmath99 and @xmath97 .
it can be shown that for the concentration profile @xmath15 for all @xmath14 , i.e. , a random alloy , the above equations become equivalent to those given earlier for random alloys .
this is the case since @xmath119 which can be shown by noting that @xmath120 and @xcite @xmath121      we will now derive an expression for @xmath98 . taking the variance of eqn . over @xmath104 gives @xmath122 after noting that the random variables @xmath123 and @xmath124 , defined by considering @xmath102 and @xmath125 for @xmath104 , are independent if @xmath126 or @xmath127 . expanding the variance on the right - hand side gives @xmath128 , \end{split}\ ] ] where @xmath129 denotes the covariance of random variables @xmath77 and @xmath130 . because @xmath102 over @xmath104 form a multinomial distribution , @xmath131 and @xmath132 substituting these equations into eqn .
gives @xmath133 , \end{split}\ ] ] where we have defined @xmath134 substituting eqn . into eqn .
gives    @xmath135}\ ] ]    for species @xmath92 in a binary alloy the above equation simplifies significantly : @xmath136    the quantities @xmath137 determine the coupling between monolayers with regards to @xmath138 and @xmath139 . as was the case for @xmath140 , if @xmath15 for all @xmath14 then the above equations become equivalent to those given earlier for random alloys .
this is the case since @xmath141 which can be shown by appealing to eqn . as well as the definition of @xmath87 :
@xmath142      from the quantities @xmath140 for all @xmath14 , the mean cls @xmath143 over _ all _ @xmath1 sites in the system under consideration can be determined by using the following expression : @xmath144 where @xmath145 is the _ weight _ to be given to monolayer @xmath14 .
for the ` true ' mean , @xmath145 is given by @xmath146 however , one is often interested in the mean of the cls distribution observed experimentally , which may differ from the ` true ' value on account of the fact that the probability @xmath147 of a photoelectron emitted from monolayer @xmath14 escaping the alloy is monolayer - dependent . in this case
@xmath145 is given by @xmath148    eqn .
follows trivially from the following theorem : if @xmath149 is a set of @xmath150 values whose mean is @xmath151 , then the mean of the superset @xmath152 formed by combining the sets @xmath149 for all @xmath2 is @xmath153 this result can be derived from the definitions of @xmath154 and @xmath151 : @xmath155      from the quantities @xmath143 , and @xmath140 and @xmath139 for all @xmath14 , the fwhm in the cls distribution over all @xmath1 sites @xmath156 can determined using the following expression :    @xmath157}.\ ] ]    eqn . can be derived by applying eqn . to the analogous equation to eqn . for the variance : @xmath158,\ ] ] where @xmath159 denotes the variance of @xmath149 , and @xmath160 denotes the variance of @xmath152 .
the above equation can itself be derived somewhat similarly to eqn .
: @xmath161 ^ 2 \\ = & \sum_i\frac{n_i}{n}\biggl[\frac{1}{n_i}\sum_{\varepsilon\in\sigma_i}(\varepsilon-\mu_i)^2+(\mu_i-\mu)^2 \\ & + 2\frac{1}{n_i}(\mu_i-\mu)\sum_{\varepsilon\in\sigma_i}(\varepsilon-\mu_i)\biggr ] , \end{split}\ ] ] which becomes eqn .
after noting that the final term in the last equality vanishes .
in the next section we apply the expressions of sec . [
sec : mean_fwhm ] to various multilayer systems .
all systems we consider have an fcc underlying lattice , and the monolayers are the 001 planes . however , to apply these expressions we first had to determine the monolayer coupling parameters @xmath118 and @xmath137 , which are defined in eqns . and . in ref .
, @xmath39 and @xmath40 are tabulated as a function of @xmath41 for the fcc , bcc and sc lattices . using this information , and
after determining the quantities @xmath108 - which depend on the underlying geometry - one can tabulate @xmath118 and @xmath137 as a function of @xmath41 for any fcc , bcc or sc system . for other lattice types ,
@xmath39 and @xmath40 must be determined as a function of @xmath41 beforehand .
a procedure to do this is described in ref . .
we determined @xmath118 and @xmath137 for the 001 planes of the fcc lattice at selected @xmath41 .
the results are shown in fig .
[ fig : structural_params ] .
we considered @xmath1621.4 , 1.6 , 2.0 , 2.6 and 3.0 , which reflects the range of @xmath41 found in the literature @xcite .
note that the coupling between monolayers rapidly tends to zero with @xmath110 .     and @xmath137 for the 001 planes in the fcc lattice for various values of @xmath41
. the top panel shows @xmath118 vs. @xmath110 ; while the bottom panel shows @xmath137 vs. @xmath110 .
the @xmath41 to which each curve corresponds can be deduced from the key in the top panel.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in addition to the aforementioned ` analytical ' results , we also performed supercell calculations for each of the systems we considered . in our supercells ,
each monolayer contained 200 sites , with the species of sites in each monolayer @xmath14 assigned randomly such that the desired species concentrations @xmath13 were obtained as closely as possible .
@xmath6 was determined for each site using eqns . and .
these @xmath6 where then used to determine @xmath163 , @xmath139 , @xmath143 and @xmath156 in the conventional manner , which allowed us to cross - check our analytical results . for all systems
the analytical and supercell results were in excellent agreement , though we choose not to present the supercell means and fwhms for the sake of brevity and clarity of presentation .
in addition to cross - checking , the supercell values of @xmath6 were used to simulate core level spectra for some systems . in this regard
we used the following equation : @xmath164 where @xmath165 denotes the intensity of the @xmath1 spectrum at cls @xmath166 , @xmath167 is a lorentzian function with fwhm @xmath168 , and @xmath169 is the lifetime broadening of the core levels under consideration . the above equation does not take into account many features which are present in ` real ' spectra such as surface core - level shifts , experimental broadening , doniac - sunjic asymmetry , and inelastic scattering . however , since our simulated spectra are primarily for illustrative purposes , ignoring these complications is justified .
our supercell calculations served one further purpose .
later we present histograms of , for binary systems , the frequency of @xmath92 sites exhibiting each possible number of @xmath93 nearest neighbors , and for ternary systems , the frequency of @xmath92 sites exhibiting each possible combination of @xmath93 and @xmath170 nearest neighbors .
we used our supercells to generate these histograms : for each supercell we counted the number of @xmath92 sites with each possible composition of nearest neighbor shell .
we first present results for systems consisting of a thin film of species @xmath92 and thickness @xmath172 monolayers embedded in a @xmath93 substrate , i.e. , @xmath171 .
we examined such systems with various @xmath172 and @xmath7 , where recall that @xmath7 denotes the degree of interface roughening . following refs .
, interface roughening was modeled by convoluting the ` unroughened ' concentration profile with a discrete gaussian function @xcite , where @xmath7 denotes the standard deviation of the function . to elaborate
, the concentration profile corresponding to @xmath7 was calculated using the following equation : @xmath173 for all @xmath1 , where @xmath174}{\displaystyle\sum_{d'=-\infty}^{\infty}\exp\big[-(d'/\sigma)^2/2\bigr]}\ ] ] is the discrete analogue of a gaussian function with standard deviation @xmath7 , and @xmath175 denotes the unroughened concentration profile .
the quantities @xmath176 , @xmath177 , @xmath178 and @xmath179 for various @xmath171 systems are presented in figs .
[ fig : mean_bab ] and [ fig : fwhm_bab ] . in calculating these values
, we used the set of @xmath41 described in the previous section .
furthermore , we set @xmath180 , @xmath181 , and @xmath182 . results ( in ev ) obtained using these parameters can be generalized to any choice of @xmath42 ( in bohrs ) , @xmath183 , @xmath184 ( both in units of @xmath185 ) and @xmath186 ( in ev ) at the corresponding value of @xmath41 by multiplying all means and fwhms by @xmath187 , and additionally adding @xmath186 to all mean clss .
we will use this fact in a moment .
some interesting results are immediately apparent from figs .
[ fig : mean_bab ] and [ fig : fwhm_bab ] .
firstly , as can be seen from both figures , the model results only depend weakly on @xmath41 .
this is convenient because the ` true ' value of @xmath41 for a given system is unclear ; values of @xmath41 are very sensitive to the _ ab initio _ method used to obtain them .
the same is true for the quantities @xmath43 , and presumably also for the quantities @xmath188 and @xmath189 .
this is illustrated in table [ table : ab_initio_compare ] , where the @xmath41 and @xmath190 for the bcc random alloy cu@xmath191zn@xmath191 obtained using different _ ab initio _ methods are compared . in calculating each @xmath41 in the table we took @xmath33 to be the mean of the _ ab initio _ _ q - v _ relation gradients @xmath192 and @xmath193 for cu and zn .
furthermore , we calculated @xmath190 from the _ q - v _ relation intercepts via @xmath194 ( see eqn . ) .    .@xmath41 and @xmath190 for cu@xmath191zn@xmath191 obtained using various _ ab initio _ calculations .
the abbreviation ` lsms ' refers to the locally self - consistent green s function method ; and ` lapw ' refers to the linearized augmented plane wave method . see refs . and references therein for details regarding these calculations . [ cols='^,^,^',options='header ' , ]     our second observation relates to fig .
[ fig : fwhm_bab ] .
one might expect that , at a given composition and parametrization of the model ( i.e. , choice of the quantities @xmath41 , @xmath183 , @xmath184 and @xmath186 ) , the @xmath92 fwhm would be maximized at the random alloy configuration .
this configuration corresponds to the largest configurational entropy , and therefore might be expected to exhibit the largest range of environments and hence also the largest fwhm .
moreover , since , as can be seen from eqn . , @xmath195 is maximized when @xmath196 , one might therefore also expect that the corresponding fwhm , which is an upper bound for the fwhm of a random alloy , is also an upper bound for _ all _ alloys .
however , our results reveal that this is _ not _ the case . in each panel of fig .
[ fig : fwhm_bab ] , the random alloy upper bound corresponding to the same model parametrization as we used for our @xmath171 systems is indicated by a dotted line .
note that for some systems @xmath179 is significantly larger than the random alloy upper bound .
it is even possible for the upper bound to be exceeded in ` unroughened ' ultra - thin films - as is evident from the left - most column in fig .
[ fig : fwhm_bab ] .
therefore inhomogeneous concentration profiles can yield larger disorder broadenings than is possible in random alloys - a fact which we provide an explanation for later .
a similar observation has been made in our earlier study@xcite using the linear charge model@xcite : surface segregation was shown to result in a significantly larger disorder broadening relative to the unsegregated random alloy . however in that study surface effects are implicit in the simulated spectra , and hence can not be discounted as a contributing factor to the very large broadening . by contrast here
we have shown that a very large broadening can occur in the absence of surface effects . in the aforementioned study we suggested that segregation could explain the anomalously large disorder broadening observed experimentally by medicherla _
_ et al.__@xcite .
our results here provide further evidence for this hypothesis .
in contrast to @xmath179 , the monolayer fwhms @xmath197 seem to be constrained to be below the random alloy upper bound .
this can be understood by noting that the @xmath92 sites in monolayer @xmath14 experience a local environment which closely resembles a random alloy , and hence @xmath197 ( to a good approximation ) can not exceed the upper bound .
considering only nearest neighbors , each @xmath92 site in monolayer @xmath14 has @xmath198 nearest neighbors in monolayer @xmath14 , @xmath199 in monolayer @xmath200 , and @xmath199 in monolayer @xmath201 . since _ within each monolayer
_ we have assigned sites species randomly in the required concentrations , it follows that the environment of an @xmath92 site in monolayer @xmath14 is approximately that of a random alloy with concentration @xmath202     systems calculated using the model .
each column pertains to a different value of @xmath7 , which is indicated above the column ; each row pertains to a different value of @xmath41 , which is indicated to the right of the row .
each circle represents @xmath176 for a particular monolayer @xmath14 ; the size of the symbol is proportional to @xmath203 . only results pertaining to monolayers with @xmath204 are shown .

the details of the figure are the same as in the caption to fig . , except that circles represent @xmath178 , and solid lines connect @xmath179 for each value of @xmath172 .
furthermore , the dotted line in each panel corresponds to the upper bound on the fwhm of a random alloy at the corresponding value of @xmath41.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]      the @xmath171 systems we considered were deliberately chosen to be identical to the fcc systems considered in ref .
, in which olovsson _
et al . _ calculated @xmath205 for ni / cu@xmath206/ni and co / cu@xmath206/co .
the @xmath205 and @xmath205 determined by olovsson _
are shown in fig .
[ fig : mean_olovsson_bab ] . comparing this figure with fig .
[ fig : mean_bab ] we see that the model is in excellent qualitative agreement with those of olovsson _ et al .
_ for the ni / cu@xmath206/ni systems .
the agreement is especially good at higher values of @xmath41 . for the co / cu@xmath206/co systems , the agreement is reasonable .
however , it should be borne in mind that the dispersion of clss in co / cu@xmath206/co is very small , and hence any uncertainties implicit in the _ ab initio _
method used by olovsson _
_ will be larger relative to the size of the dispersion : olovsson _ et al .
_ quote clss to a precision of 10mev , which is significant on the scale of the co / cu@xmath206/co dispersion , but not for the ni / cu@xmath206/ni dispersion .
the @xmath42 used by olovsson _
_ in their calculations was 2.6 bohrs for both ni / cu@xmath206/ni and co / cu@xmath206/co . with this in mind , and recalling the procedure described above for generalizing our model results to different free parameters
, we found that @xmath207 , @xmath208ev and @xmath209 gave excellent agreement with olovsson _
_ for ni / cu@xmath206/ni . for co / cu@xmath206/co we found acceptable agreement when @xmath207 , @xmath210 , and @xmath211ev .
these values are similar to analogous quantities obtained from _ ab initio _
calculations for other alloys @xcite . however , as mentioned earlier , the values of these quantities are sensitive to the _ ab initio _ method used to obtain them .
hence an interesting prospect is to use the model to determine their values experimentally .
olovsson _ et al .
_ used the @xmath205 from their calculations to simulate core level xps spectra .
however , since their calculations did not provide values for @xmath212 , it was necessary for olovsson
_ to make some assumptions regarding these quantities .
they assumed that @xmath212 was the same for all @xmath14 .
[ fig : fwhm_bab ] reveals that , in fact , the quantities @xmath212 vary widely within any one system .
hence the assumption made by olovsson _
is incorrect .
however , it is unclear whether the breakdown of this assumption is important from a practical point of view . while accurate knowledge of the quantities @xmath98 - as well as perhaps higher moments of the @xmath1 cls distribution for each monolayer - is necessary to reproduce the fine details of the total @xmath1 cls distribution for the system under consideration , in practice these fine details are ` smeared out ' in the experimental spectrum due to complications such as lifetime and experimental broadening . therefore getting some of the fine details wrong in the spectrum before accounting for the aforementioned complications may be inconsequential with regards to accurately reproducing experimental spectra .
/ni and co / cu@xmath206/co systems calculated by olovsson _
et al . _ ( ref . ) .
the significance of each column , and the symbols and lines , is the same as in fig .
[ fig : mean_bab ] .
the top row of graphs corresponds to ni / cu@xmath206/ni , while the bottom row corresponds to co / cu@xmath206/co.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    it should be noted that olovsson _
considered a further system in their study in addition to ni / cu@xmath206/ni and co / cu@xmath206/co : fe / cu@xmath206/fe .
we do not perform a thorough comparison between our model calculations and those of olovsson _ et al .
_ for fe / cu@xmath206/fe because the underlying lattice for fe / cu@xmath206/fe is bcc , while our model calculations are for an fcc underlying lattice . at @xmath213 and @xmath214 , the qualitative nature of the _ ab initio
fe / cu@xmath206/fe results is similar to that for ni / cu@xmath206/ni and co / cu@xmath206/co . in these cases
we therefore expect that the model will perform well for fe / cu@xmath206/fe .
however , as pointed out by olovsson _
, a well - known interface state exists in ordered , but not in disordered fe / cu@xmath206/fe systems , which causes ` anomalous ' results for @xmath10 .
it would be interesting to see whether model calculations utilizing a bcc lattice can reproduce this .      in the previous subsection we considered an isolated thin film embedded in an infinite substrate .
this was done primarily to allow comparison with analogous _ ab initio _ results .
however , experimental studies have focused on _ periodic _ multilayer systems .
we now consider such systems ; specifically , those comprised of ni and cu in which the repeating unit consists of @xmath172 monolayers of ni adjacent to @xmath216 monolayers of cu , i.e. , [ ni@xmath206/cu@xmath215 .
we considered various @xmath172 , @xmath216 and @xmath7 .
as above , we used eqn . to obtain the concentration profile for a given @xmath7 . with regards to the parametrization of the model
, we used the ` best - fit parametrization ' described above for the ni / cu@xmath206/ni systems , i.e. , @xmath217 , @xmath218ev , and @xmath219 .
the @xmath220 and @xmath221 for various [ ni@xmath206/cu@xmath215 systems as a function of @xmath7 are presented in fig .
[ fig : trajectories_cuni ] ; we show the ` trajectory ' of the pair @xmath222 as @xmath7 is varied from 0 to @xmath223 .
note that at @xmath224 intermixing between the ni and cu regions is absolute , and [ ni@xmath206/cu@xmath215 becomes a random alloy with @xmath225 . as is evident from fig .
[ fig : trajectories_cuni ] , as @xmath7 increases , @xmath220 becomes more negative , and @xmath221 increases initially , before decreasing and finally settling on the random alloy value .
the exception is [ ni@xmath226/cu@xmath8 ] , for which @xmath221 monotonically decreases with @xmath7 , i.e. , the system exhibits a ` disorder narrowing ' .
we will now explain these trends .    , determined using the model .
each color pertains to a different system ; each system is labeled .
symbols indicate the ( mean ,  fwhm ) evaluated at @xmath7 from 0 to @xmath223 at intervals of @xmath7 of 0.2 .
some of the symbols are annotated with their value of @xmath7 .
curves connect the symbols , and trace the ( mean ,  fwhm ) from @xmath10 to @xmath224 for each system.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]      a pleasing feature of the model is that it provides a simple means of rationalizing changes in cls spectra due to configurational changes .
consider eqn . .
an insightful approximation is to ignore the dependence of @xmath20 on the environment of site @xmath2 beyond its nearest neighbor shell , in which case for cu in nicu systems the number of ni nearest neighbors @xmath11 of site @xmath2 wholly determines @xmath20 . for @xmath227 , where recall that @xmath228 denotes the number of sites in any site s @xmath37th nearest neighbor shell , and @xmath229 denotes the global concentration of ni
this would lead to better agreement between the histograms and model spectra in fig .
[ fig : figure_cu5ni5])(b ) .
however , we do not do this here for the sake of simplicity . ] specifically , @xmath20 is linear in @xmath11 : @xmath230 the same then applies to @xmath6 ( from eqn .
): @xmath231 using the above expression the cu spectrum can be decomposed into , or constructed from , components associated with cu atoms with each value of @xmath11 , which allows us to equate changes in the cu spectrum to changes in the system s ` @xmath11 histogram ' for cu .
this is done in fig .
[ fig : figure_cu5ni5](b ) for [ ni@xmath8/cu@xmath8 ] , where we have used @xmath232ev in the simulated spectra . at @xmath10
cu sites exhibit only two possible environments , @xmath12 or 4 , with the former corresponding to the 3 ` central ' monolayers of the 5 monolayer cu stack and the latter corresponding to the 2 ` edge ' monolayers . on the whole cu sites
exhibit higher values of @xmath11 as cu diffuses into the ni region , leading to a shift in the spectrum to low binding energies as @xmath7 increases .
the width of the spectrum increases as the @xmath11 histogram becomes ` flat ' near @xmath214 , and then narrows again as @xmath233 and the histogram tends to that corresponding to the random alloy ni@xmath191cu@xmath191 .
note that , as we found earlier to be the case for the @xmath171 systems , the disorder broadening is not maximized at the random alloy configuration .
an explanation for this is as follows .
the @xmath11 histograms for random alloys - substitutionally disordered systems with homogeneous concentration profiles - are binomial distributions . for inhomogeneous concentration profiles , such as those for [ ni@xmath8/cu@xmath8 ] at @xmath234 ,
the histograms are not constrained to be binomial distributions - they are free to be ` flatter '
. therefore systems with inhomogeneous concentration profiles can exhibit significantly larger disorder broadenings than random alloys - as is borne out in figs .
[ fig : figure_cu5ni5](b ) , [ fig : fwhm_bab ] and [ fig : trajectories_cuni ] .    as another example ,
consider [ ni@xmath226/cu@xmath8 ] , which we earlier pointed out exhibits a disorder narrowing .
[ fig : figure_cu5ni1 ] is analogous to fig .
[ fig : figure_cu5ni5 ] , but for [ ni@xmath226/cu@xmath8 ] .
again , we used @xmath232ev in the simulated spectrum . at @xmath10
the cu sites in the 2 edge monolayers of a 5 monolayer cu stack have @xmath235 , while the cu sites in the 3 central monolayers have @xmath12 .
this is in fact exactly the same situation as for [ ni@xmath8/cu@xmath8 ] . as @xmath7
is increased the cu sites begin to exhibit other values of @xmath11 ; some cu sites begin to ` occupy ' the @xmath236 ` states ' which were unoccupied at @xmath10 .
the same also occurs in [ ni@xmath8/cu@xmath8 ] .
however , comparing figs .
[ fig : figure_cu5ni5 ] and [ fig : figure_cu5ni1 ] it can be seen that there is a significant occupation of the @xmath237 states in [ ni@xmath8/cu@xmath8 ] which does not occur in [ ni@xmath226/cu@xmath8 ] on account of the lack of ni .
hence in [ ni@xmath226/cu@xmath8 ] , loosely speaking , the cu sites spill from their @xmath12 and @xmath235 states into only the @xmath236 states as @xmath7 is increased , which results in a narrowing of the spectrum in this system .    , except that this figure pertains to the alloy system [ ni@xmath226/cu@xmath8].,scaledwidth=50.0% ]      experimental cu spectra for [ ni@xmath8/cu@xmath8 ] and [ ni@xmath8/cu@xmath238 at various temperatures were obtained in refs . .
however , the spectra were found to depend strongly on the material used to cap the sample , and also on the photon energy used @xcite .
this is due to the finite escape depth of the photoelectrons , which leads to cu sites near the surface being ` over - represented ' in the cu spectra .
our model results do not account for such surface effects ; they pertain to the deep bulk .
hence a quantitative comparison between our model results and most of the experimental spectra is meaningless .
the possible exception is the spectra for [ ni@xmath8/cu@xmath8 ] in ref .
taken using a photon energy of 6030ev - which corresponds to a relatively low surface sensitivity .
these spectra reveal a shift of @xmath239ev in [ ni@xmath8/cu@xmath8 ] upon heating over the temperature range corresponding to the transition from @xmath10 to @xmath224 .
this is in excellent agreement with our results : as can be seen from fig .
[ fig : trajectories_cuni ] , from @xmath10 to @xmath224 the model predicts a shift in the cu cls of @xmath239ev for [ ni@xmath8/cu@xmath8 ] . in the future
it would be interesting to perform model calculations which take into account surface effects , and which therefore can be compared directly with the results of refs . .
finally , we consider ternary multilayer systems - consisting of three species @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath170 .
recall that the @xmath1 cls distribution reflects the @xmath1 charge distribution ( eqn . ) , which itself is determined by charge transfer between @xmath1 and non-@xmath1 sites ( eqn . ) . in binary systems eqn .
gives @xmath240 where we have used the fact that @xmath241 .
without loss of generality let @xmath242 , which corresponds to choosing species @xmath92 to be the most electronegative of @xmath92 and @xmath93 . from the above equations it can be seen that the electropositivity difference @xmath184 between species @xmath93 and @xmath92 acts only as a scale factor for the @xmath92 and @xmath93 charge distributions ; altering @xmath184 has no effect on the _ qualitative _ nature of the @xmath92 and @xmath93 charge distributions .
ternary systems are more complicated .
the analogous equation to the above for species @xmath92 in a ternary system is @xmath243.\ ] ] note that altering @xmath184 affects the charge transfer between site @xmath2 and local @xmath93 sites , while leaving the transfer with local @xmath170 sites unaffected ; and conversely if @xmath244 is altered . hence altering @xmath244 or @xmath184 non -
trivially alters the @xmath92 charge distribution . in this sense ternary systems
are extremely rich .
an exhaustive survey of what can be expected from such systems is beyond the scope of this work .
we instead limit ourselves to two ternary systems which we have found to exhibit somewhat counterintuitive behaviors . furthermore , we limit our discussion to the qualitative aspects of these systems , with a focus on understanding these behaviors . for both systems species
@xmath92 is the focus of our attention .
the first ternary system we consider is @xmath245 $ ] .
again , we use eqn . to model the interface roughening ; fig . [
fig : figure_b5a5c5](a ) gives a schematic illustration of the system at the @xmath7 we considered .
for our calculations we set the electropositivities of each species to be @xmath246 , @xmath247 and @xmath248 : the electropositivity of species @xmath92 is exactly halfway between those of species @xmath93 and @xmath170 , with species @xmath93 being the most electronegative and species @xmath170 being the most electropositive . with regards to the other model parameters we set @xmath182 , @xmath249 , @xmath180 , @xmath250 , and @xmath251 . fig . [
fig : figure_b5a5c5](c ) shows the simulated @xmath92 spectra at each @xmath7 . as is evident from the figure , the mean of the @xmath92 cls distribution is independent of @xmath7 . hence here
one can not use the mean to characterize @xmath7 in this system - one must use the fwhm .
this stems from the choice of species electropositivities .
charge transfer from @xmath93 to @xmath92 and @xmath170 to @xmath92 is always equal and opposite on account of the electropositivity of @xmath92 being exactly between that of @xmath93 and @xmath170 .
this , in conjunction with the symmetry of the system , always yields a global mean @xmath92 charge of 0 regardless of @xmath7 , and hence , from eqn .
, a @xmath7-independent mean cls . another interesting feature of this system is that the @xmath10 and @xmath224 spectra are ostensibly indistinguishable . hence unambiguously determining @xmath7 in this system from the @xmath92 spectrum alone is difficult .
the method described earlier for rationalizing spectral changes in binary systems can be extended to ternary systems .
the analogous equation to eqn . for species
@xmath92 in a ternary system is @xmath252 + \phi_a.\ ] ] note that here @xmath6 depends on the environment of @xmath2 through the pair @xmath253 ; there is a mapping from @xmath253 to @xmath6 .
hence the @xmath92 spectrum reflects the ` @xmath253 histogram ' of species @xmath92 .
this is illustrated in fig .
[ fig : figure_b5a5c5](b - c ) . fig .
[ fig : figure_b5a5c5](b ) illustrates the frequency of @xmath92 sites with each @xmath253 ( i.e. , the @xmath253 histogram for species @xmath92 ) , as well as the cls for each @xmath253 - contours of constant cls in ` @xmath253-space ' are drawn .
if an environment @xmath253 is exhibited by a high frequency of sites , then there is a spike in the cls spectrum at the corresponding cls .
this allows rationalization of the evolution of the @xmath92 spectrum with @xmath7 . at @xmath10
there are only 3 possible environments for @xmath92 sites : @xmath254 , which corresponds to a site adjacent to the @xmath93 region ; @xmath255 , which corresponds to a site adjacent to the @xmath170 region ; and @xmath256 , which corresponds to a site in the center of the @xmath92 region - surrounded by @xmath92 sites . at @xmath213 there is a small amount of intermixing at the interfaces .
this leads to @xmath92 sites near the @xmath93 region exhibiting environments @xmath257 , @xmath258 , @xmath259 , etc . ; and @xmath92 sites near the @xmath170 region exhibiting environments @xmath260 , @xmath261 , @xmath262 , etc .
note that at this point no @xmath92 sites have both @xmath93 _ and _ @xmath170 nearest neighbors , and hence the frequency of any environment @xmath253 is only non - zero if @xmath263 or @xmath264 for any @xmath77 . with regards to the spectrum , the ` spreading out ' of the histogram along the left and bottom edges means that environments are exhibited which correspond to more extreme clss , i.e. , @xmath265 and @xmath266 .
hence the spectrum broadens from @xmath10 to 0.75 .
at @xmath267 the interface roughening is large enough that there are @xmath92 sites with both @xmath93 and @xmath170 neighbors , and hence there is a non - zero frequency for environments away from the left and lower edges of the @xmath253 histogram . at @xmath224
we have a ternary random alloy , and the @xmath253 histogram corresponds to that of a trinomial distribution .
/@xmath268/@xmath269 at various @xmath7 ( a ) ; and the corresponding @xmath270 histograms and environment vs. cls maps for species @xmath92 ( b ) , and model spectra ( c ) . in ( b ) , the green - blue squares represents the frequency of @xmath92 sites with the environment @xmath270 , and yellow - red curves are contours of constant cls determined according to eqn . .
in ( c ) the dotted curves are spectra for @xmath10 , and the location of some of the cls contours in ( b ) are also shown.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]      the final system we consider is @xmath271 , with @xmath92 constrained to be immiscible in @xmath93 and @xmath170 , and the electropositivities set to @xmath247 , @xmath272 , and @xmath273 .
the electropositivities correspond to the following situation : species @xmath92 is the most electronegative ; species @xmath93 is the most electropositive ; and species @xmath170 has an intermediate electropositivity very close to that of species @xmath92 .
this system is interesting because , like [ ni@xmath226/cu@xmath8 ] discussed earlier , it exhibits a disorder narrowing .
constraining @xmath92 to be immiscible in @xmath93 and @xmath170 renders eqn .
we therefore instead modeled the interface roughening for this system using the equation @xmath274c^l_x(\sigma=0)\ ] ] for @xmath275 , where we have used the convention that the interface between species @xmath92 and @xmath93 at @xmath10 is located between monolayers 0 and 1 .
the resulting concentration profiles are illustrated in fig .
[ fig : figure_a5b2c](a ) . similarly to fig .
[ fig : figure_b5a5c5 ] , figs . [ fig : figure_a5b2c](b ) and [ fig : figure_a5b2c](c ) show the @xmath253 histogram and simulated spectra for species @xmath92 at each of the considered @xmath7 . for this system we used the same @xmath186 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath183 and @xmath169 as for @xmath245 $ ] .
earlier we saw that [ ni@xmath226/cu@xmath8 ] exhibits a disorder narrowing .
in general , given that the @xmath92 spectrum of a system reflects the @xmath92 charge distribution - as follows from eqn . -
a disorder narrowing for @xmath92 occurs when the introduction of substitutional disorder ` quenches ' the width of the @xmath92 charge distribution .
this occurs here .
species @xmath93 and @xmath92 transfer a certain amount of charge , which results in an @xmath92 charge distribution with a certain width at @xmath10 .
as @xmath7 is increased , more @xmath170 sites come within the charge - transfer range of the @xmath92 region .
given the tiny electropositivity difference between species @xmath92 and @xmath170 , there is almost no charge transfer between @xmath92 and @xmath170 sites .
hence the influx of @xmath170 sites to the @xmath92 interface acts to reduce the charges of the edge @xmath92 sites , bringing them closer to that of the ` non - edge ' @xmath92 sites .
this corresponds to a reduction in the width of the @xmath92 charge distribution , and hence also the core level spectrum .
alternatively , one can explain the disorder narrowing in terms of the evolution of the @xmath253 histogram for species @xmath92 ( fig .
[ fig : figure_a5b2c](b ) ) . at @xmath10
the environment of the @xmath92 sites on the edge monolayer is @xmath254 , which steadily transitions to @xmath276 as @xmath233 .
the latter environment has a cls closer to that of the non - edge @xmath92 sites , i.e. , @xmath277 , and hence the spectrum narrows as @xmath7 is increased .    , except that this figure pertains to the alloy system @xmath268/@xmath278/@xmath170,scaledwidth=50.0% ]
above we have presented a model for core level shifts in alloys , and have used it to add insight into the relationship between atomic environment , charge transfer and disorder broadening in complex systems .
our key result is that the mapping between the distribution of atomic environments and core level spectra is often counterintuitive .
for instance , systems with inhomogeneous concentration profiles can exhibit significantly larger disorder broadenings than is possible in random alloys , and even a ` disorder narrowing ' in some cases .
for the correct interpretation of experimental spectra for complex systems , it is crucially important to understand such phenomena .    the model can be easily adapted to treat other core level spectroscopies , the most prominent of which is auger electron spectroscopy .
hence we expect that it should find widespread use as a framework in which to interpret experimental results .
however , it is by no means a panacea .
recall that the model is underpinned by the nra - cefm - which itself is a particular case of the cefm .
implicit in the nra - cefm are a number of approximations which may be problematic .
one is the _
spherical approximation _ - that only the monopole moments of the charge distribution in each site are considered for the purposes of evaluating the madelung energy .
one must go beyond this approximation in order to obtain a quantitatively accurate description of the electron density within disordered alloys @xcite .
this is especially true for regions near surfaces .
a generalization of the cefm has been described in ref . which does not rely upon the spherical approximation . while the nra - cefm could be generalized in an analogous manner , it is not clear whether this would be fruitful .
the strength of the nra - cefm over the ` general ' cefm is its simplicity , with which comes a small loss in accuracy relative to the cefm .
it is not clear whether the gain in accuracy achieved by generalizing the nra - cefm to go beyond the spherical approximation is worth the resulting loss in simplicity .
another potentially problematic approximation implicit in the nra - cefm is that the nuclei of the system under consideration form an undistorted crystal lattice .
the breakdown of this approximation can have far - reaching consequences .
the addition of distortions to the crystal lattice of cuau results in a reversal of the average relationship between a site s cls and its number of unlike nearest neighbors @xcite . the reasons for this are not known , and warrant further investigation .
the nra - cefm , suitably modified to treat lattice distortions , may add insight into this phenomenon , though it would be optimistic to expect that anything more than a qualitative understanding could be achieved .
it should be borne in mind that the aforementioned approximations , while implicit in the nra - cefm , are also utilized in many _
ab initio _ calculations , and are not expected to preclude the model from making _ at least _ qualitatively accurate predictions
. a more problematic limitation of the model is that its free parameters are not known _ a priori _ : they must be obtained from _ ab initio _ calculations or by other means .
fortunately these parameters are highly transferable between systems ; for details see refs . . in the future
we intend to calculate these parameters for a wide range of alloys .
this would enable the model to be readily applied to many systems ." ," in alloys exhibiting substitutional disorder , the variety of atomic environments manifests itself as a ` disorder broadening ' in their core level binding energy spectra . 
 disorder broadening can be measured experimentally , and in principle can be used to deduce information about specific atomic environments within a sample . 
 however , progress in this endeavor is hampered by the lack of a model for this phenomenon which can treat complex systems . in this work 
 we describe such a model . 
 the model is used to elucidate the relationship between charge transfer , atomic environment , and disorder broadening in complex systems , with a focus on the problem of characterizing the interface quality of cuni multilayers . 
 we also validate the model against the results of _ ab initio _ electronic structure calculations . 
 several counterintuitive aspects of the disorder broadening phenomenon are uncovered , an understanding of which is essential for the correct interpretation of experimental results . 
 for instance , it is shown that systems with inhomogeneous concentration profiles can exhibit disorder broadenings significantly larger than random alloys . furthermore in some systems 
 a ` disorder narrowing ' is even possible . "
"it is now more than decade that the properties of the new state of matter called quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) are studied with the ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions at rhic and the lhc . among many expected results
there are also a few outstanding surprises .
in particular , broad analysis of the particle correlations @xcite in the experimental data revealed that , in contrast to the earlier expectations based on the asymptotic freedom property of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , the qgp is a strongly coupled system with the lowest viscosity in nature .
moreover , it is surprisingly well described within the effective framework of relativistic dissipative fluid dynamics .
unfortunately , predictive power of the latter , required for the ongoing precision studies , is highly limited due to the requirement of the precise knowledge of its initial conditions .
in particular , one has only qualitative information on the amplitude of the viscous corrections just after the collision , which , apart from resulting in possible quantitative differences in the predicted results , may question applicability of the viscous fluid dynamics in such modelling in general @xcite .
thus , the study of the approach of the created qgp toward the local thermal equilibrium ( _ thermalization _ ) is nowadays of highest interest for the field of heavy - ion physics @xcite .    in this proceedings contribution
we briefly review our main results of the study of the qgp thermalization rate within the framework of the color - flux - tube model proposed in ref .
@xcite . based on the detailed analysis of the transverse - momentum spectra of the produced partons
@xcite we show that it is difficult to fully thermalize the system within a short time ( @xmath0 fm ) unless the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio is that of ads / cft lower bound , @xmath1 @xcite .
however , at the same time , for @xmath2 the observed deviations from equilibrium state are quite well described within dissipative corrections of viscous hydrodynamics .
the latter observation confirms the fast hydrodynamization of the qgp first proposed in ref .
based on the saturation physics @xcite , due to the ultra - relativistic energies , most of particles produced in midrapidity of heavy - ion collisions originate from the decay of purely longitudinal color fields spanned by the receding color - charged nuclei . in refs .  @xcite it was proposed to describe this physics situation within the simplified model of initial color electric flux tube @xcite treated in the abelian dominance approximation @xcite which subsequently decays into quarks and gluons according to the schwinger tunneling mechanism @xcite . within this
framework phase - space densities of quarks , antiquarks and charged gluons are described by the following kinetic boltzmann - vlasov - type equations @xmath3 respectively . in eqs .
( [ kineaq ] ) partons couple to the mean color field @xmath4 through the charges @xmath5 ( for quarks ) , @xmath6 ( for antiquarks ) , and @xmath7 ( for gluons ) @xcite , where the color indices @xmath8 run from 1 to 3 .
the first terms on the right hand side of eqs .
( [ kineaq ] ) denote the particle production due to the schwinger tunnelling @xcite .
in addition to the usual treatment we include the subsequent collisions between produced particles through the collisional kernels treated in the relaxation time approximation ( rta ) @xcite @xmath9 where the relaxation time is expressed according to the anderson - witting formula @xmath10 @xcite .    in the case of boost - invariant and transversely homogeneous system , also called the bjorken symmetry @xcite , the solutions of eqs .
( [ kineaq ] ) depend only on the proper time , @xmath11 , transverse momentum , @xmath12 , and the boost - invariant variable , @xmath13 , i.e. , @xmath14 , and may be found analytically @xcite .
in order to study approach of the system toward the local thermal equilibrium one typically analyses the deviations of pressures from the equilibrium pressure , see ref .  @xcite .
alternatively , one can also study the @xmath12 spectra of the produced partons , and their approach toward the equilibrium spectrum @xcite .
for that purpose we use cooper - frye formula @xcite , which for the bjorken symmetry @xcite considered herein reduces to the following form @xmath15 where @xmath16 arbitrarily sets the transverse size in such a way that the integral ( [ cfbi ] ) gives the production per unit area .
we assume that the phase - space distribution @xmath17 in eq .
( [ cfbi ] ) is given by the sum of the quark , antiquark and gluon distribution functions satisfying transport equations ( [ kineaq ] ) , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the number of flavours .
for the results presented herein we use the solutions from ref .
@xcite obtained for the initial field strength corresponding to the lhc case .
in the left panels of fig .  [ sp1 ] we present the partonic @xmath12 spectra obtained using eqs .
( [ cfbi ] ) and ( [ f ] ) for two values of the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio , @xmath20 ( top ) and @xmath21 ( bottom ) , and various freeze - out proper times .
we observe that , except for the low-@xmath12 range , in all cases the spectra have approximately thermal - like ( exponential ) shape .
this property , sometimes called _ apparent thermalization _
, is , however , mainly related to the specific production mechanism of partons , which in our case is the schwinger tunnelling in the oscillating color field @xcite .    in order to judge
if the thermalization is really achieved we propose to study the corresponding _ negative inverse logarithmic slopes _ , @xmath22 , of the spectra , @xmath23^{-1}.\label{slope}\ ] ]     +   +    in the right panels of fig .
[ sp1 ] we compare the slopes @xmath22 of the spectra from the left panels with the corresponding slopes of the spectra of the viscous fluid , @xmath24 having the same energy density @xmath25 . in eq .
( [ lvisc ] ) @xmath26 and @xmath27 , with @xmath28 and @xmath29 being the longitudinal and transverse pressure , respectively . in the special case of the system in local thermal equlibrium , @xmath30 ,
the formula ( [ lvisc ] ) reduces to the one for the perfect fluid , @xmath31 from the fig .
[ sp1 ] we observe that , although the spectra look approximately thermal for all @xmath32 , only in the case of @xmath20 the slopes @xmath22 agree with the equilibrium ones @xmath33 within a short proper - time ( @xmath0 fm ) .
this suggest that the system undergo fast thermalization only in the case of maximal possible coupling . on the other hand ,
the discrepancies at medium and large @xmath12 observed for @xmath34 ( bottom panel ) are very well addressed within the dissipative corrections of the viscous fluid dynamics , see @xmath35 .
it means that although the fast thermalization seems to be limited to @xmath20 , the system may still undergo fast hydrodynamization if @xmath36 .
the thermalization rate of the quark - gluon plasma produced from the initial color electric flux tubes through the schwiner mechanism is studied .
once produced the partons are interacting with each other according to the collisional kernels treated in rta .
the detailed comparison of the resulting transverse - momentum spectra of partons with the viscous hydrodynamics ones is done .
obtained results suggest that , although the early thermalization may be limited to strongly coupled systems ( @xmath37 ) , as long as @xmath36 the early hydrodynamization of the plasma in such reactions may be achieved .

"in the present work the equation @xmath0 , \label{i1}\ ] ] is studied , where @xmath1 is a real number , @xmath2 , @xmath3 is a complex - valued continuous function on @xmath4 $ ] satisfying a growth bound @xmath5 at the origin for some @xmath6 , @xmath7   $ ] are complex valued functions , and @xmath8 is a ( complex ) spectral parameter . denote @xmath9 .
equations of the form ( [ i1 ] ) appear naturally in many real - world applications after a separation of variables and therefore have received considerable attention ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . in preceding publications equation ( [ i1 ] )
was studied under more restrictive conditions , typically for @xmath3 and @xmath10 being real - valued and @xmath11 . the approach developed in this work
does not imply such restrictions and serves both for qualitative study of solutions and spectral problems , as well as for related numerical computation .
the main component in the developed approach is a spectral parameter power series ( spps ) representation for the regular solution of ( [ i1 ] ) obtained under the condition that the auxiliary equation @xmath12 possesses a regular solution which does not have zeros on @xmath13 $ ] except at @xmath14 .
the spps representation for solutions of nonsingular linear differential equations and its applications in corresponding scattering and spectral problems were studied in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and some other papers . here ,
in section [ sect2 ] we obtain an analogous result for the perturbed bessel equation ( [ i1 ] ) .
the construction and the existence of the required particular solution are addressed in section [ sect3 ] .
for example , when @xmath15 , @xmath16 $ ] such nonvanishing on @xmath4 $ ] solution exists .
we give an analytic representation for it together with an estimate .
let us emphasize that , in general , @xmath17 is allowed to be a complex - valued function , and the existence of such @xmath17 for a complex valued @xmath3 is an open problem .    under the assumption that @xmath17 exists we obtain a dispersion ( characteristic ) relation for the sturm - liouville problem for ( [ i1 ] ) on @xmath13 $ ] , @xmath18 ( theorem [ thmspectralproblem ] ) .
namely , we construct an entire function @xmath19 in the form of a taylor series such that the set of its zeros coincides with the set of all eigenvalues of the sturm - liouville problem
. this immediately implies the discreteness of the spectrum and offers an efficient method for its computation .    in practical applications of the spps method
it is often convenient to consider not only series with the centre in the origin @xmath20 but also series with the centre at @xmath21 where @xmath22 is some complex number . in section [ sectspshift ]
we show that this spectral parameter shifting technique is applicable to equation ( [ i1 ] ) and give necessary details .
the spps representation allows us to obtain a result on mapping properties of the transmutation operator corresponding to the operator @xmath23 , which was studied , e.g. , in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .
we show in section [ secttransmut ] how the transmutation operator acts on certain powers of the independent variable . in the case of nonsingular schrdinger operators
a result of this kind allowed us to advance in the construction of the transmutation operator itself @xcite and had applications in constructing complete systems of solutions for some partial differential equations @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    in section [ sectnumeric ]
we explain the numerical implementation of the developed spps method for solving sturm - liouville problems for ( [ i1 ] ) .
first , we consider several known test problems , and comparing the obtained results with the results obtained by the best available codes , as sleign2 , matslise and some others , we show that our method is highly competitive and gives better or at least comparable results on test problems to which other codes are applicable .
second , we consider an example which involves a different from zero @xmath24 in ( [ i1 ] ) and a complex spectrum .
meanwhile sleign2 and matslise are not applicable to problems admitting complex eigenvalues , our method delivers results which are in excellent agreement with the exact data .

when @xmath11 , i.e. , the right hand side of does not depend on the derivative of @xmath65 , the estimates of lemma [ lemmaxtildeestimate ] can be improved , and the following statement is valid .
[ lemmaxtildeestimatezeror1 ] under the conditions of lemma [ lemmaxtildeestimate ] assume additionally that @xmath11 . then the functions @xmath45 defined by or satisfy the inequalities @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the pochhammer symbol and @xmath68 , where the constants @xmath52 and @xmath53 are such that for any @xmath55 $ ] the following inequalities hold @xmath69    the proof is analogous to that of lemma [ lemmaxtildeestimate ] .
the following theorem presents the spectral parameter power series ( spps ) representation of a bounded solution of equation .

for a regular sturm - liouville problem the existence and the construction of the required non - vanishing solution @xmath17 present no difficulty since the equation possesses two linearly independent real - valued solutions @xmath83 and @xmath84 whose zeros alternate and one may choose @xmath85 as such solution .
for the singular equation under consideration there is only one solution satisfying the asymptotic conditions and , see theorem [ thmspectralproblem ] .
corollary [ corrnonvanishingps ] establishes that such non - vanishing solution @xmath17 exists in the case when @xmath86 , @xmath16 $ ] , and in remark [ rmkbddq ] we show that a modified spps representation is always possible in the case when @xmath3 is real valued and bounded from below and @xmath24 is real valued .    for spps representations for solutions of nonsingular sturm - liouville equations we refer to @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .

was obtained and used in @xcite but without formulas for constructing or estimating the coefficients @xmath88 .    for practical applications
the partial sums of the series are of the main interest .
based on lemmas [ lemmaxtildeestimate ] and [ lemmaxtildeestimatezeror1 ] the following corollary provides estimates for the difference between the exact solution and the approximate one defined as a partial sum of the series .
the difference is estimated in terms of the remainders of taylor series of two special functions .

the asymptotic relations and for the function @xmath79 follow from the estimates @xmath121 and @xmath122 , @xmath123 for @xmath82 , see and .
inequality follows from the series representation of the modified bessel functions of the first kind , see , e.g. , @xcite .
the following corollary provides a sufficient condition for the particular solution constructed in proposition [ proppartsol ] to be non - vanishing .

the classical formulation ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) of a spectral problem for a sturm - liouville equation of the form @xmath129 with @xmath23 from consists in finding the values of the spectral parameter for which there exists a solution @xmath130 continuous at @xmath14 and satisfying the following conditions . when @xmath131 , @xmath132 and @xmath133 for some @xmath134 such that @xmath135 .
when @xmath136 and since the second linearly independent solution is also square - integrable , an additional boundary condition @xmath137 is imposed ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    despite the fact that the right - hand side of the spectral equation may contain the derivative of the unknown function and hence not fit into the basic sturm - liouville scheme , we consider the same spectral problem  for equation .
the following statement gives us a characteristic equation of the spectral problem under the condition that an appropriate non - vanishing solution @xmath79 of exists .

the boundary condition for the function @xmath65 coincides with @xmath140 , and @xmath19 is an entire function by theorem [ thmsingularspps ] .
it is left to show that there are no more eigenvalues .
for that it is sufficient to show that the second linearly independent solution @xmath141 of does not satisfy either or .
we rewrite in the form @xmath142 and introduce the function @xmath143 note that @xmath144 since the solution @xmath65 defined by satisfies the asymptotic condition , there exists a constant @xmath145 such that @xmath146 for all @xmath147 $ ]

taking into account we have @xmath163 as can be seen from , @xmath164 , hence only the first term is relevant . since @xmath165 as @xmath123 ,
it is sufficient to prove that @xmath166 .
similarly to we obtain that the general solution of equation can be represented as @xmath167 , where @xmath168 is given by and satisfies the asymptotic condition and @xmath169 satisfies the asymptotic condition @xmath170 , @xmath123 . since @xmath171 by the statement of the theorem , it is necessarily of the form . now using , and we obtain @xmath172 where @xmath173 participates in , and this finishes the proof for @xmath155 .
the spps representation given in theorem [ thmsingularspps ] is based on a particular solution of equation for @xmath20 . in @xcite
it was mentioned that for a classic sturm - liouville equation it is also possible to construct the spps representation of a general solution starting from a non - vanishing particular solution for some @xmath21 .
such procedure is called spectral shift and has already proven its usefulness for numerical applications @xcite , @xcite .
we show that a spectral shift technique may be applied to equation .
let @xmath22 be a fixed complex number .
we rewrite in the form @xmath174 where @xmath175 .

then the operator @xmath177 admits the following plya factorization @xcite @xmath178 where @xmath179 based on the factorization we introduce the following system of recursive integrals @xmath180\,dt , & \text{if } n\text { is odd},\\ -\displaystyle\int_{0}^{x}\frac{\widetilde{z}^{(n-1)}(t)}{p(t)u_{0}^{2}(t)}\,dt , & \text{if } n\text { is even}. \end{cases } \end{split } \label{ztilde}\ ] ] similarly to the recurrent relation can be rewritten as @xmath181(t)\widetilde{z}^{(n-1)}(t)-r_{1}(t)\widetilde{z}^{(n-2)}(t)\bigr)\,dt , & \text{if } n\text { is odd},\\ -\displaystyle\int_{0}^{x}\frac{\widetilde{z}^{(n-1)}(t)}{p(t)u_{0}^{2}(t)}\,dt , & \text{if } n\text { is even}. \end{cases } \label{ztildealt}\ ] ]    [ thmspectralshift ] let admit a solution @xmath182\cap c^{2}(0,a]$ ] ( in general , complex - valued ) which does not have other zeros on @xmath13 $ ] except at @xmath14 and satisfies the asymptotic relations and . then for any @xmath183 the function @xmath184 is a solution of belonging to @xmath72\cap c^{2}(0,a]$ ] , and the series converges uniformly on @xmath13 $ ] .

estimates for @xmath187 justify the possibility of differentiation of the involved series and show that the function @xmath65 satisfies and .

the particular solution of this equation can be constructed similarly to section [ sectpartsol ] using the generalization of formulas according to the factorization , cf . , and .
since the functions @xmath186 and @xmath194 are non - negative , similarly to corollary [ corrnonvanishingps ] we deduce that the particular solution @xmath17 in such case does not have other zeros on @xmath13 $ ] except at @xmath14 .
hence it is possible to construct the spps representation of the bounded solution for any equation having a real - valued @xmath24 and a real - valued bounded from below @xmath3 .    in the case
when @xmath11 , we do not need to introduce the new system of functions @xmath187 .

we recall a general definition of a transmutation operator from @xcite which is a modification of the definition given by levitan @xcite .
let @xmath198 be a linear topological space and @xmath199 its linear subspace ( not necessarily closed ) .
let @xmath200 and @xmath201 be linear operators : @xmath202 .    [ deftransmut ] a linear invertible operator @xmath203 defined on the whole @xmath198 such that @xmath199 is invariant under the action of @xmath203
is called a transmutation operator for the pair of operators @xmath200 and @xmath201 if it fulfills the following two conditions .    1 .   both the operator @xmath203 and its inverse @xmath204 are continuous in @xmath198 ; 2 .
the following operator equality is valid @xmath205 or which is the same @xmath206    very often in literature the transmutation operators ( the term coined by delsarte and lions @xcite ) are called transformation operators .    in @xcite for the case of the transmutation operator @xmath203 corresponding to the pair of operators @xmath207 and @xmath208 a mapping property of @xmath203 was found .
it establishes what is the result of action of @xmath203 on the powers of the independent variable .
this mapping property already found many applications in the proofs of completeness of infinite systems of solutions of some linear partial differential equations and in solving initial and spectral problems , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .
we present an analogue of the aforementioned mapping property for the transmutation operator for the pair of operators @xmath209 and @xmath210 , constructed in @xcite , @xcite .
we recall some results from @xcite , @xcite . under certain additional conditions on the potential @xmath3 , discussed below
, a bounded solution of the equation @xmath211 can be represented in the form @xmath212 where @xmath213 is a solution of the equation @xmath214 and @xmath99 is the bessel function of the first kind .
the integral kernel @xmath215 is the solution of the partial differential equation @xmath216 satisfying the boundary conditions @xmath217 moreover , the integral kernel @xmath215 satisfies @xmath218    we denote the operator defined by as @xmath219 .
the existence of such operator was established in @xcite for the case when @xmath3 is a continuous function on @xmath13 $ ] and in @xcite for the case when @xmath1 is an integer and @xmath3 is a real - valued function satisfying the condition @xmath220 for some @xmath221 .
it is mentioned in @xcite that the results of @xcite allow one to extend the existence of the operator @xmath219 onto arbitrary real values of the parameter @xmath1 .
the solution @xmath222 in differs from the solution @xmath223 satisfying the asymptotic condition by the factor @xmath224 , see @xcite .
the series expansion of the function @xmath225 is @xmath226 similarly to ( * ? ? ?
* theorem 7 ) we substitute the functions @xmath222 and @xmath225 in by their series expansions and and obtain @xmath227 .

, we finally obtain that @xmath233 = ( -1)^{k } 2^{2k } k !
\bigl(l+\frac32\bigr)_{k } u_{0}(x ) \widetilde x^{(2k)}(x).\ ] ]
based on the results of the previous sections we can formulate a numerical method for solving spectral problems for perturbed bessel equations .    1 .
find a particular solution @xmath17 of equation satisfying the asymptotic conditions and .
note that due to the proof of theorem [ thmspectralproblem ] it is sufficient to check that the solution satisfies only the asymptotic condition .
if an analytic expression for the particular solution is unknown , one can use a numerical approximation suggested by proposition [ proppartsol ] .
2 .   check that the particular solution @xmath17 obtained in step 1 is non - vanishing for @xmath16 $ ] . under the conditions of corollary [ corrnonvanishingps ]
it is always the case .
if the particular solution has zeros on @xmath4 $ ] , the spectral shift technique described in section [ sectspshift ] can help , either directly as described in remark [ rmkbddq ] or by finding a suitable value of @xmath22 , complex in general .
3 .   use partial sums of the series and ( or , correspondingly , and ) to obtain a polynomial @xmath234 approximating the characteristic function .
find zeros of the calculated polynomial @xmath235 .
5 .   to improve the accuracy of the eigenvalues located farther from the point @xmath22 , the spectral parameter corresponding to the current particular solution , perform one or several steps of the spectral shift technique .
since the characteristic function @xmath19 is analytic , the rouch theorem from complex analysis , see , e.g. , @xcite , provides the stability of the numerical procedure .
indeed , let @xmath236 be an arbitrary simple closed contour on which @xmath237 does not vanish
. then if the absolute error of approximation @xmath238 is less than @xmath239 on @xmath236 , due to rouch s theorem the functions @xmath240 and @xmath241 possess the same number of zeros inside @xmath236 .
hence the procedure described above does not produce additional ( or on the contrary less ) zeros whenever @xmath240 approximates well enough the function @xmath237 .
we illustrate this point below , in example [ ex6 ] .    before considering numerical examples
let us explain how the numerical implementation of the spps method was done in this work .
all the calculations were performed with the help of matlab 2010 in the double precision machine arithmetics .
the formal powers @xmath195 were calculated using the newton - cottes 6 point integration formula of 7-th order , see , e.g. , @xcite , modified to perform indefinite integration .
we choose @xmath242 equally spaced points covering the segment of interest and apply the integration formula to overlapping groups of six points .
it is worth mentioning that for large values of the parameter @xmath1 a special care should be taken near the point @xmath243 , because even small errors in the values of @xmath244 after the division by @xmath245 lead to large errors in the computation of @xmath246 on the whole interval @xmath13 $ ] . to overcome this difficulty we change the values of @xmath244 in several points near zero to their asymptotic values .
this strategy leads to a good accuracy .
the computation of the first 100200 formal powers proved to be a completely feasible task , and even for @xmath242 being as large as several millions the computation time of the whole set of formal powers is within seconds . in the presented numerical results we specify two parameters :
@xmath247 is the degree of the polynomial @xmath240 in , i.e. , the number of the calculated formal powers is @xmath248 , and @xmath242 is the number of points taken on the considered segment for the calculation of integrals .
let us stress that the formal powers do not depend on the spectral parameter and once calculated can be used for computing the solution and/or the characteristic function @xmath19 for thousands of different values of the spectral parameter @xmath8 without any additional significant computation cost .    there exist several computer codes for the solution of singular sturm - liouville problems .
we compare our results with the results produced by sleign2 @xcite and matslise @xcite .
both packages can reliably solve a variety of spectral problems for regular and singular sturm - liouville problems and are considered as basic comparison tools , the second package to our best knowledge is one of the most accurate . both packages work with double precision machine arithmetics and were used with the parameters for the highest possible accuracy goals .
it should be mentioned that the applicability of both packages is restricted to the self - adjoint situation and they do not permit neither complex coefficients nor a first order differential operator at a spectral parameter .
thus , to illustrate the performance of the proposed method in a situation when a comparison to the existing software is impossible , in example [ ex6 ] we consider a problem for which an exact characteristic equation can be written down and compare the obtained numerical results to those calculated from the exact equation .
[ ex1]our first numerical example is the bessel equation , which we already touched on in example [ examplebessel ] .
consider the following spectral problem ( * ? ? ?
* example 2 ) @xmath249 in this and in all other considered examples the solution @xmath222 should also satisfy the boundary conditions and at 0 .
as follows from , the eigenvalues of the problem coincide with zeros of the bessel function @xmath250 , where @xmath251 and @xmath252 .
we compare the results delivered by the spps method to those from ( * ? ? ?
* example 2 ) for a particular case @xmath253 .
for the spps representation the exact particular solution @xmath254 was used .
the results are presented in table [ ex1table1 ] together with the exact eigenvalues calculated as squares of zeros of @xmath255 and computed using the matlab routine ` besselzero.m ` by greg von winckel .

47628560802 +    as can be seen from table [ ex1table1 ] , the accuracy of the higher eigenvalues calculated by the spps method decreases . to improve the accuracy the spectral shift technique described in section [ sectspshift ]
is applied .
we choose that the values of the parameter @xmath22 change along a line in the complex plane and are given by @xmath256 , @xmath257 . on each step
we compute the solution in the next point @xmath258 and use this solution as a particular solution for the next step .
since the spectral problem has a purely real spectrum , among the zeros of the approximating polynomial the ones with a small imaginary part are chosen and those which are closer to the number @xmath259 than to any other of the numbers @xmath260 , @xmath261 are stored .
the obtained results are presented in table [ ex1table2 ] together with the used values of @xmath22 for the spectral shift and the exact eigenvalues . in the first column of the table
we combine the results produced by the matslise package with the exact eigenvalues because in this case all the presented digits coincide .    as can be seen from table [ ex1table2 ]
, the spectral shift technique allows us to significantly improve the obtained results for the higher eigenvalues . from now on we present only the results obtained with the help of the spectral shift technique and specify the implemented rules for choosing spectral shifts .

contrary to the case of a purely real spectrum we can not simply discard all roots whose imaginary part is greater than some @xmath314 .
instead , rouch s theorem and estimate suggest that the roots closest to the origin ( or to the current centre @xmath315 when the spectral shift is used ) can not be the spurious roots .
we give an illustration of application of this theorem .
according to rouch s theorem we need to find such values of the radius @xmath316 that @xmath317 establishing that the numbers of zeros of the functions @xmath313 and @xmath19 coincide inside the disk @xmath318 .
we calculate @xmath319 using the spps representation . to estimate the difference @xmath320 we use .
according to lemma [ lemmaxtildeestimate ] , for problem one can take @xmath321 .
we present the obtained results on figure [ figcomplexrouche ] for @xmath322 and @xmath323 where it is compared to @xmath324 calculated with the aid of the exact characteristic function .
as can be seen from the graphs , when we use the exact characteristic function for the estimation of the error the largest values of @xmath316 for which inequality holds are @xmath325 and @xmath326 .
the estimate delivers rougher estimates , @xmath327 and @xmath328 . on figure [ ex6fig ]
we show the graph of @xmath329 together with the boundary of the disk @xmath330 .
the peaks on the graph correspond to the roots of the polynomial @xmath331 .
only six of them are located in the disk and hence should be considered as approximations to the eigenvalues .
all other roots are located outside the disk and hence should be discarded .    to calculate the higher order eigenvalues
, we applied the spectral shift technique described in section [ sectspshift ] .
the following strategy for choosing the values of the spectral shift was implemented .
let @xmath332 be the spectral shift on the @xmath43-th step and @xmath333 the already found eigenvalues .
based on the representations and we calculate the roots of the polynomial @xmath334 and reorder them with respect to the distance from @xmath332 . from these ordered roots we choose the closest to the point @xmath332 and sufficiently distant from @xmath333 .
we denote this root as @xmath335 and set @xmath336 , where @xmath337 is a fixed displacement . performing this procedure with @xmath338 , @xmath339 , @xmath322 and @xmath340 we obtained the list of eigenvalues presented in table [ ex6table2 ] .
the eigenvalues are ordered according to their distance to the origin . as can be seen from the table
the approximate eigenvalues are calculated with a remarkable accuracy .

( in russian )" ," a spectral parameter power series ( spps ) representation for regular solutions of singular bessel type sturm - liouville equations with complex coefficients is obtained as well as an spps representation for the ( entire ) characteristic function of the corresponding spectral problem on a finite interval . 
 it is proved that the set of zeros of the characteristic function coincides with the set of all eigenvalues of the sturm - liouville problem . 
 based on the spps representation a new mapping property of the transmutation operator for the considered perturbed bessel operator is obtained , and a new numerical method for solving corresponding spectral problems is developed . 
 the range of applicability of the method includes complex coefficients , complex spectrum and equations in which the spectral parameter stands at a first order linear differential operator . on a set of known test problems 
 we show that the developed numerical method based on the spps representation is highly competitive in comparison to the best available solvers such as sleign2 , matslise and some other codes and give an example of an exactly solvable test problem admitting complex eigenvalues to which the mentioned solvers are not applicable meanwhile the spps method delivers excellent numerical results .

"bleeker @xcite reviewed in general terms the prospects and results of the bepposax wide field camera instrument package ( `` wfcs '' ) .
the unique capability of matching a wide field of view of @xmath1 per each of two identical cameras with a good angular resolution of 5  @xcite not only led to a revolution of gamma - ray burst research ( e.g. , @xcite ) but also to a serious advance of our knowledge on x - ray bursts and other transient emission processes in low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) .
much of the relevant data was acquired during the only dedicated bepposax observation program involving the wfcs as prime instrument .
this encompasses observations pointed at the galactic center during semi - yearly visibility windows that lasted from mid february to mid april and from mid august to mid october .
table  [ tab1 ] summarizes the twelve campaigns during the six - year bepposax lifetime .
the combined exposure time represents 8% of the total bepposax exposure budget .
the success of this program may be anticipated by the mere fact that the field of view of one wfc emcompasses more than half the galactic lmxb population according to pre - wfc catalogs @xcite .
another important ingredient for the success is that nearly all observations were analyzed in a near to real - time fashion .
this was possible thanks to the 24 hr per day , 7 days a week , manning of the bepposax science operations center ( which was also crucial to the success of the grb program of bepposax @xcite ) and the dedicated support by the duty scientists.    tied to this program a dedicated target - of - opportunity program was in place for the bepposax narrow field instruments ( nfis ) to follow up new transients or bursters .
this program was triggered 14 times , with exposure times between 20 and 40 ksec .
whenever new transients or bursters were discovered , these were announced in iau circulars .
this happened on 20 occasions and triggered independent too programs on bepposax , the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) , xmm - newton , and ground - based radio and optical telescopes , illustrating a community service of the wfc program .
.wfc observation campaigns on the galactic center .
the effective exposure times are for the position of the galactic center . adapted from @xcite.[tab1 ] [ cols='^,^ , > , > ' , ]     ) and the rxte asm ( horizontal lines , solid for the detection , dotted for upper limits ; from @xcite ) .
the dashed line indicates exponential decay with e - folding time 5 days .
the v indicates the time of the optical observations ( see fig .
[ figfrankopt ] ) .
[ figfrank ] ]    when browsing through the list ( table  [ tab3 ] ) it is striking that there are only 8 out of the 36 transients that reached peak fluxes in excess of 0.2 crab units ; a substantial fraction of 13 out of 36 is even fainter than 0.05 crab .
sometimes this is accompanied by a short duration , but this is not the rule ( e.g. , @xcite ) .
an example of this is given in fig .
[ figfrank ] which presents the light curve of the 1998 outburst of sax j1748.9 - 2021 in the globular cluster ngc 6440 which had an e - folding decay time as short as 5  d. a further noteworthy detail is that most ( 22 ) transients burst and , thus , contain a neutron star . the low outburst peak fluxes indicate sub - eddington luminosities for a canonical 8  kpc distance .
the fact that the observations have detected recurrence in half of all transients suggests that a fair fraction of the lmxb transients with recurrence times below a few years and on - times longer than a few days have now been discovered in this field . assuming that the sample is complete and that this field represents half the total galactic population
, there must be roughly 40 such transients in total .
quicker transients , such as sax  j1748.9 - 2021 @xcite or sax  j1810.8 - 2609 @xcite , are more elusive unless they recur often enough ( such as v4641  sgr , see table  [ tab3 ] ) .
there are 150 globular clusters in the galaxy and 12 contain 13 luminous lmxbs ( m15 has two ) . in a number of clusters , considerable quantities of quiescent lmxbs have been found .
pooley et al .
@xcite estimate a total of 100 mostly quiescent lmxbs in galactic globular clusters .
thus , it is obvious that lmxbs are abundant in clusters ; for instance , luminous lmxbs are 100 times more abundant than in the galactic disk , in terms of number per unit mass @xcite .
the nature of the compact accretor has been determined in 12 of the 13 cases as neutron stars through the detection of type - i x - ray bursts .
the wfcs have established three of these bursters ( see table  [ tab2 ] )
. the one unresolved case , ac211 in m15 , has recently been argued to contain a neutron star as well on the basis of an optical study @xcite .
furthermore , ac211 is a persistent source while all black hole lmxbs are transient .
thus , another disk versus cluster difference concerns the number ratio of black holes to neutron stars in lmxbs .
none of the luminous cluster lmxbs has a confirmed or even a suspected black hole ( 0/13 ) , while there are 37 cases in the galactic disk ( of which 15 dynamically confirmed and 22 suspected ; @xcite ) .
the difference is not very significant though .
if the same disk ratio of 37/150 applies to globular clusters as well , there would be a 3% probability that no black hole systems would be found in a random sample of 13 .
the wfcs made interesting observations of two particular luminous globular cluster lmxbs .
the first concerns ngc 6440 .
no x - ray outburst was detected from this cluster since january 1972 @xcite , but in august 1998 the wfcs detected an outburst which included first - time observations of x - ray bursts .
follow - up observations were carried out with the bepposax - nfi and rosat , and fig .
[ figfrank ] shows the combined light curve .
the transient lasted only a little over a week , and the peak flux was about 50  mcrab .
follow - up observations were also carried out at high spatial resolution in the optical .
comparison with later observations when the transient was off revealed the first - time detection of an optical counterpart to an x - ray transient in a globular cluster , see fig .
[ figfrankopt ] @xcite .
this identification was later confirmed by chandra high - resolution x - ray observations during another outburst @xcite . the fact that some outbursts last very short makes clear that a swift response of follow - up observations is sometimes imperative .
the other interesting wfc observation of a luminous cluster lmxb concerns terzan  6 .
first detected by granat @xcite and rosat @xcite in 1990 , wfc and rxte observations showed that this is a transient with a very regular outburst pattern @xcite like in the rapid burster and aql x-1 with a ( quasi ) period of 4.5 months . by combining wfc data from the first half of the mission it was found that this transient is one of now six known completely eclipsing lmxbs in the galaxy .
the orbital period of 12.4  hr is typical for an lmxb .
the results of the galactic center campaigns of the bepposax wfcs are plentiful .
this is mainly due to its large field of view which enabled to monitor a large fraction of the galactic lmxb population and resulted in a large exposure of roughly 7 million seconds over six years on tens of sources .
such an exposure has not been accomplished by any other device yet .
thus , it has been possible to detect rare phenomena such as superbursts , burst - only sources and swift transients ( e.g. , v4641 sgr ) .
the analysis of wfc data will continue and new results are expected to come out .
this particularly concerns time scales of a few hours and the longest time scales , and weak signals ( e.g. , x - ray bursts fainter than 0.5  crab ) .
the success of the galactic center campaign was in part made possible by the round - the - clock dedication of the duty scientists at the bepposax science operations center in rome and we thank them for their efforts .

 this pertains to the study of luminous low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) . 
 when pointed at the galactic center , the wfc field of view contains more than half of the galactic lmxb population . 
 the results exemplify the excellent wfc capability to detect brief x - ray transients . 
 firstly , the wfcs expanded the known population of galactic thermonuclear x - ray bursters by 50% . 
 at least half of all lmxbs are now established to burst and , thus , to contain a neutron star as compact accretor rather than a black hole candidate . 
 we provide a complete list of all 76 currently known bursters , including the new case 1rxs j170854.4 - 321857 . 
 secondly , the wfcs have uncovered a population of weak transients with peak luminosities up to @xmath0  and durations from days to weeks . 
 one is the first accretion - powered millisecond pulsar sax  j1808.4 - 3658 . 
 thirdly , the wfcs contributed considerably towards establishing that nearly all ( 12 out of 13 ) luminous low - mass x - ray binaries in galactic globular clusters contain neutron stars rather than black holes . 
 thus , the neutron star to black hole ratio in clusters differs from that in the galactic disk at a marginal confidence level of 97% . "
"interest in coordinate - free representations formulas for linear anisotropic elastic materials has been an active research area , starting by the formulation of elastic energy functionals in the framework of finite strains  @xcite and having a key role in the classification of linear elastic or piezoelectric materials  @xcite .
it has also been of main importance in the continuum mechanics representation of cracked / damaged media @xcite .
one underlying difficulty is that several elasticity tensors may represent the same linear anisotropic elastic material in different orientations .
more precisely , any change of orientation of a material specified by some rotation @xmath0 defines a new elasticity tensor @xmath1 deduced from the previous one by some _ group action _
@xmath2 where einstein convention on repeated indices is used . as the material is rotated the tensor @xmath3 moves on its _ orbit _ in the space @xmath4 of elasticity tensors .
thus , a linear elastic material is represented by the _ orbit _ of an elasticity tensor under this group action , and any intrinsic parameter is necessary an _ invariant _ of this group action .    in a seminal paper , boehler  kirilov  onat
@xcite emphasized the fundamental role played by polynomial _
invariants _ of the elasticity tensor and which have been used by auffray  kolev 
petitot  @xcite to classify the orbits of the elasticity tensor .
the old problem of finding a basis of polynomial invariants for the fourth order elasticity tensor was finally solved by olive in 2014  @xcite after several attempts  @xcite .
a _ minimal integrity basis of @xmath5 invariants _ for this space was definitively obtained in  @xcite .
note that in 2d , this integrity basis is composed by only @xmath6 invariants  @xcite , which shows the incredible complexity of 3d linear elasticity compared to 2d case . in 3d
, the problem can not be reduced as finding an integrity basis of second - order tensor - valued functions .
two main tools have been used to solve this extremely difficult computational problem .
the first one is the so - called _ harmonic decomposition _ which corresponds to the splitting of the elasticity tensor into _ irreducible pieces _
@xcite which was first achieved by backus in 1970  @xcite .
such a decomposition is useful to compute the _ material symmetry classes _  @xcite .
as mentioned , it has been used also in the study of effective elastic properties of cracked media  @xcite and  without explicit reference to it  in the homogenization techniques of laminated composites @xcite . note that in the later case , the polar decomposition method for 2d media has been used @xcite , while its equivalence with 2d harmonic decomposition has been shown in  @xcite .
the second one is a purely mathematical tool , _ binary forms _ , which was the cornerstone of invariant theory in the nineteenth century  @xcite and is connected to spinors .
this tool has been brought first to the knowledge of the mechanical community by backus  @xcite , and then by boehler  kirilov 
onat  @xcite but its deep power did not seem to have been widely considered so far .
it happens to be extremely useful for solving problems in tensor analysis for higher order tensors in 3d .
for instance , this tool was used by auffray  olive  @xcite to produce a minimal integrity basis for a traceless and totally symmetric third order tensor , which appears in piezoelectricity  @xcite and second - gradient strain elasticity theory  @xcite .
note , furthermore , that applications of binary forms are not just bounded to questions in continuum mechanics but are also related to other fields such as quantum computation  @xcite and cryptography  @xcite .
the harmonic decomposition of the elasticity tensor produces a quintuple @xmath7 where @xmath8 are scalar invariants , @xmath9 are second order traceless tensors and @xmath10 is a _
fourth order harmonic tensor_. the scalar and second order tensor components are linearly related to the voigt and the dilatation tensors , the two independent traces of the elasticity tensor .
the irreducible fourth order component remains problematic in the study the elasticity tensor .
in the present work , we try to go further in the representation of the harmonic fourth order component @xmath10 .
we propose to introduce a secondary decomposition of this tensor , which was first discovered by sylvester  @xcite and now known as _ maxwell multipoles _ ( see also  @xcite ) , through a binary operation called _ harmonic product _ ( a commutative and associative product directly inherited from the product of binary forms ) .
this decomposition aims ideally to reduce @xmath10 to a family of vectors , the maxwell multipoles , or , as detailed next , to reduce @xmath10 to a family of second order tensors .
in 2d , the factorization of the harmonic component @xmath10 by means of second order tensors was already established in  @xcite , it results from the decomposition of elasticity tensor by verchery s polar method @xcite . besides , this factorization has the good taste to be _ equivariant _ , which means that it commutes with the action of the rotation group .
however , the solution in 3d of such a decomposition  _ i.e. _ the four maxwell multipoles or in an equivalent manner the two second order tensors that factorize @xmath10  is far from being unique and constructive and is thus of poor value in practice .
moreover , there are no global _ equivariant section _ of such mappings .
we concentrate therefore on producing an _ equivariant explicit solution _ of the problem that we call a _ reconstruction _ and which are limited to specific symmetry classes .
this process uses the concept of _ covariants _ , which generalizes the idea of invariants but which are tensors ( rather than scalars ) depending in an equivariant manner of the original tensor . for obvious reasons ,
no such reconstruction can be globally defined .
as it is well known @xcite , only triclinic , monoclinic , orthotropic , transversely isotropic and isotropic classes have a chance to be reconstructed using second - order covariants .    in this paper
, we obtain for the first time explicit reconstruction formulas in the orthotropic and the transversely isotropic cases , using _ polynomial _
second - order harmonic covariants and rational invariants .
moreover , to overpass the geometrical constraints in the trigonal and in the tetragonal cases , we establish for these symmetry classes reconstruction formulas by means of second order covariants up to a single _ cubic fourth order covariant remainder_.    the considered reconstruction problem is closely related to the so - called _ isotropic extension _ of anisotropic constitutive functions via structural tensors developed by boehler  @xcite and liu  @xcite independently ( see also  @xcite ) . in the case of a _ linear constitutive law _ , an isotropic extension is just an _ equivariant reconstruction _ _ limited to a given symmetry class _ of the constitutive tensor .
furthermore , our approach is more constructive since we are able to give _ explicit equivariant formulas _ in which the `` structural tensors '' are polynomial covariant tensors of the constitutive tensor .      in section
[ sec : tensorial - representations ] , we recall basic materials on tensorial representations of the orthogonal group , recalling the link between totally symmetric tensor and homogeneous polynomials and the harmonic decomposition . in section  [ sec : harmonic - factorization ] , we introduce the _ harmonic product _ between harmonic polynomials and formulate an harmonic factorisation theorem which proof is postponed in appendix  [ sec : annexe_sylvester - theorem - proof ] . the general reconstruction problem is formulated in section  [ sec : reconstruction ] , where a geometric obstruction for an equivariant reconstruction of fourth - order tensors , by means of second order polynomial covariants is explained .
explicit reconstructions formulas , using rational invariants and second order polynomial covariants are obtained in section  [ sec : second - order - covariants ] for transversely isotropic and orthotropic tensors . in section  [ sec : other - results ] , we propose similarly equivariant reconstructions for tetragonal and trigonal fourth order harmonic tensors up to a cubic covariant remainder .      the following spaces are involved :    * @xmath4 : the space of _ elasticity tensors _ ; * @xmath11 : the space of @xmath12-th order tensors on @xmath13 ; * @xmath14 : the space of @xmath12-th order _ totally symmetric tensors _ on @xmath13 ; * @xmath15 : the space of @xmath12-th order _ harmonic tensors _ on @xmath13 ; * @xmath16 : the space of homogeneous polynomials of degree @xmath12 on @xmath13 ; * @xmath17 : the space of _ harmonic polynomials _ of degree @xmath12 on @xmath13 ; * @xmath18 : the space of binary forms of degree @xmath12 on @xmath19 ; * @xmath20 : the space of binary forms of degree @xmath21 which correspond to real harmonic tensors of degree @xmath12 .    in addition
, we adopt the following conventions :    * @xmath22 : coordinates on @xmath13 ; * @xmath23 : coordinates on @xmath19 ; * @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 : vectors of @xmath13 ; * @xmath29 : a vector in @xmath19 ; * @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 : second - order tensors ; * @xmath35 : second - order dilatation tensor ; * @xmath36 : second - order voigt tensor ; * @xmath37 : second order unit tensor ; * @xmath3 : elasticity tensor ; * @xmath38 : fourth - order unit tensor ; * @xmath39 , @xmath40 : generic tensors ; * @xmath10 : fourth - order harmonic tensor ; * @xmath41 : polynomial on @xmath13 ; * @xmath42 : harmonic polynomial on @xmath13 ; * @xmath43 : binary forms ; * @xmath44 : element of @xmath45 ; * @xmath46 : the scalar product ; * @xmath47 : the tensor product ; * @xmath48 , @xmath49 : the symmetric tensor product ; * @xmath50 : the harmonic product ; * @xmath51 : the action ; * @xmath52 : the euclidean norm ; * @xmath53 : the transpose ; * @xmath54 : the deviatoric part ; * @xmath55 : the harmonic projection ; * @xmath56 : the complex conjugate .
in this section , we recall classical facts about tensorial representations of the rotation group @xmath45 .
more details on the subject can be found in  @xcite or  @xcite .
we consider thus tensors on the euclidean space @xmath13 and , thanks to the euclidean product , we do not have to distinguish between _ upper _ and _ lower _ indices .
therefore , a @xmath12-th order tensor may always be considered as a @xmath12-linear mapping @xmath57 let @xmath11 be the space of @xmath12-th order tensors .
the rotation group @xmath45 acts on @xmath11 , by the rule @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 .
usually , we are not interested in the whole tensor space @xmath11 but rather in a subspace @xmath61 defined by some particular _ index symmetries _ and _ stable _ ( or invariant ) under the action of the rotation group @xmath45 , which means that @xmath62    [ ex : symmetric - tensors ] the permutation group @xmath63 acts on @xmath11 by the rule @xmath64 and this action commutes with the action of @xmath45 .
the space of _ totally symmetric tensors _ of order @xmath12 , denoted by @xmath14 , is the space of tensors @xmath39 which are invariant under this action , in other words , such that @xmath65    [ ex : antisymmetric - tensors ] the space of _ alternate tensors _ of order @xmath12 , denoted by @xmath66 , is the space of tensors @xmath39 such that @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the signature of the permutation @xmath69 .
the representation @xmath61 is _ irreducible _ if the only stable subspaces are @xmath70 and @xmath61 .
the irreducible representations of the rotation group @xmath45 are known ( up to isomorphism )  @xcite .
explicit models for these irreducible representations are given by _
harmonic tensor spaces _ which are described below .
contracting two indices @xmath71 on a totally symmetric tensor @xmath39 does not depend on the particular choice of the pair @xmath71 .
thus , we can refer to this contraction without any reference to a particular choice of indices .
we will denote this contraction as @xmath72 , which is a totally symmetric tensor of order @xmath73 and is called the _ trace _ of @xmath39 .
iterating the process leads to @xmath74 which is a totally symmetric tensor of order @xmath75 .
a _ harmonic tensor _ of order @xmath12 is a totally symmetric tensor @xmath76 such that @xmath77 .
the space of harmonic tensors of order @xmath12 will be denoted by @xmath15 .
it is a sub - vector space of @xmath14 of dimension @xmath78 .
the sub - space @xmath15 of @xmath14 is invariant under the action of @xmath45 and is irreducible ( see for instance  @xcite ) .
moreover , every finite dimensional irreducible representation of @xmath45 is isomorphic to some @xmath15 . as a special case of the peter 
weil theorem  @xcite , every @xmath45-representation @xmath61 splits into a direct sum of _ harmonic tensor spaces _ @xmath15 , and such a direct sum is called the _ harmonic decomposition _ of @xmath61 .
the harmonic decomposition of a second order symmetric tensor @xmath79 corresponds to its decomposition @xmath80 into its deviatoric and spheric parts @xmath81    there is a well - known correspondence between totally symmetric tensors of order @xmath12 and homogeneous polynomial of degree @xmath12 on @xmath13 , which extends the well - known correspondence between a symmetric bilinear form and a quadratic form via polarization .
indeed , to each symmetric tensor @xmath76 corresponds a homogeneous polynomial of degree @xmath12 given by @xmath82    this correspondence defines a linear isomorphism @xmath83 between the tensor space @xmath14 and the polynomial space @xmath16 of homogeneous polynomials of degree @xmath12 on @xmath13 .
the linear isomorphism @xmath83 satisfies moreover @xmath84 it is said to be an _ equivariant _ mapping .
the rotation group @xmath45 acts on the polynomial space @xmath16 , by the rule @xmath85    the inverse @xmath86 can be recovered by _
precisely , the expression @xmath87 is a homogeneous polynomial in the variables @xmath88 and we get @xmath89    note that the _ laplacian operator _ of @xmath90 writes as @xmath91 thus , _ totally symmetric tensors with vanishing trace _ correspond _ via _ @xmath83 to _ harmonic polynomials _ ( polynomials with vanishing laplacian ) .
this justifies the denomination of _ harmonic tensors _ for elements of @xmath15 .
more generally , for any non - negative integer @xmath92 , we get @xmath93    the equivariant isomorphism @xmath83 sends @xmath15 to @xmath17 , the space of homogeneous harmonic polynomials of degree @xmath12 .
thus , the spaces @xmath17 provide alternative models for _ irreducible representations _ of the rotation group @xmath45 . a third model of these irreducible representations
is given by the spaces of _ binary forms _ @xmath20 , whose construction is detailed in appendix  [ sec : annexe_binary - forms ] .
the harmonic decomposition of a homogeneous polynomial of degree @xmath12 is described by the following proposition .
[ prop : symmetric - harmonic - decomposition ] every homogeneous polynomial @xmath94 can be decomposed uniquely as @xmath95 where @xmath96 , @xmath97 $ ]  with @xmath98 $ ] integer part  and @xmath99 is a harmonic polynomial of degree @xmath75 .
the harmonic polynomial @xmath100 is the orthogonal projection of @xmath41 onto @xmath17 ( for the induced euclidean structure of @xmath13 ) .
its explicit expression can be obtained recursively as follows ( see  @xcite ) .
let first define @xmath101 then @xmath99 is obtained inductively by the formula @xmath102 with @xmath103 which leads to @xmath104 after @xmath105 iterations .    introducing the symmetric tensor product @xmath106 for @xmath107 and @xmath108 , we can recast proposition  [ prop : symmetric - harmonic - decomposition ] in tensorial form : @xmath109 where @xmath97 $ ] .
more precisely , every totally symmetric tensor @xmath76 of order @xmath12 can be decomposed uniquely as @xmath110 where @xmath111 is a harmonic tensor of degree @xmath75 and @xmath112 means the symmetrized tensorial product of @xmath92 copies of @xmath113 .
the harmonic part @xmath114 is the orthogonal projection of @xmath39 onto @xmath15 . using
, the tensorial form of   reads @xmath115 which is a scalar for even @xmath12 or a vector for odd @xmath12 .
finally , the tensorial form of   is given by : @xmath116\ ] ] note that in this equation , @xmath117 $ ] is the orthogonal projection of @xmath118 on @xmath119 .
harmonic decomposition of the space @xmath4 of elasticity tensors was first obtained by backus  @xcite and is given by @xmath120    more precisely , an elasticity tensor @xmath3 admits the following harmonic decomposition  @xcite : @xmath121 in this formula , @xmath113 is the euclidean canonical bilinear 2-form represented by the components @xmath122 in any orthonormal basis and the young - symmetrized tensor products @xmath49 and @xmath123 , between symmetric second - order tensors @xmath124 , are defined as follows : @xmath125 where @xmath49 is the totally symmetric tensor product also denoted by @xmath48 , and @xmath126 in the harmonic decomposition  , @xmath127 are scalars , @xmath128 are second order harmonic tensors ( also known as symmetric deviatoric tensors ) and @xmath10 is a fourth - order harmonic tensor .    in this decomposition , @xmath127 and @xmath128 are related to the _ dilatation tensor _ @xmath129 and the _ voigt tensor _ @xmath130 by the formulas @xmath131 and @xmath132 where @xmath133 and @xmath134 are the deviatoric parts of @xmath135 and @xmath136 respectively .
in this section , we introduce a product between harmonic tensors ( which is associative and commutative ) .
then , we show that every harmonic tensor @xmath137 can be factorized as a harmonic product of lower order tensors .
the product of two harmonic polynomials is not harmonic in general .
however , we define the following binary operation on the space of harmonic polynomials : @xmath138 this product is commutative : @xmath139 and is moreover associative , which means that @xmath140 the fact that this binary operation is associative is essential in practice .
it means that the final result does not depend on the way we have chosen to  put the brackets ' to compute it .
we can therefore write @xmath141 and omit the brackets .
endowed with this product , the vector space @xmath142 of harmonic polynomials becomes a _
commutative algebra_. the unity ( for the multiplicative operation @xmath50 ) is represented by the constant harmonic polynomial @xmath143 .
[ rem : h1odoth2 ] using the equivariant isomorphism @xmath83 between @xmath15 and @xmath17 , this algebraic structure is inherited on harmonic tensors .
more precisely , given two harmonic tensors @xmath144 and @xmath145 of order @xmath146 and @xmath147 respectively , we define a harmonic tensor @xmath148 of order @xmath149 by the following formula : @xmath150    [ ex : v - ast - w ] for two vectors @xmath151 , we get @xmath152    [ ex : a - ast - b ] for two second order harmonic tensors @xmath153 , we get @xmath154      we now introduce the following @xmath45-equivariant mapping , from the direct sum @xmath155 of @xmath12 copies of @xmath13 to @xmath17 : @xmath156 this mapping is obviously not _ one - to - one_. it is however _ surjective_. this result is not trivial and seems to have been demonstrated for the first time by sylvester  @xcite ( see also  ( * ? ? ?
* appendix 1 ) ) .
we provide our own proof of sylvester s theorem in appendix  [ sec : annexe_sylvester - theorem - proof ] , which relies on _ binary forms_. note however , that the use of binary forms for the proofs limits the validity of these theorems to dimension @xmath157 ( see @xcite for a counter - example in dimension @xmath158 ) .    [

the four roots of @xmath164 are @xmath165 with the possible couple @xmath166 among them . using the stereographic projection @xmath167 ( see remark  [ ex : order1-harmonic - tensors ] ) , we set @xmath168 note that @xmath169 then , we have @xmath170 for some constant @xmath171 .    the lack of injectivity for the mapping @xmath172 is detailed in the following proposition , which proof is provided in appendix  [ sec : annexe_sylvester - theorem - proof ] .    [ prop : fiber ] we have @xmath173 if and only if @xmath174 where @xmath175 is a permutation of the vectors @xmath176 for some @xmath177 and @xmath178 are real numbers such that @xmath179 .
it is tempting to restrict the mapping @xmath172 defined in   to unit vectors , in order to try to reduce the indeterminacy in the choice of an @xmath12-uple of vectors @xmath176 .
however , this does not really solve the problem of indeterminacy .
of course , the indeterminacy due to the scaling by the @xmath180 is replaced by signs @xmath181 , but the indeterminacy due to the permutation persists anyway .
sylvester s theorem is equivalent to the following ( in appearance , more general ) theorem which leads to other important factorization results for harmonic polynomials ( and thus harmonic tensors ) .
[ thm : harmonic - factorization - theorem ] let @xmath182 .
then there exist harmonic polynomials @xmath183 such that @xmath184    [ rem : tensorial - hkn ] the tensorial counterpart of theorem [ thm : harmonic - factorization - theorem ] is that for every harmonic tensor @xmath185 there exist harmonic tensors @xmath186 such that @xmath187    a corollary of theorem  [ thm : harmonic - factorization - theorem ] is the following result , which applies to every even order harmonic tensor .
[ cor : diffcarre_tensor ] let @xmath188 .
then there exist @xmath189 such that @xmath190    let @xmath191 corresponding to the harmonic tensor @xmath192 . using theorem  [ thm : harmonic - factorization - theorem ] , we can find @xmath193 such that @xmath194 . but
@xmath195 hence , if we set @xmath196 and @xmath197 , we get @xmath198 which tensorial form is precisely  .
this result has already been obtained in  @xcite for monoclinic harmonic fourth - order tensors , using direct elimination techniques .    in 2d ,
the factorization of the harmonic part @xmath199 of the elasticity tensor has already been computed in @xcite , using previous results obtained in  @xcite . in that case , we get @xmath200 with second order tensor @xmath33 harmonic ( _ i.e. _ symmetric deviatoric ) , and where @xmath201 and @xmath202 . as in 3d , we can define a harmonic product between 2d harmonic tensors @xmath203 @xmath204 and equation   can be rewritten as @xmath205 hence , any 2d harmonic fourth - order tensor can be expressed as the harmonic square @xmath206 , _
i.e. _ the projection of diadic symmetric square @xmath207 onto the vector space of fourth - order harmonic tensors @xmath208 . in 3d , this result is generally false . indeed , if a fourth - order harmonic tensor @xmath10 is a harmonic square , _
i.e. _ @xmath209 , then @xmath10 is either orthotropic or transversely isotropic ( see section  [ sec : reconstruction ] ) .
although these various decompositions are interesting by themselves , there is however something frustrating .
these decompositions are not unique in general and the solution is not enough constructive ( they require root s extraction of possible high degree polynomials ) . in the next sections , we provide explicit geometric reconstructions .
in this section , we consider the general problem of reconstructing a fourth - order harmonic tensor @xmath10 using lower order _ covariants _ ( i.e. lower order tensors which depend on @xmath10 in an equivariant manner ) .
this reconstruction is useful when applied to the fourth - order harmonic part @xmath10 of the elasticity tensor ( [ eq : harme ] ) , since its other components @xmath210 are already decomposed by means of second order covariants tensors and invariants .    from a mechanical point of view the definition of covariants of a given  effective
tensor is strongly related to the tensorial nature of the thermodynamics variables allowing to properly model a specific state coupling with elasticity  @xcite . in the case of
effective elasticity of cracked / damaged media for instance , either second order @xcite or fourth order @xcite damage variables are considered , depending on the authors choice @xcite . considering
the reconstruction by means of lower order covariants of the harmonic part of an effective elasticity tensor in this case would answer the question : do we have to use a fourth order damage variable  a fourth order covariant in next derivations  in order to reconstruct a given harmonic 
effective elasticity 
tensor ? in 2d
the answer is negative , as shown in @xcite : only one second order tensor @xmath33 is needed ( see eq .  ) .      to illustrate the problem ,
let us first come back to theorem  [ thm : harmonic - factorization - theorem ]
. applied to a fourth - order harmonic tensor @xmath10 , this theorem states that @xmath10 can be factorized as the harmonic product of two second order harmonic tensors @xmath211 in other words , the equivariant mapping @xmath212 is surjective .
what would be more interesting is to have an explicit mapping ( i.e. an explicit construction of the solution ) @xmath213 such that : @xmath214 and with geometric properties .
a mapping like @xmath215 is called a _ section _ of @xmath216
. a geometric property would be for instance for @xmath215 to be equivariant , in which case each second order tensors @xmath217 is a covariant tensor .
the main problem is that there does not exist any _ equivariant section _
@xmath215 for @xmath216 defined on the whole space @xmath218 : for instance , for a tensor @xmath10 with cubic symmetry , all second order harmonic covariants vanish , which forbids the existence of such a general equivariant section .
we will provide now the following definitions .
let @xmath39 be some @xmath12th order tensor .
a _ decomposition _ of a @xmath39 into other _ tensors _ ( possibly scalars ) @xmath219 ( @xmath220 ) is a mapping @xmath221 the decomposition is _ equivariant _ if @xmath216 is an equivariant mapping .    given a decomposition @xmath222 of a tensor @xmath39 into other _
tensors _ ( possibly scalars ) , a _ reconstruction _ of @xmath39 is a section @xmath215 of @xmath216 .
the reconstruction is _ equivariant _ if both @xmath216 and @xmath215 are equivariant mappings .    in other words ,
a reconstruction is given by a mapping @xmath223 such that @xmath224 if the reconstruction is equivariant the @xmath225 are _ covariant tensors _ ( or invariants if there are scalars ) , which means that @xmath226      the existence of an equivariant reconstruction may not be possible for certain symmetry classes . more precisely , we have the following result .    [
lem : obstruction - equivariant - reconstruction ] consider an equivariant decomposition @xmath227 and suppose that there exists an equivariant reconstruction @xmath215 , so that @xmath228 are covariants tensors .
then @xmath229 where @xmath230 is the _ symmetry group _ of the tensor @xmath39 .
consider an equivariant decomposition @xmath227 .
then , we have @xmath231 if moreover @xmath232 are covariant tensors , we get thus @xmath233 for all @xmath234 , and hence @xmath235 , which achieves the proof .    according to lemma  [ lem : obstruction - equivariant - reconstruction ] ,
the existence of an equivariant reconstruction associated to an equivariant decomposition @xmath236 requires some conditions on the symmetry groups of the involved covariants @xmath232 . for a decomposition involving second - order covariant tensors
, we have the following result ( for details on closed subgroups of @xmath45 , see appendix  [ sec : symmetry - classes ] ) .    [ cor : second - order - obstruction ] if @xmath227 is an equivariant decomposition of @xmath39 into _ second - order symmetric covariant tensors _
@xmath228 , then @xmath237\in { \left\{[{\mathds{1}}],[{\mathbb{z}}_{2}],[{\mathbb{d}}_{2}],[{\mathrm{o}}(2)]\right\}},\ ] ] where @xmath238 $ ] means the conjugacy class of a subgroup @xmath239 .
the proof is easily achieved using the _ clips operator _ introduced in  @xcite .
this binary operator , noted @xmath240 is defined on conjugacy classes ( or finite families of conjugacy classes ) of closed subgroups of @xmath45 : @xmath241\circledcirc [ h_{2}]={\left\ { [ h_{1}\cap ( gh_{2}g^{-1})],\quad g\in { \mathrm{so}}(3,{\mathbb{r}})\right\}}.\ ] ] it is an associative and commutative operation and @xmath242 \circledcirc [ { \mathds{1 } } ] = { \left\{[{\mathds{1}}]\right\ } } , \qquad [ h ] \circledcirc [ { \mathrm{so}}(3,{\mathbb{r } } ) ] = { \left\{[h]\right\}},\ ] ] for all closed subgroup @xmath243 .
moreover , we have in particular ( see  @xcite ) :    [ cols='^,^,^,^',options='header ' , ]     thus , if each @xmath228 is a second - order symmetric covariant ( or an invariant ) , then @xmath244 $ ] is either @xmath245 $ ] , @xmath246 $ ] or @xmath247 $ ] ( see  ) and we deduce that @xmath237\in [ h_{1}]\circledcirc [ h_{2 } ] \dotsc \circledcirc [ h_{n}],\quad [ h_{i}]\in { \left\{[{\mathbb{d}}_{2}],[{\mathrm{o}}(2)],[{\mathrm{so}}(3,{\mathbb{r}})]\right\}},\ ] ] which achieves the proof .
corrollary  [ cor : second - order - obstruction ] implies in particular that there is no equivariant reconstruction by means of second order symmetric covariant tensors of a harmonic fourth order tensor @xmath10 ( and thus of the elasticity tensor @xmath3 ) for the cubic , the trigonal and the tetragonal symmetry classes . for a cubic tensor , the situation is even worse since all its second order symmetric covariants are spheric , whereas its first order covariants vanish .
the geometric framework introduced here is connected to the so - called _ isotropic extension _ of anisotropic constitutive functions via structural tensors developed by boehler  @xcite and liu  @xcite independently ( see also  @xcite ) . in the case of a linear constitutive function ,
an isotropic extension is just an equivariant decomposition _ limited to a given symmetry class _ @xmath248 $ ] and for which the arguments @xmath249 ( the structural tensors ) of the decomposition satisfy  . in that case , our approach is however more constructive since we are able to give an _ explicit equivariant formula _ in which the `` structural tensors '' are covariant tensors of the constitutive tensor .
moreover , condition   is a corollary of the theory and does not need to be imposed _ a priori _ as an hypothesis .
in this section , we provide explicit equivariant reconstructions for transverse - isotropic and orthotropic fourth order harmonic tensors .
these reconstructions use the following second - order ( polynomial ) covariants introduced in  @xcite : @xmath250 where the following notations have been used .    * for two fourth - order tensors @xmath251 and @xmath252 , @xmath253 is the fourth - order tensor @xmath254 * for a fourth - order tensor @xmath251 and a second - order tensor @xmath255 , @xmath256 is the second - order tensor @xmath257    we also make use of the following invariants : @xmath258 which constitute an _ integrity basis _ for @xmath218 ( see  @xcite ) .
the second  order covariants @xmath259 ( @xmath260 ) are always _ symmetric _ covariants , while in general @xmath259 ( @xmath261 ) are neither symmetric nor antisymmetric .
finally , using the kelvin representation , a fourth order harmonic tensor @xmath262 is represented by the symmetric matrix @xmath263 with only 9 independent components due to the traceless property , namely : @xmath264      a harmonic tensor @xmath265 is transverse isotropic if and only if there exists @xmath0 such that @xmath266 where @xmath267 has the following normal matrix form @xmath268 where @xmath269 .
it was moreover established in  ( * ? ? ?
* section 5.2 ) that @xmath270 thus , by a direct computation of the second order covariant @xmath271 ( see eq .  ) and its deviatoric part @xmath272 , we get the following result :    [ thm : o2 ] for any transversely isotropic harmonic fourth - order tensor @xmath10 , we have @xmath273    [ rem : o2-harmonic - square ] if @xmath274 , then @xmath10 is a perfect harmonic square .
the converse is also true and can be easily established , using binary forms , where the harmonic product corresponds to the ordinary product of polynomials .
a harmonic tensor @xmath265 is orthotropic if and only if there exists @xmath0 such that @xmath266 where @xmath267 has the following normal matrix form @xmath275 where @xmath276 are three _ distinct _ real numbers . note that this normal form is however not unique : any permutation of the @xmath277 provides an alternative normal form , but this is the only ambiguity .
it is therefore useful to introduce the three elementary symmetric functions @xmath278 which are independent of a particular normal form , as being invariant under any permutation of the @xmath279 .
moreover , it was shown in  ( * ? ? ?
* section 5.5 ) that the _ discriminant _ @xmath280 which is _ strictly positive _ , is a polynomial invariant , and that the @xmath281 are themselves _
rational invariants_. more precisely : @xmath282 and @xmath283    consider now the matrix @xmath284    since both @xmath267 and @xmath285 have the same symmetry group , namely @xmath286 ( as defined in ) , the following definition @xmath287 does not depend on the rotation @xmath44 and thus defines a covariant mapping from the orthotopic class in @xmath218 to the space of symmetric second order tensors .
we have moreover the following result , which can be checked by a direct evaluation on @xmath267 and @xmath288 .
[ lem : rational - expression - lambda ] let @xmath10 be an orthotropic harmonic fourth - order tensor .
then , the deviatoric part @xmath289 of the second order covariant @xmath290 can be written as @xmath291 where @xmath292    note that @xmath293 and we can thus introduce the positive invariant @xmath294 and the _ lode invariant _ defined by @xmath295 since moreover @xmath296 and @xmath297 , we deduce that @xmath298 .    with these notations ,
we obtain the following result which can be checked by a direct computation on the normal form .
[ thm : d2 ] for any orthotropic harmonic fourth - order tensor @xmath10 , we have @xmath299 where @xmath289 is defined by   and the three invariants @xmath300 are given by @xmath301    the three invariants @xmath300 are in fact rational invariants of @xmath10 . using invariants @xmath281 ( eq . ( [ eq : sym - func ] ) ) , we have indeed @xmath302    as in the transversely orthotropic case , the following theorem characterized orthotropic harmonic tensors which are a perfect harmonic squares .
[ thm : orth_square ] an orthotropic harmonic fourth - order tensor @xmath10 is a perfect harmonic square @xmath303 if and only if @xmath304 in that case the harmonic second order tensor @xmath33 is is given by @xmath305    let @xmath10 be an orthotropic fourth order harmonic tensor .
suppose first that conditions   are satisfied .
then , the coefficients @xmath306 , @xmath307 , @xmath308 in   satisfy @xmath309 and we have thus a factorization @xmath303 , where @xmath33 is defined by  .
conversely , suppose that @xmath10 can be factorized as @xmath303 .
without loss of generality , we can assume that @xmath33 is diagonal , with diagonal elements @xmath310 , @xmath311 and @xmath312 .
thus @xmath10 is fixed by @xmath286 and is represented by matrix normal form  .
consider now the associated binary form @xmath313 of @xmath33 ( resp .
@xmath164 of @xmath10 )  see .
we get then @xmath314 and @xmath315 now , @xmath316 leads to @xmath317 and we get @xmath318 therefore , we have @xmath319 if @xmath320 , we get also @xmath321 and thus @xmath322 , which leads to a contradiction ( since @xmath10 is supposed to be orthotropic ) .
this concludes the proof .
in this section , we consider the problem of reconstruction of harmonic tensors for which an equivariant reconstruction into second - order tensors is not possible , namely the harmonic tensors within the trigonal and the tetragonal classes .
for these two classes , we show that such a reconstruction is possible up to a _ fourth - order harmonic tensor with cubic symmetry_. all the closed @xmath45 subgroups used in this section are defined in .
a harmonic tensor @xmath265 is tetragonal if and only if there exists @xmath0 such that @xmath266 where @xmath267 has the following normal matrix form @xmath323 where @xmath324 and @xmath325 .
note that this normal form is however not unique : the change @xmath326 , provides an alternative normal form .
nevertheless , the choice @xmath327 allows to fix this ambiguity .
note also that @xmath328 where @xmath329 is the rotation by angle @xmath330 around the @xmath331 axis .
for tetragonal harmonic tensors , it was shown in  ( * ? ? ?
* section 5.4 ) that the following polynomial invariants do not vanish @xmath332 and that @xmath333 and @xmath334 are rational invariants , given by @xmath335 the choice @xmath327 in the normal form   allows to write @xmath69 as follows : @xmath336    note that the condition @xmath337 is equivalent to @xmath338 with @xmath339 and corresponds to the degeneracy when @xmath10 has at least a cubic symmetry . on the other hand , the condition @xmath340 ( with @xmath341 )
is equivalent to @xmath342 and corresponds to the degeneracy when @xmath10 has at least a transverse isotropic symmetry .
the normal form   corresponds to the subspace @xmath343 , where given a subgroup @xmath344 of @xmath345 the _ fixed point set _ @xmath346 is defined as @xmath347 note now that there is only one subgroup in the conjugacy class @xmath246 $ ] which contains @xmath348 , it is @xmath349 itself .
its fix point set , @xmath350 , is the one - dimensional subspace spanned by @xmath351 however , there are two different subgroups @xmath352 and @xmath353 in the conjugacy class @xmath354 $ ] which contains @xmath348 and which are defined as follows . the first one , @xmath352 , is the symmetry group of the cube with edges @xmath355 .
the second one , @xmath353 , is obtained by rotating @xmath352 around the @xmath331 axis by angle @xmath330 . in other words , @xmath356 , where @xmath105 is the rotation by angle @xmath330 around the @xmath331 axis .
the fixed point sets @xmath357 and @xmath358 are one - dimensional subspaces spanned respectively by @xmath359 and @xmath360 moreover , both @xmath357 and @xmath358 are supplementary subspaces of @xmath350 in @xmath343 , and thus we can write either @xmath361 or @xmath362    let @xmath10 be a tetragonal harmonic fourth order tensor
. then there exists @xmath60 ( defined up to a right composition by an element of @xmath348 ) and a unique couple of real numbers @xmath363 with @xmath364 such that : @xmath365 since @xmath366 , the following definitions @xmath367 do not depend on the rotation @xmath44 , leading to well - defined covariant mappings @xmath368 , @xmath369 from the tetragonal class in @xmath218 to the transversely isotropic classes .
similarly , since @xmath352 and @xmath353 contains @xmath348 , the same is true for @xmath370    let @xmath329 be the rotation by angle @xmath330 around the @xmath331 axis .
we have then @xmath371 now if @xmath372 , we get @xmath373      [ thm : d4 ] for any tetragonal harmonic fourth - order tensor @xmath10 , we have @xmath374 where @xmath375 is a transversely isotropic covariant , and @xmath376 is a cubic covariant .
all the formulas can be checked on the normal form  , for which @xmath377 . since
the formulas are covariant , this is enough to achieve the proof .
in theorem [ thm : d4 ] , each formula , i.e. @xmath378 or @xmath379 , is self - sufficient .
it is equivariant and applies in any basis to any tetragonal harmonic fourth order tensor @xmath10 .
the two reconstruction formulas correspond to the choice of a frame and therefore of a cube , rotated by the angle @xmath330 or not around @xmath331 .
they use the invariants @xmath327 and @xmath333 defined in and .
the decomposition in theorem  [ thm : d4 ] can be rewritten in terms of the invariants @xmath380 , @xmath381 , @xmath382 and @xmath383 , rather than @xmath384 by using their rational expressions   and  .
[ cor : d4 ] for any tetragonal harmonic fourth - order tensor @xmath10 , we have @xmath385 where @xmath386 is a cubic fourth order covariant and @xmath387      a harmonic tensor @xmath265 is trigonal if and only if there exists @xmath0 such that @xmath266 where @xmath267 has the following normal matrix form @xmath388 where @xmath389 and @xmath325 .
note that this normal form is however not unique .
changing @xmath390 , provides an alternative normal form .
nevertheless , the choice @xmath327 allows to fix this ambiguity .
note also that @xmath391 where @xmath392 is the rotation by angle @xmath393 around the @xmath331 axis .    for trigonal harmonic tensors
, it was shown in  ( * ? ? ?
* section 5.3 ) that the polynomial invariants @xmath381 and @xmath382 , defined by , are strictly positive and that @xmath333 , @xmath334 are rational invariants , given by @xmath394    the choice @xmath327 in the normal form   allows to write @xmath69 as follows : @xmath395    note that the condition @xmath396 is equivalent to @xmath397 with @xmath398 and corresponds to the degeneracy case when @xmath10 has at least a cubic symmetry . on the other hand , with @xmath399,condition @xmath340 is equivalent to @xmath342 and corresponds to the degeneracy case when @xmath10 has at least a transverse isotropic symmetry .      the geometric picture is similar to the tetragonal case : @xmath400 is contained in only one subgroup in the conjugacy class @xmath246 $ ] and two different subgroups @xmath401 , @xmath402 in the conjugacy class @xmath354 $ ] , which are defined as follows .
@xmath403 where @xmath352 is the symmetry group of the cube with edges @xmath355 ( already defined in section  [ subsec : tetragonal ] ) and the rotations introduced are @xmath404    the fixed point sets @xmath405 and @xmath406 are one - dimensional subspaces spanned respectively by @xmath407 and @xmath408    the normal form   can be decomposed as the sum of a transversely isotropic harmonic tensor and of a cubic harmonic tensor , either as @xmath409 or as @xmath410 where @xmath411 has been defined in  .    as in the tetragonal case , we can give coherent definitions of transversely isotropic parts    @xmath412    and cubic parts @xmath413      [ thm : d3 ] for any trigonal harmonic fourth - order tensor @xmath10 , we have @xmath414 where @xmath415 is a transversely isotropic covariant and @xmath416 is a cubic covariant
.    all the formulas can be checked on the normal form  , for which @xmath417 .
since the formulas are covariant , this is enough to achieve the proof .
in theorem [ thm : d3 ] , each formula , i.e. @xmath378 or @xmath379 , is self - sufficient .
it is equivariant and applies in any basis to any trigonal harmonic fourth order tensor @xmath10 .
the two reconstruction formulas correspond to the choice of a frame and therefore of a cube , rotated by the angle @xmath393 or not around @xmath331 .
they use the invariants @xmath327 and @xmath333 defined in eq .
( [ eq : coeff - trigonal ] ) and ( [ eq : coeff - trigonal - sigma ] ) .
the decomposition in theorem  [ thm : d4 ] can be rewritten in terms of the invariants @xmath380 , @xmath381 , @xmath382 and @xmath418 , rather than @xmath384 by using their rational expressions   and  .
[ cor : d3 ] for any trigonal harmonic fourth - order tensor @xmath10 , we have @xmath419 where @xmath420 is a cubic fourth order covariant , and @xmath421
in this article , we have defined the _ harmonic projection _
@xmath422 of a totally symmetric @xmath12-th order tensor @xmath39 , and the _ harmonic product _ @xmath423 of two harmonic tensors
@xmath424 , @xmath425 .    using sylvester s theorem  [ thm : sylvester ] , we have shown that the fourth order harmonic part @xmath10 of an elasticity tensor @xmath3 can be expressed as the harmonic product @xmath426 of two second order harmonic tensors @xmath427 ( _ i.e. _ symmetric deviatoric ) .
this decomposition is independent of any reference frame , even for triclinic materials .
nevertheless , such a factorization is non - unique and not really constructive .
moreover , a _ globally defined _
solution @xmath428 can never be _
we have therefore introduced an _ equivariant reconstruction _
problem of a tensor by means of _ lower order covariants _ , restricted to a given symmetry class . finally , we have obtained explicit formulas for the reconstruction of the fourth order harmonic part @xmath10 of an elasticity tensor :    * for the _ transversely isotropic _ and _ orthotropic _ symmetry classes , by means of second order covariants ( theorems  [ thm : o2 ] and theorem  [ thm : d2 ] ) . moreover ,
necessary and sufficient conditions for such tensors to be perfect harmonic squares , which means @xmath303 , have also been obtained ( remark  [ rem : o2-harmonic - square ] and theorem  [ thm : orth_square ] ) ; * for the _ tetragonal _ and _ trigonal _ symmetry classes , by means of second order covariants and a fourth order cubic covariant ( theorem  [ thm : d4 ] and theorem  [ thm : d3 ] ) .
these reconstruction formulas are only valid inside each symmetry class , this is illustrated by the fact that they contain denominators which vanish when a degeneracy into a higher symmetry class occurs .
we have already described two models for the irreducible representations of the rotation group @xmath45 : the space of _ harmonic tensors _ @xmath15 and the space of harmonic polynomials @xmath17 . in this section , we shall derive a third model : the space of _ binary forms _ @xmath20 , whose construction is slightly more involved .    to start , let us recall that there is a well - known relation between the rotation group @xmath45 and the group of _ special unitary complex matrices _
@xmath429 let @xmath430 be a linear mapping from @xmath13 to the space of traceless , hermitian matrices of order @xmath431 ( @xmath432 , @xmath433 and @xmath434 are the famous _ pauli matrices _ ) .
the group @xmath435 acts on this space by conjugacy @xmath436 and preserves the quadratic form @xmath437 it can be checked , moreover , that @xmath438 for all @xmath439 .
therefore , we deduce a group morphism @xmath440    for @xmath441 we get @xmath442 in the basis @xmath443 .    the group @xmath435 acts naturally on @xmath19 and more generally on complex polynomials in two variables @xmath444 by the rule @xmath445    let @xmath18 be the space of complex , homogeneous polynomials of degree @xmath12 in two variables .
an element of @xmath18 @xmath446 is called a _ binary form _ of degree @xmath12 .
the main observation , due to cartan ( see  @xcite for the details ) , is that there is an _ equivariant isomorphism _ between the space @xmath447 of binary forms of degree @xmath21 and the space @xmath448 of complex , harmonic polynomials of degree @xmath12 in three variables @xmath449 .

"black holes are regarded as an extremely important population in modern cosmological physics .
the reionization of the universe may get started from @xmath7 deduced from _
wilkinson microwave anisotropic probe _
( _ wmap _ ) which gives thomson scattering depth @xmath8 ( spergel et al .
such an early reionization epoch needs a large population of seed black holes collapsed from population iii stars ( madau et a. 2004 ) .
second , the discovery of the currently known highest redshift quasar , sdss 1148 + 3251 at @xmath9 ( roughly 1 gyr ) from _ sloan digital sky survey _ ( sdss ; fan et al .
2001 ) indicates that there are already supermassive black holes with @xmath10 ( netzer 2003 , barth et al .
2003 , willott et al .
2003 ) . what is the relation between the seed and supermassive black holes ? how to form supermassive black holes ?
rees diagram shows several possible ways to form supermassive black holes ( rees 1984 ) .
a direct collapse of primordial clouds could form supermassive black holes after cosmic background radiation photons remove enough angular momentum through compton drag ( loeb 1993 , loeb & rassio 1994 ) .
this scenario is favored by ly@xmath11 fuzz of the extended emission in quasar where the supermassive black hole has been formed and the galaxy is assembling ( weidinger , moller & fynbo 2004 ) , especially the recent discovery of an isolated black hole of the quasar he 0450 - 2958 without a massive host galaxy ( magain et al .
second , a rapid growth of a seed black hole with highly super - eddington accretion rates is used to explain the existence of the black hole @xmath12 at high redshift .
third a compact cluster of main sequence stars , or neutron stars / black holes will inevitably evolve into a supermassive black hole ( duncan & shapiro 1983 , quinlan & shapiro 1990 ) , and this gets supports from the quasar s metallicity properties ( wang 2001 ) .
the different ways to form a supermassive black hole may apply to different redshifts or environments .
a rapid growth of seed black holes is quite a promising model to issue the formation of supermassive black holes at redshift @xmath13 ( volonteri & rees 2005 ) .
the bondi accretion rate is @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the eddington limit , for a @xmath3 black hole surrounded by medium cooled by the hydrogen atomic lines .
the seed black hole is able to grow up exponentially @xmath17 , where the salpeter timescale @xmath18gyr .
however , such a high accretion rate inevitably gives rise to strong interactions of radiation and outflows with the bondi accretion flow .
consequently , the strong feedback seriously constrains the matter supply to the black hole , even stops the accretion .    in this letter
we discuss how the feedback impacts on the growth of the seed black holes .
we find they can not grow up between redshift @xmath2 through accretion . the implications of the present results are discussed .
the very first population iii stars rapidly evolve into intermediate mass black holes ( imbhs ) , @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( fryer et al .
2001 , omukai & palla 2003 ) .
these imbhs , as shown in volonteri & rees ( 2005 ) , can rapidly grow up to supermassive black holes via bondi accretion with a super - critical rate .
the strong tidal torque due to nearby clouds efficiently offer angular momentum @xmath21 to each other ( peebles 1969 , barnes & efstathiou 1987 ) . for a rigid virialized sphere with mass @xmath22 ,
total energy @xmath23 and radius @xmath24 , its angular momentum is characterized by @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the gravitational constant ( peebles 1969 ) .
it is useful to define a dimensionless parameter , @xmath27 , for a cloud with mass @xmath22 , angular momentum @xmath21 and the total energy @xmath23 .
following oh & haiman ( 2002 ) , a cold fat disk is formed with an isothermal exponential radial distribution @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the central density and vertical scale height of the disk at radius @xmath24 , @xmath31 is the radial scale length .
the central    [ fig1 ] 0.5 cm    density is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the gas fraction settled into the isothermal disk , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the virialized radius and mass of the halo , respectively .
the disk s radius scale is @xmath38 .
the emergent spectrum from the slim disk is characterized by a universe shape of @xmath60 ( wang & zhou 1999 , wang et al .
1999 , see also shimura & manmoto 2003 , kawaguchi 2003 ) , the hard x - ray emission is highly dependent on the factor @xmath61 , which indicates how many energy is released in the hot corona ( wang & netzer 2003 , chen & wang 2004 , hereafter , socrates & davis 2005 ) .
even @xmath62 , the released energy from hot corona is close to eddington limit .
the physics related with the factor @xmath61 remains open .
the compton temperature reads @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath65 is the mean energy of photons from the disk which depend on @xmath66 .
the mean energy of the photons are in a range of @xmath67kev for @xmath68 ( wang & netzer 2003 ) .
we take the lower value @xmath69kev , so the medium will be heated up to @xmath70k at least .
it should be pointed out that the higher the compton temperature is , the stronger the feedback from the tiny accretion disk has influence on its surroundings .
the radiation pressure acting on the medium inside the bondi accretion sphere is of order @xmath71 , where the thomson scattering depth is @xmath72 and @xmath73 is thomson cross section .
we find the ratio of @xmath74 , beyond the radius @xmath75 , the radiation pressure is negligible , where @xmath76 . since the photon trapping effects , the radiated luminosity from the highly super - critical accretion disk is lower than eddington limit by a factor of 3 ( see equation 6 ) .
so radiation pressure hardly prevents the infalling matter from accretion onto the black hole .
the feedback from the radiation pressure is negligible .
the bondi flow will be heated by the radiation from the tiny accretion disk . in turn
, the heated medium determines a new bondi accretion rate switched on the tiny disk .
the thermal status of the photoionized medium can be conveniently described by the ionization parameter defined as @xmath77 ( krolik , mckee & tarter 1981 ) .
we focus on a region with @xmath78 ( for pure hydrogen gas ) , here @xmath79 , where the entire medium will be heated up to compton temperature @xmath80 .
it follows from @xmath81 which is called the compton radius ( and sphere ) .
it needs a compton timescale @xmath82 to form such a compton sphere .
however the compton sphere is also constrained by the balance of the heating and infalling timescale of the bondi flow .
it follows from @xmath83 , @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the infalling velocity of the bondi flow normalized by the sound speed and @xmath86 .
the effects of the infalling on the compton sphere can be neglected if the infalling velocity is less than @xmath87 . for @xmath88 ,
we find @xmath89 .
this means that _ not _ entire region with @xmath90 can be heated up to the compton temperature ( @xmath80 ) .
so the compton radius is given by @xmath91 , corresponding to a timescale of @xmath5yr .
we note that @xmath92 kpc .    within the compton sphere
, the seed black hole has a new bondi accretion radius @xmath93 and a bondi accretion rate , @xmath94 we note that this radius is still much larger than the tiny disk @xmath54 and this accretion rate is much smaller than that in the pre - feedbacked .
the timescale of the compton heating at @xmath95 is @xmath96yr .
that is to say the beginning bondi accretion will be halted suddenly .
after the termination of the super - critical accretion , the hot plasma in bondi sphere ii will be cooled at a timescale of @xmath97yr via free - free emission , where @xmath98 and @xmath79 .
therefore it is expected that there is a steady accretion onto the seed black hole , but with a sub - eddington rate , which is self - regulated .
when the compton sphere forms , the pressure balance with its surroundings should hold , we have @xmath99 , where the subscript @xmath100 and @xmath101 represent compton sphere and its pre - feedbacked surroundings , respectively .
so we can get the bondi accretion rate @xmath102 inside the compton sphere in the form of @xmath29 and @xmath103 , @xmath104 where @xmath105 and @xmath106 .
with such a low accretion rate , the seed black hole can not grow significantly .    since @xmath107 ,
the accretion onto the black hole from the bondi sphere i is continuing , then the matter will pile up between the region of @xmath108 .
such a dense shell will collapse when pressures are not powerful enough to balance it .
thus the accretion onto the seed black holes could be pulsive with a period .
however , the oscillating accretion will be avoided if the outflow is supplied .
wind / outflow is a generic property of the accretion disk .
there are many pieces of evidence for the presence of strong outflows from accretion disks . in the quasar
pg 1211 + 143 , the outflow is indicated by the blueshifted x - ray absorption lines with a velocity of @xmath109 and has an outflow mass rate @xmath110 ( pounds et al .
similar strong outflows are found in ultraluminous x - ray sources ( mukai et al .
2003 , fabbiano et al . 2003 ) and ss 433 which clearly has strong outflows ( @xmath111 ) from the highly super - critical accretion disk ( kotani et al .
a strong outflow is expected to develop from the tiny accretion disk , leading to efficient kinetic feedback to its surroundings . here
we neglect the detailed micro - physics of the interaction between outflow and medium .
the kinetic luminosity is given by @xmath112 , where @xmath113 is the fraction of the outflow to the accretion rate and we take @xmath114 .
the simple energy budget can provide a rough estimation of the outflow kinetic energy .
when the outflow is damped by its surroundings , its most kinetic energy will dissipate at the sonic radius @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the temperature of the surroundings ( begelman 2004 ) .
this radius is much smaller than the characterized radius of the fat disk ( @xmath117 ) , but it is comparable to the inner quasi - spheric part of the cold fat disk .
the kinetic luminosity ( @xmath118 ) can compensate the free - free radiation loss of the hot plasma within the radius @xmath119 . for a typical outflow ,
the timescale of reaching the sonic point is @xmath120yr .
it would be interesting to note that this feedback timescale is much shorter than the compton heating in the present case .
we could draw a conclusion that the kinetic feedback from the outflow does play an important role in the growth of the seed hole .
on the other hand , the mass loss through the strong outflow definitely prevents the seed holes from growth .
however the mass rate of the outflow is uncertain , we do not know exactly how the growth of the seed holes is affected via mass loss .
finally , we would like to point out that we use the self - similar solutions of the super - eddington accretion ( wang & zhou 1999 ) based on the slim disk ( abramowicz et al 1988 ) .
the super - critical accretion remains a matter of debate since there are several instabilities , especially the photon bubble instability ( gammie 1998 ) .
the instability results in inhomogeneity of the disk , allowing the trapped photons to escape from the disk and enhance the disk radiation . if we employ the radiation leakage model at a level of @xmath121 ( begelman 2002 ) , the feedback will be much stronger than we have discussed above .
thus the results from the present paper is a lower limit of feedback .
for simplicity , we assume the radiation is isotropic from the tiny accretion disk
. the anisotropic radiation from the slim disk could suppress the compton heating in some degrees .
the self - similar solution gives the ratio of the height to the radius @xmath122 , where @xmath11 is the viscosity parameter ( wang & zhou 1999 ) .
the half - opening angle is about @xmath123 , the radiation will be confined within @xmath124 of the @xmath125 solid angle .
this assumption is reasonable .
however the anisotropic radiation from the tiny disk may lower the feedback of the compton heating .
future work will consider how the anisotropy effects the feedback for a time - dependent situation , which is beyond the scope of the present paper .
there are other possible ways to form supermassive black holes .
the direct collapse of primordial clouds in which the angular momentum is removed by the cosmic background photons ( loeb 1993 , loeb & rassio 1994 ) can form a @xmath126 black hole at @xmath127 .
if the seed black hole accrets dark matter , its growth is not suffering from the strong feedback ( hu et al .
. the inevitable fate of a compact cluster is the formation of a supermassive black hole ( quinlan & shapiro 1990 ) .
these possible ways might apply to different environments in the universe , it depends on future observations to test them .
we show that the feedback of the radiation pressure , compton heating and outflows from the super - critical accretion disks will result in strong influence on the accretion itself .
we show that the compton heating almost quenches the super - critical accretion and the outflow from the tiny disk heats up the outer region so that accumulation of matter is avoided .
a rapid growth of seed black holes is greatly suppressed and they are hardly able to grow up unless the strong feedback can be avoided , for example considering the anisotropy of the radiation from the tiny accretion disk .

 we studied the feedback of radiation pressure , compton heating and outflow during the seed black hole growth .

 , the kinetic feedback of the strong outflow heats the medium at large distance , this leads to a dramatical decrease of the outer bondi accretion onto the black hole and avoid the accumulation of the matter .

"there are a lot of answers to a question `` why does not a knot come loose ? '' .
the next example gives one of the answers .    in figure [ trefoil ] ,
the trefoil knot diagram is partitioned by 3 vertices into 3 edges @xmath0 and @xmath1 .
the edge @xmath2 is over @xmath3 , @xmath3 is over @xmath1 and @xmath1 is over @xmath2 .
this relation is known to be a three - way deadlock .
it seems that this is one of the factors that why a knot can not come loose .
throughout this paper we work in the piecewise linear category .
we shall study knots and links in the three - dimensional euclidean space @xmath4 . for the standard definitions and results of knots and links
, we refer to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .
let @xmath5 be a knot or link and @xmath6 be a diagram of @xmath5 .
we partition @xmath6 by @xmath7 vertices into @xmath7 edges @xmath8 .
we assume that each component of @xmath5 has at least one vertex .
we call such a diagram @xmath6 an _ @xmath7-partitioned diagram_.    an @xmath7-partitioned diagram @xmath6 is an
_ @xmath7-cycle presentation _ of @xmath5 if    1 .
each edge of @xmath6 has no self - crossing . 2 .
for any pair of two edges @xmath9 and @xmath10 , exactly one of the following holds . 1 .
@xmath9 is over @xmath10 at every crossing of @xmath9 and @xmath10 .
@xmath9 is under @xmath10 at every crossing of @xmath9 and @xmath10 .
3 .   there is no crossing of @xmath9 and @xmath10 .
we define an _ edge number _ @xmath11 of @xmath5 as the minimum number of @xmath7 where @xmath7 is taken over all @xmath7-cycle presentation of @xmath5 .
we can make a directed graph @xmath12 from an @xmath7-cycle presentation @xmath6 as follows .    1 .   for each edge @xmath9 , we assign a vertex @xmath13 to @xmath12 .
2 .   for two edges @xmath9 and @xmath10 which have at least one

@xmath10 , then we assign an oriented edge from @xmath9 to @xmath10 ( resp . from @xmath10 to @xmath9 ) to @xmath12 .

if we exclude the condition ( 2 ) in the definition of an @xmath7-cycle presentation , then any knot has a 2-cycle presentation .

we expect that @xmath22 is a candidate .
( of proposition [ non - trivial ] )    ( @xmath23 ) suppose that @xmath24 and let @xmath6 be a 1-cycle presentation of @xmath5 .
then by the definition ( 1 ) of an @xmath7-cycle presentation , @xmath6 has no crossing .
hence @xmath5 is trivial .
next suppose that @xmath25 and let @xmath6 be a 2-cycle presentation of @xmath5 .
@xmath6 has two edges @xmath2 and @xmath3 and without loss of generality we may assume that @xmath2 is over @xmath3 at every crossings of @xmath2 and @xmath3 . then by the definition ( 1 ) of an @xmath7-cycle presentation , @xmath6 is a 1-bridge presentation with an over - bridge @xmath2 and an under - bridge @xmath3 .
hence @xmath5 is trivial .
( of proposition [ 3-cycle ] ) let @xmath6 be a 3-cycle presentation of @xmath5 with three edges @xmath0 and @xmath1 .

. then we can regard the subarc @xmath36 as a single edge @xmath38 , and the new edge @xmath38 satisfies the definition ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) of an @xmath7-cycle presentation .

hence we obtain an @xmath39-cycle presentation of @xmath5 and this contradicts @xmath28 .

"in the seventeenth century , kepler discovered the laws of the motion of celestial objects . since then , a fundamental problem has been how to determine the orbital elements ( and the mass ) of a binary from observational data of its positions projected onto a celestial sphere .
in fact , astrometric observations play an important role in astronomy through determining a mass of various unseen celestial objects currently such as a massive black hole ( miyoshi et al .
1995 ) , an extra - solar planet ( benedict et al . 2002 ) and two new satellites of pluto ( weaver et al .
2006 ) .
the orbit determination of _ resolved double stars _ was solved first by savary in 1827 , secondly by encke 1832 , thirdly by herschel 1833 and by many authors including kowalsky , thiele and innes ( aitken 1964 for a review on earlier works ; for the state - of - the - art techniques , e.g , eichhorn and xu 1990 , catovic and olevic 1992 , olevic and cvetkovic 2004 ) . here , resolved double stars are a system of two stars both of which can be seen .
the relative vector from the primary star to the secondary is in an elliptic motion with a focus at the primary .
this relative vector is observable because the two stars are seen . on the other hand , an _
astrometric binary _ is a system of two objects where one object can be seen but the other can not like a black hole or a very dim star . in this case , it is impossible to directly measure the relative vector connecting the two objects , because one end of the separation of the binary , namely the secondary , can not be seen .
the measures are made in the position of the primary with respect to unrelated reference objects ( e.g. quasars ) whose proper motion is either negligible or known .
there are two major problems in determination of a binary orbit : ( 1 ) observational errors and ( 2 ) the conditional equations which connect the observable quantities with the orbital parameters .
the conditional equations are not only non - linearly coupled but also transcendental because of kepler s equation ( e.g. , goldstein 1980 , danby 1988 , roy 1988 , murray and dermott 1999 , beutler 2004 ) .    as a method to determine the orbital elements of a binary , an analytic solution in an explicit form has been found by asada , akasaka and kasai ( 2004 , henceforth aak ) by assuming no observational errors .
this solution is given in a closed form by requiring neither iterative nor numerical methods .
the purpose of this brief article is to extend the aak solution considering observational data .
we will summarize the aak solution in @xmath0 2 , next extend the solution considering observational data in @xmath0 3 , and make a computational test of the extended solution in @xmath0 4 .
here we briefly summarize our notation and formulation for ideal cases without any observational error .
we consider only the keplerian motion of a star around the common center of mass of a binary system by neglecting motions of the observer and the common center in our galaxy .
let @xmath1 denote the cartesian coordinates on a celestial sphere .
a general form of an ellipse on the celestial sphere is @xmath2 which is specified by five parameters @xmath3 since the center , the major / minor axes and the orientation of the ellipse are arbitrary . here
, we should note that the origin of the coordinates is arbitrary in this paper , while it is taken at the position of the primary star in the case of resolved double stars ( for instance , aitken 1967 ) .
at least five observations enable us to determine the parameters by using the least square method as @xmath4 where the location of the star on the celestial sphere at the time of @xmath5 for @xmath6 is denoted by @xmath7 . the inverse of a matrix in the l. h. s. exists uniquely .
in some case such as a large observational error , however , the determinant of the matrix can become nearly zero .
then , it would be more difficult to estimate the inverse matrix .
the time interval between observations is denoted by @xmath8 for @xmath9 .
we choose the cartesian coordinates @xmath10 so that the observed ellipse given by eq .
( @xmath11 ) can be reexpressed in the standard form as @xmath12 where @xmath13 .
the ellipticity @xmath14 is @xmath15 .
there exists such a coordinate transformation as a combination of a translation and a rotation , which is expressed as @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are given by @xmath19 and @xmath20 is determined by @xmath21 then , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 .
it has been recently shown ( asada et al . 2004 ) that the orbital elements can be expressed explicitly as elementary functions of the locations of _ four _ observed points and their time intervals if astrometric measurements are done _ without _ any error .
the key thing is that even after a keplerian orbit is projected onto the celestial sphere , the law of constant - areal velocity ( e.g. , goldstein 1980 , danby 1988 , roy 1988 , murray and dermott 1999 , beutler 2004 ) still holds , where the area is swept by the line interval between the star and the projected common center of mass but not a focus of the observed ellipse .
for example , let us consider four observed points @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 for @xmath32 . the location @xmath33 of the projected common center is given ( asada et al .
2004 ) by @xmath34 where @xmath35 and the eccentric anomaly in the observed ellipse is given by @xmath36 . what eqs .
( @xmath37 ) and ( @xmath38 ) tell us is the relative position of the projected common center of mass with respect to the center of the observed ellipse , that is the origin of our coordinates system .
if one wishes to take the origin of the coordinates as another point such as the location of the primary star , @xmath33 must be shifted by the displacement from the center of the observed ellipse to the new point .
the above solution is generalized to determination of an open orbit ( asada 2006 ) .
in reality , however , we have observational errors in each position measurement .
we assume that these random errors obey the gaussian distribution .
when the errors vanish , any set of four points @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 @xmath43 among observational data must satisfy eqs .
( @xmath37 ) and ( @xmath38 ) , if one replaces @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 .
all of @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 in eqs .
( @xmath37 ) and ( @xmath38 ) have been determined up to this point and @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the parameters to be estimated .
we should note that eqs .
( @xmath37 ) and ( @xmath38 ) are _ linear _ in parameters @xmath51 and @xmath52 to be determined by the least square method .
hence , @xmath53 becomes square in @xmath51 and @xmath52 so that the extremum of @xmath53 can tell us @xmath54 where the summation is taken for every set of four points @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 with a correspondence as @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 for defining @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 by eqs .
( @xmath59)-(@xmath60 ) , and the number of all the combinations is @xmath61 . in practice , the number of summing , namely a denominator of eqs .
( @xmath62 ) and ( @xmath63 ) , can be reduced significantly from @xmath64 to @xmath65 in the case of @xmath66 , if one considers only a set of four points as @xmath67 for @xmath68 .
it is worthwhile to mention that each point @xmath69 appears only once in this case , and the reduction is useful when applied to a lot of data .
the mapping between the observed ellipse and the keplerian orbit parameterized by the major axis @xmath70 and the ellipticity @xmath71 is specified by the inclination angle @xmath72 and the ascending node @xmath73 ( see fig .
1 ) .    given @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , one can analytically determine the remaining parameters @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath70 and @xmath73 in order as ( asada et al .
2004 ) @xmath74 where @xmath75
in this section , we verify the present formula by numerical computations for various values of the orbital parameters . in order to make a verification , we assume random errors in measurements of positions of the star and show that the orbital parameters are reconstructed : first , we assume a keplerian orbit specified by @xmath70 and @xmath71 and a projection defined by @xmath72 and @xmath73 .
we prepare twenty seven sets of the parameters as @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 deg . and @xmath79 deg .
for each test , we pick up twelve points in the original kepler orbit by assuming the same time interval between neighboring points for simplicity .
next , for assumed @xmath72 and @xmath73 , we estimate the projected locations of the twelve points in the apparent ellipse plane . we add random errors to each point in order to imitate a `` measured position '' with observational errors ( see fig .
2 ) . in order to produce such a simulated data , we assume that the absolute standard deviation of the random error in the position measurement is 0.001 in the units of @xmath76 .
we apply our formula to the simulated data in order to determine the orbital elements , and make a comparison between the assumed value and the retrieved one .
table 1 shows a good agreement between them . for each parameter
set , we perform a hundred of numerical runs for a statistical treatment .
we define an error as the absolute standard deviation as @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , where the prime denotes values retrieved by using the present formula and the square bracket denotes a mean over each set . in table 1 , asterisk ( @xmath84 ) indicates that the formula does not always give a real value but a complex one .
the case of complex numbers occurs because a large error in measurements of the positions in the apparent ellipse plane causes an anomaly in the apparent motion such as an apparent clockwise motion even if a true one is anti - clockwise .
it is worthwhile to make a comment on table 1 : in the case of no inclination as @xmath85 , the ascending node does not exist , so that an error in retrieving @xmath73 can be apparently quite large , though it is harmless .
in this paper , as a simplified method to determine a binary orbit , we extend the solution considering observational data . we expect that the present formula will be used for orbit determinations by some planned astrometric space missions such as sim ( shao 2004 ) , gaia ( mignard 2004 , perryman 2004 ) and jasmine ( gouda et al .
2004 ) , which will observe with the accuracy of possibly a few micro arcseconds a number of binaries whose components are a visible star and a companion ranging from a black hole to an extra - solar planet .
our numerical computations correspond to a case that by these missions we observe a binary system at a distance of 1 kpc from us , where the semimajor axis of the primary s orbit is around 1au .

"the control of light signal with the magnetic state or conversely the light sensing of the magnetic state is a key issue in the contemporary information technology , as realized in many magneto - optical devices and elements .
most of the magneto - optical functions exploit the change of light polarization with the magnetic state , usually generating the light polarization rotation ( kerr or faraday rotation ) . on the other hand ,
the magnetic - field change of optical absorption itself , i.e. , magnetochromism , is usually very small in spite of the potential demands in spin - electronic science and technology .
this is reasonable since the electronic resonance is usually tied to the magnetic state only through spin - orbit interaction in the magnetic medium .
some exceptions are found for the materials endowed with inherent strong charge - spin coupling and magnetically controllable competing orders , such as spin - crossover complexes @xcite , colossal - magnetoresistive oxides @xcite , and low - dimensional molecular magnets @xcite . even for these materials
, however , a high magnetic field of several tesla is necessary to cause the gigantic magnetochromism .    a more promising candidate to host the gigantic magnetochromism is the multiferroic compound , where the electricity and magnetism is inherently coupled @xcite .
such a coupling is recently evidenced for a variety of oxide compounds , as typified by the magnetic field control of ferroelectricity in tbmno@xmath9 @xcite and by the electric field control of the magnetization in gdfeo@xmath9 @xcite . as a consequence of such a strong magnetoelectric response , a number of multiferroics may have the potential to show the magnetic resonance in the dielectric constant @xmath10 spectrum , in addition to ( or rather than ) the magnetic permeability spectrum .
this collective mode , now termed electromagnon , becomes electrically active and thus can be excited by the light @xmath11 vector .
this is contrasted by the case of the conventional magnetic resonance ( the @xmath12 magnon ) driven by the light @xmath13 vector .
indeed , recent optical experiments at terahertz frequencies have revealed the emergence of the electromagnon in a family of multiferroics @xcite ; @xmath14mno@xmath9 ( @xmath15 rare earth ions ) @xcite , @xmath14mn@xmath0o@xmath16 @xcite , ba@xmath0mg@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath2 @xcite , cufe@xmath17ga@xmath18o@xmath0 @xcite , and ba@xmath0coge@xmath0o@xmath19 @xcite . as the origin of the electromagnons observed in antiferromagnets with non - collinear spin configurations such as @xmath14mno@xmath9 , the exchange - striction mechanism is proposed @xcite : the non - collinear spins ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 on the neighboring @xmath22-th and @xmath23-th sites ) can produce the local polarization @xmath24 in response to @xmath11 component of light , as given by @xmath25 .
in fact , the spectral shape of the electromagnon in @xmath14mno@xmath9 can be reproduced by this mechanism @xcite . as only the scalar product @xmath26 on
the underlying lattice is relevant , the electromagnon should be insensitive to the direction of the spiral spin plane , as already confirmed by the experiments applying the magnetic field on dymno@xmath9 @xcite .    among several magnetoelectrics to host electromagnons , a hexaferrite ,
ba@xmath0mg@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath2 investigated here , occupies a unique position .
recent combined studies of terahertz time - domain spectroscopy and inelastic neutron scattering have revealed the emergence of the electromagnon around 0.7 thz ( corresponding to 2.8 mev in photon energy ) @xcite ; the electromagnon becomes active in the conical spin ordered phase when the light @xmath11 vector is set parallel to the propagation vector along [ 001 ] [ see fig .

[ figcrstal](d ) ] . noticeably , in magnetic fields along [ 001 ] , ba@xmath0mg@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath2 yields the large saturation magnetic moment ( @xmath29 @xmath30 per f.u .
; f.u . , formula unit ) .
this enables us to easily modify the electromagnon inherent to the conical spin phase [ see the inset of fig . [ fige001pd](a ) ] , as compared to other multiferroics with the antiferromagnetic order ( no net spontaneous magnetization ) .
another remarkable characteristic of ba@xmath0mg@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath2 is the emergence of the ferroelectricity by controlling the spin cone with magnetic field @xcite : transverse conical structure , as realized by declining the cone axis toward [ 100 ] [ see the inset of fig . [ fige100pd](a ) ] , can produce the ferroelectricity .
in such a transverse spiral or conical magnet , the spontaneous polarization stems from the spin - current @xcite or inverse dzyaloshinskii - moriya mechanism @xcite , as expressed by @xmath31 ; here @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 are the spin at @xmath22-th site , the unit vector connecting @xmath22- and @xmath23-th sites , and the coupling constant , respectively .
this scenario is well proved also for this compound by the detailed analysis of the magnetic structure @xcite .
the application of external magnetic field is highly efficient for control of @xmath4 ; @xmath4 can be changed from 90@xmath35 to 0@xmath35 .
therefore , the transverse conical structure , where the screw axis is perpendicular to the propagation vector , can host the ferroelectricity along [ 120 ] . according to recent neutron scattering experiments
, @xmath4 was found to increase from nearly 0@xmath35 at 50 k to 20@xmath35 at 25 k @xcite . from the viewpoint of the magnetochromism
, the magnetically - flexible conical spin structure is expected to produce the dramatic modification of the electromagnon spectrum .    for this purpose , we perform the terahertz time - domain spectroscopy and fully map out the spectrum of the electromagnon in a variety of the spin - ordered phases of ba@xmath0mg@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath2 by tuning the magnetic field ( up to 7 t ) . the preliminary experiments in the zero and low magnetic field ( up to 0.2 t ) have identified the existence of electromagnon @xcite . here
we reveal the gigantic magnetochromism via electromagnons at terahertz frequencies with the fine control of the conical spin order .
furthermore , we could determine the magnetoelectric phase diagram of ba@xmath0mg@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath2 by conversely using the electromagnon spectra as the probe .
the format of this paper is as follows : in sec .
ii we describe the experimental setup for terahertz time - domain spectroscopy combined with a split - type superconducting magnet .
section iii is devoted to the systematic optical investigations of the electromagnons in a variety of spin - ordered phases tuned by magnetic fields ( from the proper screw to the ferrimagnetic through the conical spin - ordered phases ) , in which we reveal the important role of the conical spin order to produce the electromagnon activity by the measurements in paraelectric longitudinal ( sec .
iii a ) and ferroelectric transverse ( sec .
iii b ) conical spin - ordered phases .
on the basis of the results of sec .
iii , we discuss in sec .
iv the possible origin of the electromagnon activity in terms of the symmetric - exchange mechanism .
the conclusion is given in sec .
the single - crystalline samples were prepared by a flux method as described in ref . , and their magnetic and ferroelectric characteristics were all consistent with previous results .
the obtained samples were mechanically polished to the thickness of 70 300 @xmath36 m ( thickness of the sample is different in the measurements at respective temperatures so as to gain the signal - to - noise ratio ) .
we used the terahertz time - domain spectroscopy in a transmission geometry to directly estimate the complex dielectric constant spectra .
our experimental scheme using the znte crystal as a terahertz emitter was reported in ref . .
in the present experiments , to further access the low - energy electrodynamics of the electromagnon , especially down to 0.3 thz ( 1.2 mev in photon energy ) , we used the photoswitching sampling technique with a low - temperature - grown gaas ( lt - gaas ) as a terahertz emitter , as schematically shown in fig .
[ figthzsetup ] .
the femtosecond laser pulses delivered from the mode - locked ti : sapphire laser ( center wavelength of 800 nm ; pulse width of 100 fs ; repetition rate of 82 mhz ) were impinged on the photoswitching device made on the lt - gaas with dipole - antenna .
the radiated terahertz pulse was collimated by a pair of off - axis paraboloidal mirrors and focused on the another photoswitching device made on the lt - gaas ; the induced photocurrent was monitored in time - domain by changing the arrival time of the trigger femtosecond laser pulse . in this setup , we inserted the split - type superconducting magnet ( up to 7 t ) in between off - axis paraboloidal mirrors . to eliminate the contribution of the conventional magneto - optical effects , we adopted the voigt geometry , where the light @xmath37 vector is perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field .
the polarization of the radiated terahertz pulse was carefully tuned by a wire - grid polarizer .    with use of the fast fourier transformation of the measured terahertz pulse in time domain
, we obtained the amplitude and phase spectra with and without the sample . from the obtained complex transmission
, we numerically estimated the complex refractive constants @xmath38 , where @xmath39 and @xmath36 are complex dielectric constants and complex magnetic permeability , respectively . as we previously confirmed on the basis of the measurements of the light polarization dependence ( both the electric - field and magnetic - field components of light ) using crystal plates with different crystal orientations@xcite , the contribution of @xmath40 to @xmath41 was negligible in the measured frequency range , namely @xmath42 . in this paper , therefore , we used @xmath43 as a quantity .
further details of our estimation procedure were reported in ref . .
first , we examine the temperature evolution of the electromagnon in zero magnetic field . the light @xmath11 vector was set parallel to [ 001 ] to induce the electromagnon . in the proper screw phase in the temperature range of 19050 k
, there is no signature of electromagnons in the imaginary part of the dielectric constant @xmath44 spectra , as shown in figs .
[ fige001spectral](b ) to [ fige001spectral](d ) . below 50 k , where the longitudinal conical spin order evolves [ fig .
[ figcrstal](d ) ] , the sharp resonance can be discerned in @xmath45 spectrum and its peak magnitude reaches about 6 , as exemplified by the @xmath45 spectrum at 6 k [ fig .
[ fige001spectral](a ) ] .
this absorption was assigned to the electromagnon , inherent to the longitudinal conical spin ordered phase , on the basis of the combined measurements of the complete set of the light - polarization dependence as well as of the magnetic excitation spectrum with use of the inelastic neutron scattering @xcite .
next , we applied the magnetic field along [ 001 ] at 6 k so as to control @xmath4 of the longitudinal conical structure . in the experiments in magnetic fields
@xmath13 , we adopted the voigt geometry to exclude the contribution of the conventional magneto - optical effects such as faraday rotation .
owing to the ferrimagnetic nature of ba@xmath0mg@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath2 , the magnetization along [ 001 ] increases with magnetic field and yields a large magnetic moment about @xmath29 @xmath30/f.u . at 7 t [ fig . [ fige001pd](a ) ] .
the saturated magnitude of @xmath46 is consistent with the anticipated ferrimagnetic order , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 sublattice blocks were perfectly directed along [ 001 ] , as schematically shown in the inset of fig . [
fige001pd](a ) .
therefore , we could roughly estimate @xmath4 as a function of magnetic field , as given by @xmath47 [ fig . [ fige001pd](a ) ] . at 6 k in zero magnetic field
, @xmath4 was estimated to be 20@xmath35 , which is consistent with the measured value by the recent neutron scattering experiments @xcite .
about 3 t , we can induce the ferrimagnetic phase as @xmath4 nearly reaches about 90@xmath35 . in magnetic fields ,
there is a remarkable change of the electromagnon @xmath45 spectra [ fig . [ fige001spectral](a ) ] ; this is viewed as the gigantic terahertz magnetochromism . with increasing magnetic field
, the electromagnon grows in spectral intensity and reaches the maximum around 1 t , as can be seen in fig . [
fige001spectral](a ) .
the relative change of the magnitude of @xmath45 at 0.76 thz with and without magnetic field was estimated to be @xmath48 300% in 0.6 t. with further increasing magnetic field , the intensity of the electromagnon decreases and the peak position shifts to the lower energy .
the electromagnon resonance disappears above 3 t in the ferrimagnetic ( all spin collinear ) phase .
further noticeable magnetochromism can be seen in the @xmath45 spectra at 64 k on the verge of the transition from the proper screw to longitudinal conical spin structures [ fig .
[ fige001spectral](b ) ] .
the tendency that the intensity of the electromagnon increases with increasing magnetic field is similar to the case at 6 k [ fig .
[ fige001spectral](a ) ] , except for the behavior below 0.5 t. in zero magnetic field , the proper screw state is stable , hence no electromagnon is observed . even in weak magnetic fields below 0.5 t
, we can induce the electromagnon , via the evolution of the longitudinal conical spin order , as identified in the @xmath45 spectrum around 0.1 t. therefore , near this temperature , the magnetochromism is strongly enhanced ; the relative absorption change yields a gigantic value , @xmath48 500% at 0.6 thz even at 0.6 t. with increasing temperature , the value of the relative change tends to decrease , since the application of magnetic field can hardly induce the longitudinal conical spin phase , as exemplified by the @xmath45 spectra at 90 k [ fig .
[ fige001spectral](c ) ] .
finally , at 164 k , @xmath45 spectrum is found to be independent of magnetic field ( @xmath49 t ) [ fig . [ fige001spectral](d ) ] .    to quantify this trend ,
we show in fig .
[ fige001pd](b ) the contour plot of the spectral weight ( sw ) , as defined by the integration of the optical conductivity ( = @xmath50 , @xmath51 being a permittivity of vacuum ) between 0.4 thz to 1 thz , in the plane of temperature and magnetic field .
open circles represent the measured points .
the scale color bar is shown at the right side of the figure ; for example , red region indicates the maximum value of the sw .
this contour plot clearly reflects the magnetic @xmath52)$ ] phase diagram of ba@xmath0mg@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath2 . in the restricted area of the phase diagram ,
the longitudinal conical spin ordered phase is identified with the enhanced electromagnon spectral intensity dependent on @xmath4 . the present experiments with use of the electromagnon as a probe can provide the full - range phase diagram including the thermal and magnetic - field variations among the proper screw , conical , and collinear structures .
in ba@xmath0mg@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath2 , we can also induce the transverse conical structure by applying the magnetic field along [ 100 ] . in this phase
, the ferroelectricity emerges along [ 120 ] , i.e. , along the direction perpendicular to both the magnetic @xmath53-vector @xmath54)$ ] and the conical axis @xmath55)$ ] , as is evidenced by the measurements of the spontaneous polarization [ fig .
[ fige100pd](a)]@xcite .
figure [ fige100spectra ] presents the @xmath45 spectra at respective temperatures in magnetic fields @xmath55)$ ] up to 7 t. in zero magnetic field , a signature of the electromagnon at 0.7 thz is discerned only in the longitudinal conical spin phase , e.g. , at 5 k [ fig . [ fige100spectra](a ) ] . when the magnetic field was applied along [ 100 ] at 5
k , the magnetization steeply increases around 0.2 t [ fig . [ fige100pd](a ) ] .
accordingly , the spontaneous polarization emerges and reaches the maximum about 80 @xmath36c / m@xmath56 .
these are all consistent with the transformation from the longitudinal to transverse conical spin orders , which was directly confirmed by the recent polarized neutron scattering experiments @xcite .
the similar magnetochromism is observed in the electromagnon spectra to case of @xmath57 $ ] ( fig .
[ fige001spectral ] ) ; @xmath45 increases first with increasing magnetic field and reaches the maximum at around 1 t , and finally , the electromagnon resonance disappears about 3 t , at which the transverse conical spin order transforms to the ferrimagnetic order as evidenced by the reduction of the spontaneous polarization [ fig .
[ fige100pd](a ) ] .
thus , the emergence of the electromagnon is only limited to the conical spin ( transverse conical for @xmath58 $ ] , and hence ferroelectric in this case ) phase . in turn , we uniquely determine the magnetic phase diagram with use of the electromagnon spectral intensity as a probe .
we show in fig .
[ fige100pd](b ) the contour plot of the sw ( the integrated optical conductivity from 0.3 thz to 1.2 thz ) in the plane of temperature and magnetic fields .
thus , we can identify the region , where sw shows the enhancement in the conical spin arrangement , as colored in red and yellow .
the solid lines are the guides to indicate the ferroelectric phase in the phase diagram , as inferred from the recent neutron scattering experiments @xcite , which is consistent with our present data . on the basis of the such mapping of the electromagnon activity in terms of temperature and magnetic field ,
we confirm again that the conical spin order can act as an effective source of the electromagnons , whose intensity critically depends on @xmath4 .
although the detailed theoretical study is needed , the most plausible scenario to explain the above behaviors of the electromagnon is to consider the symmetric exchange - striction mechanism . as extensively discussed in @xmath14mno@xmath9 as the model case @xcite ,
the non - collinear spins with the symmetric ( heisenberg type ) exchange interaction @xmath59 causes the electromagnon activity through the relationship , @xmath25 , when the local electric dipole is tied to the @xmath60 bond . according to the detailed magnetic structure analysis of ba@xmath0mg@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath2 by neutron scattering @xcite , @xmath27 and @xmath28 sublattice blocks are composed of the stacking of fe ions along [ 001 ] , as labeled by  1 ' ,  4 ' ,  5 ' ,  8 ' ,  11 ' ,  12 ' ,  11@xmath61 ' ,  8@xmath61 ' ,  5@xmath61 ' ,  4@xmath61 ' , and
 1@xmath61 ' [ fig .
[ figdiscussion](a ) ] .
figure [ figdiscussion](b ) shows the reported spin arrangement at respective fe sites within the plane in the ferrimagnetic phase at 294 k @xcite . in this phase
, the spins are all collinear .
therefore , @xmath62 is perpendicular to @xmath21 and thus @xmath24 in response to @xmath63 $ ] is always zero , as schematically shown in the lower panel of fig . [ figdiscussion](b ) . on the other hand ,
the spins become non - collinear in the proper screw spin phase below 195 k. the spin arrangement within the plane in this phase is schematically shown in fig .
[ figdiscussion](c ) ; the turn angle of @xmath64 at 77 k was taken from ref . .
the electromagnon activity would be possible in this phase [ see the lower panel of fig .
[ figdiscussion](c ) ] .
however , this mechanism can not explain the present experimental results , where there is no remarkable signature of the electromagnon in the proper screw phase [ figs .
[ fige001pd](b ) and [ fige100pd](b ) ] .
this is partly due to the fact that the in - plane @xmath65 ( scaled with the transition temperature @xmath66 k ) is large compared to the measured photon energy range ( @xmath67 6 mev ) . in this proper screw spin phase of ba@xmath0mg@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath2 , @xmath27 and @xmath28
spins lie only within the plane [ fig . [ figdiscussion](c ) ] . on the contrary ,
spins decline toward [ 001 ] in the longitudinal conical ordered phase below 50 k , where the electromagnon shows up .
the spin component projected on to ( 120 ) plane , emphasized at fe  4 ' ,  5 ' , and  8 ' sites , is schematically shown in fig .
[ figdiscussion](d ) ; the upper , middle , and lower panels stand for the situations , where @xmath4 is @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and 0@xmath35 , respectively . in the case for @xmath7 , there emerges another route to @xmath24 as @xmath62 is not perpendicular to @xmath21 .
for example , we can consider @xmath70 produced around fe  5 ' site while simply assuming @xmath71 } , 0 , -s^{[001]})$ ] and @xmath72 } , 0 , s^{[001]})$ ] @xcite , the situation for @xmath73 is schematically shown in the middle panel of fig .
[ figdiscussion](d ) .
we then obtain non - zero component of @xmath70 along [ 001 ] , being proportional to @xmath74}$ ] . in this simple consideration
, the intensity of the electromagnon should be scaled with @xmath75 and reach the maximum at @xmath73 [ middle panel of fig . [ figdiscussion](d ) ] . in the longitudinal conical spin phase at 6 k ( fig . [ fige001pd ] ) , for example , the observed sw of the electromagnon reaches the maximum around 1 t , which nearly corresponds to @xmath73 . in the both ferrimagnetic phases induced by magnetic field along [ 001 ] or [ 100 ] ,
electromagnons become inactive ( figs .
[ fige001pd ] and [ fige100pd ] ) as all the spins become collinear within the projection of ( 120 ) plane [ upper panel of fig .
[ figdiscussion](d ) ] , being consistent with this mechanism .
contrary to the origin of the ferroelectricity , i.e. the antisymmetric exchange interaction described by vector spin chirality @xmath76 , the symmetric exchange interaction @xmath77 acting along [ 001 ] is likely the dominant source of the observed electromagnons .
uniquely , such a symmetric exchange interaction depends on @xmath4 .
therefore , the magnetic field control of @xmath4 ranging from @xmath78 and @xmath68 can produce the gigantic terahertz magnetochromism via electromagnons as we observed here .
in conclusion , we performed the terahertz time - domain spectroscopy for a variety of the magnetically ordered phases of the hexaferrite ba@xmath0mg@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath2 , while tuning temperature and magnetic field .
the electromagnon appears only in the conical spin ordered phase but irrespective of the longitudinal or transverse conical form , while no electromagnon is observed in the proper screw nor ferrimagnetic phase .
the intensity of the electromagnon is found to be highly sensitive to the conical angle tuned by external magnetic fields .
such a sensitivity can provide the unique opportunity to determine the magnetoelectric phase diagram in a wide range of temperature and magnetic field . from the technical viewpoint , we clarified that the electromagnon can induce the gigantic magnetochromism at terahertz frequencies ; the estimated relative change of @xmath45 ( @xmath79% ) is remarkably large even in a magnetic field as low as 0.6 t. the important implication of the present work is that the source of the electromagnon is not limited to multiferroics ; electromagnon resonance emerges irrespective of the presence of the ferroelectricity .
there are a variety of non - collinear magnets at room temperature , which are candidates to potentially host the gigantic magnetochromism via electromagnons .

therefore , to be precise , its magnitude should be different .
this also produces the non - zero component along [ 100 ] . even in this case , the present discussion is valid in the context that the non - zero component along [ 001 ] emerges only in the conical spin ordered phase .

furthermore , there is no chance to produce the electromagnon activity with @xmath4 of @xmath78 or 90@xmath35 .
these are all consistent with present experiments . ]" ," effects of temperature ( 6225 k ) and magnetic field ( 07 t ) on the low - energy ( 1.25 mev ) electrodynamics of the electromagnon , the magnetic resonance driven by the light electric field , have been investigated for a hexaferrite magnet ba@xmath0mg@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath2 by using terahertz time - domain spectroscopy . 
 we find the gigantic terahertz magnetochromism via electromagnons ; the magnetochromic change , as defined by the difference of the absorption intensity with and without magnetic field , exceeds @xmath3% even at 0.6 t. the results arise from the fact that the spectral intensity of the electromagnon critically depends on the magnetic structure . 
 with changing the conical spin structures in terms of the conical angle @xmath4 from the proper screw ( @xmath5 ) to the ferrimagnetic ( @xmath6 ) through the conical spin - ordered phases ( @xmath7 ) by external magnetic fields , we identify the maximal magnetochromism around @xmath8 . on the contrary 
 , there is no remarkable signature of the electromagnon in the proper screw and spin - collinear ( ferrimagnetic ) phases , clearly indicating the important role of the conical spin order to produce the magnetically - controllable electromagnons . 
 the possible origin of this electromagnon is argued in terms of the exchange - striction mechanism . "

there are various approximation algorithm for solving the problem .
however , in practice , a heuristic known as the k - means algorithm ( also known as lloyd s algorithm ) is used because of its excellent performance on real datasets even though it does not given any performance guarantees .
this algorithm is simple and can be described as follows :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ * ( k - means algorithm ) * : ( i ) arbitrarily , pick @xmath0 points @xmath19 as centers .
( ii ) cluster the given points based on the nearest distance of points to centers in @xmath19 .
( iii ) for all clusters , find the mean of all points within a cluster and replace the corresponding member of @xmath19 with this mean .
repeat steps ( ii ) and ( iii ) until convergence . _

this means that this _ local search _ algorithm may either converge to a local optimum solution or may take a large amount of time to converge  @xcite .
poor choice of the initial @xmath0 centers ( step ( i ) ) is one of the main reasons for its bad performance with respect to approximation factor .
a number of _ seeding _ heuristics have been suggested for picking the initial centers .
one such seeding algorithm that has become popular is the k - means++ seeding algorithm .
the algorithm is extremely simple and runs very fast in practice .
moreover , this simple randomized algorithm also gives an approximation factor of @xmath4 in expectation  @xcite . in practice
, this seeding technique is used for find the initial @xmath0 centers to be used with the k - means algorithm and this guarantees a theoretical approximation guarantee .
the simplicity of the algorithm can be seen by its simple description below :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ * ( k - means++ seeding ) * : pick the first center randomly from among the given points . pick a point to be the @xmath2 center ( @xmath20 ) with probability proportional to the square of the euclidean distance of this point to the previously @xmath3 chosen centers . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    a lot of recent work has been done in understanding the power of this simple sampling based approach for clustering .
we discuss these in the following paragraph .
arthur and vassilvitskii  @xcite showed that the sampling algorithm gives an approximation guarantee of @xmath4 in expectation .
they also give an example dataset on which this approximation guarantee is best possible .
et al . _
@xcite and aggarwal _ et al . _
@xcite show that sampling more than @xmath0 centers in the manner described above gives a constant pseudo - approximation .
ackermann and blmer  @xcite showed that the results of arthur and vassilvitskii  @xcite may be extended to a large class of other distance measures .
et al . _
@xcite showed that the seeding algorithm may be modified appropriately to give a @xmath21-approximation algorithm for the k - means problem .
jaiswal and garg  @xcite and agarwal _ et al . _
@xcite showed that if the dataset satisfies certain separation conditions , then the seeding algorithm gives constant approximation with probability @xmath22 .
et al . _
@xcite showed that the seeding algorithm performs well even when fewer than @xmath0 sampling iterations are executed provided that more than one center is chosen in a sampling iteration .
we now discuss our main results .
the lower - bound examples of arthur and vassilvitskii  @xcite and aggarwal _ et al . _
@xcite have the following two properties : ( a ) the examples are high dimensional and ( b ) the examples lower - bound the _ expected _ approximation factor .
brunsch and rglin  @xcite discussed whether the k - means++ seeding gives better than @xmath4 approximation with probability @xmath23 .
they constructed a high dimensional example where this is not true and a @xmath4 approximation is achieved only with probability exponentially small in @xmath0 .
an important open problem mentioned in their work is to understand the behavior of the seeding algorithm on low - dimensional examples .
this problem is also mentioned as an open problem by mahajan _
et al . _
@xcite who examined the hardness of the k - means problem on @xmath24-dimensional datasets . in this work ,
we construct a two dimensional dataset on which the k - means++ seeding algorithm achieves an approximation ratio of @xmath8 ( for some universal constant @xmath8 ) with probability exponentially small in @xmath0 .
following is the main theorem that we prove in this work .
let @xmath25 and @xmath26 .
consider the discrete version of the k - means problem .
there exists a two dimensional dataset @xmath16 such that the probability that the k - means++ algorithm gives an approximation factor better than @xmath27 on @xmath16 is at most @xmath28 .    for the non - discrete version ,
we get the above statement with approximation factor @xmath29 .      all the known lower - bound examples  @xcite have the following general properties :    1 .
all optimal clusters have equal number of points .
the optimal clusters are high dimensional simplices .    in order to construct a counterexample for the two dimensional case
, we consider datasets that have different number of points in different optimal clusters .
our counterexample is shown in figure  [ fig : example ] .
note that the optimal clusters are points at the end of the vertical bars and the cluster sizes decreases exponentially going from left to right .
we say that the seeding algorithm _ covers _ the @xmath2 optimal clusters if the algorithm picks a point from either of the ends of the @xmath2 vertical bar ( recall that this is the @xmath2 optimal cluster ) .
the proof follows from the following three observations about this dataset :    * * observation 1 * : once the @xmath2 cluster gets covered , the probability of covering any cluster @xmath30 in subsequent rounds is roughly the same for any @xmath31 .
moreover , there is a good chance that after the first few iterations , a cluster @xmath32 for some small @xmath32 gets covered . *
* observation 2 * : the algorithm needs to cover more than some constant fraction of clusters to achieve good ( another constant ) approximation . * * observation 3 * : given that a small numbered cluster ( clusters are numbered from left to right ) is covered in the initial few iterations , the probability of covering more than certain constant fraction of clusters is exponentially small in @xmath0 .    in the next section ,
we give the details of this proof .
the figure means that there are @xmath33 points each located at @xmath34 and @xmath35 .
there are @xmath36 points each located at @xmath37 and @xmath38 and so on . here
are some simple observations regarding this example : the total number of points is @xmath39 .
note that the optimal cost in the discrete version of the problem is @xmath40 .
moreover , this is when one center from each of the @xmath0 clusters ( vertical bars ) is chosen .
we denote the optimal clusters by @xmath41 from left to right .
note that the number of points in these clusters drops exponentially .
we say that an optimal cluster @xmath42 is _ covered _ by the k - means++ algorithm if the algorithm picks a point as a center from @xmath42 .
since the number of points in the initial few clusters are large , there is a good chance that in the initial few iterations of the k - means++ seeding algorithm , one center from these initial few clusters are chosen .
the next lemma shows this more formally .
[ lemma-1 ] let @xmath43and let @xmath44 .
let @xmath45 be the set of centers chosen by the k - means++ algorithm in the first @xmath46 iterations .
then @xmath47 \leq e^{-(\alpha \beta/3 ) k}\ ] ]    for @xmath48 , let @xmath49 denote the event that @xmath50 does not cover any cluster in @xmath51 .
we make the following observations : @xmath52 = 1 - \frac{m + m/2 ^ 2 + ... + m/2^{2 \beta k - 2}}{m + m/2 ^ 2 +   ... + m/2^{2k-2 } } = 1 - \frac{1 - 1/2^{2\beta k}}{1 - 1/2^{2k } } < 1/2^{2\beta k}\ ] ] we can also prove the following simple lemma .
@xmath53 \leq ( 1 - \beta/3)$ ]    consider centers @xmath54 . let @xmath30 be the smallest integer such that @xmath55 covers @xmath42 .
conditioned on the event @xmath56 , we have that @xmath57 .
let us partition the optimal clusters into the following 3 parts : the first partition is @xmath51 , the second partition is @xmath58 and the third partition is @xmath59 .
we note that @xmath60 = \frac{\phi_{c_{i-1}}(l)}{\phi_{c_{i-1}}(l ) + \phi_{c_{i-1}}(m ) + \phi_{c_{i-1}}(r)}\ ] ] note that @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 . using these inequalities
we get the following : @xmath64 \geq \frac{1}{2 + ( 1/2)\frac{k}{2^{2\beta k } } } \geq \frac{\beta}{3}\\ \rightarrow & & { { \bf pr}}[e_i | e_1 , ... , e_{i-1 } ] \leq 1-\frac{\beta}{3}\end{aligned}\ ] ]    so we get that @xmath65 \leq ( 1 - \beta/3)^{\alpha k } \leq e^{-(\alpha \beta/3 ) k}$ ] .
this completes the proof of lemma  [ lemma-1 ] .
the next lemma shows that unless a large number of optimal clusters get covered , the approximation factor is bad .
[ lemma-2 ] let @xmath19 denote the centers chosen by the k - means++ algorithm .
if @xmath19 covers @xmath66 clusters , then @xmath67    note that @xmath68 .
this is when all the optimal clusters are covered .
suppose @xmath19 is such that @xmath69 clusters are covered by @xmath19 .
let @xmath70 be an optimal cluster that is not covered with respect to @xmath19 .
then we have : @xmath71 using this , we have : @xmath72 so , we get @xmath73 .
we now need to show that the probability that k - means++ algorithm covers more than @xmath74 ( for some constant @xmath75 ) clusters is exponentially small in @xmath0 . to prove this , we define and analyze a random sampling procedure which may be of independent interest .      in this section
, we analyze a sampling procedure that will help in the analysis of the behavior of k - means++ for our counterexample .
this might be of independent interest .
the procedure is defined as follows :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ * sampball * : there are @xmath76 balls each colored with one of @xmath0 colors such that for each color there are exactly two balls with that color .
@xmath0 balls are sampled randomly without replacement out of these @xmath76 balls . _

we are interested in bounding the probability that @xmath77 contains balls with more than @xmath78 different colors .
let @xmath49 be the probability that @xmath77 contains of exactly @xmath32 distinct colors .
the next lemma bounds the probability of the event @xmath49 .    for any @xmath79 ,
@xmath80 \leq \frac{5}{\sqrt{k } } \cdot 2^{-k/16}$ ] .
let us consider the following alternative procedure @xmath81 : whenever a new colored ball is sampled , the procedure outputs the letter `` n '' and if a ball with the same color has already been sampled , then @xmath81 outputs `` o '' . note that @xmath80 $ ] is equal to the probability that @xmath81 outputs a string in @xmath82 such that there are exactly @xmath32
let @xmath83 be the random variable denoting the string output of @xmath81 .
then we have : @xmath84 & = & { { \bf pr}}[s \textrm { has exactly } i \textrm { n 's } ] \\ &
\leq & \binom{k}{i } \cdot { { \bf pr}}[s = \underbrace{nn ... n}_{i\ terms } \underbrace{oo ... o}_{(k - i)\ terms } ] \\ & = & \binom{k}{i } \cdot \frac{2k}{2k } \cdot \frac{2(k-1)}{2(k-1 ) + 1 } ...
\frac{2(k - i+1)}{2(k - i+1 ) + i-1 } \cdot \frac{i}{i+2(k - i ) } ...
\frac{2i - k+1}{k+1}\\ & = & \binom{k}{i } \cdot \frac{2^i \cdot ( k!)^2 \cdot i!}{(k - i ) !
\cdot ( 2k ) ! \cdot ( 2i - k)!}\\ & = & \frac{2^i \cdot ( k!)^3}{((k - i)!)^2 \cdot ( 2k ) ! \cdot ( 2i - k ) ! } \\ & \leq & \frac{2^{7k/8 } \cdot ( k / e)^{3k } \cdot e^3 \cdot k^{3/2}}{2\pi \cdot ( k/8 ) \cdot ( k/8e)^{k/4 } \cdot \sqrt{2\pi } \cdot \sqrt{2k } \cdot ( 2k / e)^{2k } \cdot \sqrt{2\pi } \cdot \sqrt{k/2 } \cdot ( 3k/4e)^{3k/4 } } \\ & = & \frac{2 \cdot e^3 \cdot 2^{3k/4 + 7k/8 } \cdot ( 4/3)^{3k/4}}{\pi^2 \cdot \sqrt{k } \cdot 2^{2k } } \\ & \leq & \frac{2 \cdot e^3 \cdot 2^{3k/4 + 7k/8 + 5k/16}}{\pi^2 \cdot \sqrt{k } \cdot 2^{2k } } \\ & \leq & \frac{5}{\sqrt{k } } \cdot 2^{-k/16}\end{aligned}\ ] ]    this gives us the following useful corollary .
@xmath85 \leq 5 \sqrt{k } \cdot 2^{-k/16}$ ] .
the relationship of the sampling procedure * sampball * with the counter - example should not be very difficult to see .
sampling a ball with new color corresponds to sampling a center from an uncovered cluster and so on .
the main difference is that sampling a center from a new cluster is more likely than sampling a ball with new color .
we modify our sampling procedure to be able to use the analysis for analyzing k - means++ over our counterexample .
here is our new sampling procedure :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ * biasedsampball * : there are @xmath76 balls each colored with one of @xmath0 colors such that for each color there are two balls with that color .
@xmath0 balls are sampled randomly without replacement out of these @xmath76 balls .
there is a bias towards sampling balls of new color . when sampling a ball the probability of sampling a ball of new color is at most @xmath86 times more than the probability of sampling a ball with color that has already been picked .

this gives us the following useful corollary .
@xmath92 \leq \sqrt{k } \cdot 2^{-k/64}$ ] .      in this section
, we will prove that the k - means++ algorithm covers at most @xmath74 clusters for some universal constant @xmath75 .
this in conjunction with lemma  [ lemma-2 ] gives the main theorem .
[ lemma : cover ] let @xmath93 and @xmath94 .
then we have : @xmath95 \leq ( 2\sqrt{k } ) \cdot 2^{-k/300}.\ ] ]    let @xmath96 denote the event that after the first @xmath97 iterations , the first @xmath97 cluster are uncovered . note that from lemma  [ lemma-1 ] , we have : @xmath98 \leq e^{-k/300}\ ] ] note that conditioned on the event @xmath99 , we have that in the remaining @xmath100 iterations the probability of sampling a center from either end of any uncovered cluster from the @xmath100 rightmost clusters is at most @xmath101 times the probability of sampling from the uncovered end of a covered cluster .
this is because the potential of the points at the uncovered end of a covered cluster is @xmath102 and the that of points in either end of an uncovered cluster is at most @xmath103 given that event @xmath99 happens . ]
so , we can use the analysis of the previous section .
we get that conditioned on the event @xmath99 , the probability that more than @xmath104 from the @xmath105 rightmost clusters will be covered is at most @xmath106 .
so we have : @xmath107 & \leq &   { { \bf pr}}[e ] + \\ & & { { \bf pr}}[\textrm{k - means++ covers more than } \eta k \textrm { clusters } | \neg e ] \\ & \leq & e^{-k/300 } + ( \sqrt{k } ) \cdot 2^{-k/128}\\ & \leq & ( 2\sqrt{k } ) \cdot 2^{-k/300}\end{aligned}\ ] ]    now the proof of the main theorem follows from the above lemma and lemma  [ lemma-2 ] .    from lemmas  [ lemma-2 ] and [ lemma :
cover ] , we get that : @xmath108 \leq ( 2\sqrt{k})\cdot 2^{-k/300}.\ ] ]
the k - median problem is similar to the k - means problem . here , the objective is to minimize the sum of euclidean distances rather than the sum of squares of the euclidean distances as in the k - means problem .
that is , the objective function to be minimized is @xmath109 , where @xmath110 denotes the euclidean distance between points @xmath15 and @xmath8 . for the k - median problem , we make appropriate changes to the seeding algorithm .
more specifically , we consider the following algorithm :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ * ( smpalg ) * : pick the first center randomly from among the given points .

note that the analysis of the previous section can be easily extended for this case .
in this work , we give a two dimensional example dataset on which the k - means++ seeding algorithm achieves a constant factor approximation ( for some universal constant ) with probability exponentially small in @xmath0 .
this is only the first step towards understanding the behavior of k - means++ seeding algorithm on low - dimensional datasets .
this addresses the open question of brunsch and rglin  @xcite .
brunsch and rglin gave a @xmath114-dimensional instance where the k - means++ seeding algorithm achieves @xmath4 approximation factor with exponentially small probability and ask whether similar instances can be constructed in small dimension . an interesting open question is whether we can show that the seeding algorithm gives better than @xmath4 approximation factor on instances in small dimension .

1321 , 13 july 2012 ." ," the k - means++ seeding algorithm is one of the most popular algorithms that is used for finding the initial @xmath0 centers when using the k - means heuristic .

 @xcite and by brunsch and rglin  @xcite . "
"usually , for cosmological phenomena over galactic scale or in the smaller scale , it is reasonable to consider inhomogeneous solutions to einstein equations .
szekeres [ 1 ] in 1975 , gave a class of inhomogeneous solutions representing irrotational dust .
the space - time represented by these solutions has no killing vectors and it has invariant family of spherical hypersurfaces .
hence this space - time is referred as quasi - spherical space - time .
recently , chakraborty et al [ 2 ] have extended the szekeres solution to @xmath0 dimensional space - time and generalized it for matter containing heat flux [ 3 ] .
+ in classical general relativity , one of the challenging issues is gravitational collapse .
this problem became important after the formulation of famous singularity theorems [ 4 ] and cosmic censorship conjecture ( ccc)[5 ] .
also in the perspective of black hole physics and its astrophysical implications , the end state of collapse ( black hole or naked singularity ) is interesting . as there exists no formal method to address this problem so it is natural to study various examples of collapsing system ( namely , tolman - bondi - lematre ( tbl ) spherically symmetric model [ 6 - 15 ] or quasi - spherical szekeres model [ 16 - 18 ] ) with a view to gain some insight . in general , these studies conclude that the local or global visibility of the central curvature singularity depends on the initial data .
+ the above studies are mostly confined to the dust model , there are very few works on anisotropic stress [ 19 ] ( confined to tbl model ) . for the last few years
, there are attempts to study collapse dynamics in tbl model with anisotropic pressure to address the question `` can non - zero pressures within a collapsing matter cloud avoid a naked singularity forming as the end state of a continual gravitational collapse ? '' but so far , the actual role the pressures play in determining the end state of collapse is not yet clearly understood . due to complicated nature of the space - time geometry there are no works on gravitational collapse with anisotropic stresses in quasi - spherical model except recently by chakraborty et al [ 20 ] where they have shown the role of pressure in 4 dimension .
+ in this work , we extend this study to @xmath0 dimensional szekeres model and examine the role of the dimension on collapse dynamics . the paper is organized as follows : higher dimensional szekeres model is described in section ii , while collapse dynamics including the study of geodesic is presented in section iii . in section iv , there are discussion and concluding remarks .
finally at the end there are two appendix dealing with detailed calculations .
the metric ansatz for ( n+2)dimensional szekeres space - time is of the form    @xmath1    where the metric coefficients @xmath2 and @xmath3 are functions of all space - time co - ordinates i.e. , @xmath4    now considering both radial and transverse stresses the energy momentum tensor has the structure    @xmath5    and the compact form of the einstein equations are    @xmath6    where @xmath7 and @xmath8 .
+ further , the expressions for the metric functions are    @xmath9    and the evolution equation for r gives    @xmath10    also the function @xmath11 satisfies    @xmath12=n(f(r)-1)\ ] ]    which has a solution of the form @xmath13 with the restriction , @xmath14    for the arbitrary functions @xmath15 , @xmath16 and c(r ) .
+ as we are considering quasi - spherical gravitational collapse so it is natural to assume the initial configuration ( from which the collapse has started ) to be smooth everywhere .
thus @xmath17 should be regular initially at the center and blows up at the singularity .
so a natural choice for @xmath17 is    @xmath18    where the arbitrary function @xmath19 has the form @xmath20 near @xmath21 to make initial @xmath17 finite ( non - zero ) at the centre @xmath21 and @xmath22 is any constant .
hence , the expressions for matter density and tangential stress become    @xmath23    and @xmath24+\frac{g'(r)}{nr^{l-1}(r'+r\nu')}\ ] ]    where @xmath25 and @xmath26 , an arbitrary integration function .
+ now , due to this choice of @xmath17 ( see eq ( 8) ) the evolution eq ( 4 ) for @xmath27 can be integrated once and the radial velocity of collapsing shell at a distance @xmath28 from the centre is given by    @xmath29    this is termed as the equation of the collapsing process .
to characterize the nature of the singularity ( black hole or naked singularity ) , the event horizon of observers at infinity plays an important role . but formation of event horizon depends greatly on the computation of null geodesics whose computation are almost impracticable for the present space - time geometry . so a closely related concept of a trapped surface ( a space - like 2-surface whose normals on both sides are future pointing converging null geodesic families ) will be considered .
thus , if the 2-surface @xmath30 ( @xmath31constant , @xmath32constant ) is a trapped surface then it and its entire future development lie behind the event horizon provided the density falls off fast enough at infinity . hence mathematically , if @xmath33 denotes the tangent vector field to the null geodesics which is normal to @xmath30 then we have @xmath34    now the null geodesics will converge ( or diverge ) if the invariant @xmath35 ( or @xmath36 ) on the surface @xmath37 . + as a consequence , it is easy to show that the inward geodesics converges initially and throughout the collapsing process while the outward geodesics diverges initially but becomes convergent after a time @xmath38 ( time of formation of apparent horizon ) given by @xmath39    now using equations ( 8) and ( 11 ) we have    @xmath40    from appendix ii , it is to be noted that the central singularity ( at @xmath21 ) forms at time @xmath41 while a trapped surface is formed at a distance @xmath28 at time @xmath38 and their difference is given by the equation ( 37 ) .
thus if the trapped surface is formed at a later instant than @xmath41 then it is possible for light signals from the singularity to reach a distant observer .
hence , @xmath42 is the necessary condition for formation of naked singularity and on the otherhand , @xmath43 is the sufficient condition for black hole formation .
also it should be mentioned that this criterion for naked singularity is purely local .
+ further , as the time difference equation ( 37 ) is complicated , so to make a comparative study between @xmath44 and @xmath41 one can choose for simplicity @xmath45 and equation ( 37 ) takes the form    @xmath46    the following table shows the possibility of naked singularity or a black hole under different conditions : + @xmath47 @xmath48    from the table , to make the initial density gradient to be negative at the centre ( i.e. , @xmath49 ) one must have @xmath50 ( for @xmath51 ) . for the first case ( i.e. , @xmath52 ) @xmath53 is negative definite and there is always naked singularity as in the dust model .
similarly , @xmath53 is positive definite in the second case which leads to black hole solution same as dust model . for the third and fourth cases ( when @xmath54 and @xmath55 have same sign ) either ns or bh is possible depending on the restrictions given in the table i ( see also figs 1 - 6 ) .
however , in the last two cases , for @xmath56 only black hole solution is possible but for @xmath49 , both ns and bh are possible .
+ further , if we assume that @xmath57 then the time difference in eq ( 37 ) becomes @xmath58~d_{0}^{\frac{1}{n-1}}~r^{\frac{3n+3 - 2l}{n-1}}+ ... ... ... \right]\ ] ]    we see that if @xmath59 ( with @xmath60 ) then the first term on the right side will be dominating compare to other terms and hence we always have @xmath61 .
thus in this case black hole is the only final state collapse for six and higher dimensional space - times .
this distinctive result is similar to dust collapse [ 13 , 16 ] and we conclude that ccc is valid in this case for six and higher dimension with anisotropic pressure .

figs.1 , 3 and 5 correspond to @xmath65 for @xmath66 and 25 respectively while figs.2 , 4 and 6 correspond to @xmath67 for @xmath66 and 25 respectively .      in this section , the nature of the singularity ( ns or bh )
is examined by studying the geodesics from the singularity . in particular , it will be investigated whether there exist one or more radial outgoing null geodesics which terminate in the past at the central singularity . for simplicity of calculation
only marginally bound case ( @xmath68 ) with @xmath45 will be considered ( as in the previous section ) . now choosing the initial time @xmath69 , the explicit solution for @xmath70 can be written as    @xmath71\ ] ]    thus the expression for the singularity time for the shell of radius @xmath27 is given by ( @xmath72 )    @xmath73\ ] ]    and consequently the time for central singularity is    @xmath74    here the polynomial form of @xmath26 and @xmath19 are taken in the form    @xmath75    where @xmath76 are constants and @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the first non - vanishing term beyond @xmath79 and @xmath80 respectively . now using these expression for @xmath26 and @xmath19 the time of collapse of a typical shell of radius @xmath27 ( i.e. , @xmath81 ) becomes ( see eq ( 16 ) )
@xmath82    now the equation of the outgoing radial null geodesic ( orng ) which passes through the central singularity , can be chosen to be ( near @xmath21 )    @xmath83    where @xmath84 and @xmath85 are constants .
+ in the polynomial form for @xmath26 and @xmath19 in the equation ( 18 ) one can choose two possibilities : @xmath86    * case i * :   @xmath87 : + here near @xmath21 , the expression for @xmath81 can be written as ( see eq.(19 ) ) @xmath88    in order that null geodesic passes through the shell of radius @xmath27 before the trapped surface is formed there , comparing ( 20 ) and ( 21 ) one gets ( @xmath89 ) @xmath90    when @xmath91 then near @xmath21 the solution for @xmath27 simplifies to    @xmath92^{2/n+1}\ ] ]    further for the given metric an orng should satisfy    @xmath93    now using ( 20 ) and ( 23 ) in ( 24 ) one gets ( up to leading order in @xmath28 )      this gives @xmath95^{2/(n+1)}\ ] ]    as @xmath91 , so from the above relations ( 26 )    @xmath96    on the other hand for @xmath97 , as before @xmath98 and    @xmath99^{(1-n)/(n+1)}~\times\end{aligned}\ ] ]    @xmath100\ ] ]    thus for @xmath91 , @xmath101 has only one value ( namely @xmath102 ) and @xmath103 can take any value ( @xmath104 ) while for @xmath97 the only possible values of @xmath103 are 2 and 3 only .
therefore , geodesic equations are possible in any dimension for @xmath91 but it is only possible up to five dimension for @xmath97 . in other words , for @xmath97 ,
naked singularity is possible only up to five dimension which supports the results in the previous section .
lastly , it should be mentioned that the other choice namely @xmath105 is similar to the above and hence not presented here .
a detailed analysis of the central curvature singularity as the final state of collapse in the ( @xmath106)-dimensional quasi - spherical szekeres model has been done for matter with anisotropic pressure ( i.e. , both radial and tangential pressures are non - zero and distinct ) .
the local visibility of the central singularity has been discussed by comparing the time of formation of trapped surface and the time of formation of central shell focusing singularity while global visibility is examined by considering only the radial null geodesics ( for simplicity ) .
most of the results are very similar to that for four dimension in ref . [ 13 ] .
it is to be noted that though we have considered quasi - spherical szekeres model but still these are valid for tbl model .
in fact , in szekeres solution if we assume the function @xmath11 to be independent of @xmath28 ( i.e. , @xmath107 ) then szekeres model can be converted to tbl model by the following coordinate transformation : + @xmath108    further , the radial pressure is assumed to be a function of ` @xmath28 ' and ` @xmath109 ' only with the form @xmath110 . throughout the paper @xmath22
is chosen to be less than @xmath111 ( i.e. , @xmath60 ) [ it is to be noted that for @xmath112 due to appearance of a logarithmic term the calculations become very much complicated while for @xmath113 the results are not of much interest ] . it has been shown that for @xmath114 i.e. , for @xmath115 , naked singularity is only possible up to five dimension  a result identical in dust collapse . the above choice ( i.e. , @xmath115 ) gives @xmath116 for @xmath117 and @xmath118 for @xmath119 .
hence for @xmath119 , if the initial density gradient falls off at the centre ( @xmath21 ) then one can say that six dimension plays as critical dimension for naked singularity , a distinct result in higher dimension .
further with the choice @xmath45 , a detailed comparative study has been done between the time of formation of trapped surface and that of central singularity and table i shows all possibilities for the parameters involved in the expression .
also in the figures 1 - 6 we have shown graphically the time difference @xmath62 for 6 , 14 and 27 dimensions for @xmath65 and @xmath67 respectively .
+ as in dust collapse , in this case we have definitely a black hole ( or naked singularity ) if the initial density gradient at the centre is positive definite ( or negative definite ) .
but in the indefiniteness in the sign of @xmath53 one may note that if the initial density and radial pressure has identical behaviour ( i.e. , increase or decrease simultaneously ) then even with initial negative density gradient ( at the centre ) it is possible to have black hole as the end state of collapse , while if the initial density and pressure have opposite nature ( i.e. , one increase when other decreases and vice versa ) then the behaviour is identical to dust collapse .
therefore one may conclude that pressure tries to resist the formation of naked singularity .
* initial hypersurface and the physical parameters : * + suppose the collapsing process starts on the initial hypersurface @xmath121 and we have @xmath122 there .
then the expressions for energy density , radial pressure and the tangential pressure , at the beginning of the collapse are          it is to be noted that in the above series expansions the coefficients @xmath128 s and @xmath129 s ( @xmath130 ) are purely constants while @xmath131 s , @xmath132 s and @xmath133 s are functions of @xmath134 s ( @xmath135 ) .
also these coefficients are not independent but are related among themselves through the relations in eq ( 29 ) as follows : + for @xmath51 : @xmath136      * solution of the evolution equation ( 11 ) with @xmath68 : * + for the initial choice @xmath122 at @xmath141 , the explicit solution is @xmath142-\frac{\sqrt{2n}~r^{\frac{n+1}{2}}}{(n+1)\sqrt{d(r)}}~_{2}f_{1}[\frac{1}{2},b , b+1 , \frac{g(r)r^{n+1-l}}{d(r)(n+1-l)}]\ ] ]            a comparison of equations ( 34 ) and ( 35 ) shows that the shell focusing singularity that appears at @xmath150 is in the future of the apparent horizon . however , the time of occurrence of central shell focusing singularity ( which is of main interest here ) is given by      where the series form of @xmath19 and @xmath26 ( from eq .
( 30 ) ) have been used in evaluating the limit .
thus for the restriction @xmath60 , the explicit form of the difference between @xmath38 and @xmath41 is        * acknowledgement : * + one of the authors ( sc ) is thankful to csir , govt .

"in this paper we study optimal investment problems for a financial market model with memory .
this market model @xmath2 consists of @xmath1 risky and one riskless assets .
the price of the riskless asset is denoted by @xmath3 and that of the @xmath4th risky asset by @xmath5 .
we put @xmath6 , where @xmath7 denotes the transpose of a matrix @xmath8 .
the dynamics of the @xmath0-valued process @xmath9 are described by the stochastic differential equation @xmath10 , \quad t\ge 0 , \\ \quad s_i(0)&=s_i,\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad i=1,\dots , n , \end{split } \label{eq:1.1}\ ] ] while those of @xmath3 by the ordinary differential equation @xmath11 where the coefficients @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 are continuous deterministic functions on @xmath15 and the initial prices @xmath16 are positive constants .
we assume that the @xmath17 volatility matrix @xmath18 is nonsingular for @xmath19 .
the major feature of the model @xmath2 is the @xmath0-valued driving noise process @xmath20 which has memory .
we define the @xmath21th component @xmath22 by the autoregressive type equation @xmath23 where @xmath24 , @xmath25 , is an @xmath0-valued standard brownian motion defined on a complete probability space @xmath26 , the derivatives @xmath27 and @xmath28 are in the random distribution sense , and @xmath29 s and @xmath30 s are constants such that @xmath31 ( cf .
anh and inoue @xcite ) .
equivalently , we may define @xmath22 by the moving - average type representation @xmath32 ds,\quad t\in\mathbf{r } \label{eq:1.5}\ ] ] ( see ( * ? ? ?
* examples 2.12 and 2.14 ) ) .
the components @xmath22 , @xmath33 , are gaussian processes with stationary increments that are independent of each other .
each @xmath22 has short memory that is described by the two parameters @xmath29 and @xmath30 . in the special case @xmath34
, @xmath22 reduces to the brownian motion @xmath35 . driving noise processes with short or long memory of this kind
are considered in @xcite , anh et al .
@xcite and inoue et al .
@xcite , for the case @xmath36 .
we define @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the @xmath39-null subsets of @xmath40 .
this filtration @xmath41 is the underlying information structure of the market model @xmath2 . from ( [ eq:1.5 ] )
, we can easily show that @xmath42 is a semimartingale with respect to @xmath43 ( cf .
* section 3 ) ) . in particular , we can interpret the stochastic differential equation ( [ eq:1.1 ] ) in the usual sense .
in actual calculations , however , we need explicit semimartingale representations of @xmath44 .
it should be noticed that ( [ eq:1.5 ] ) is not a semimartingale representation of @xmath44 ( except in the special case @xmath34 ) . for
, @xmath35 involves the information of @xmath45 with @xmath46 and vice versa .
the following two kinds of semimartingale representations of @xmath44 are obtained in ( * ? ? ?

i.e. , an @xmath49-valued standard brownian motion such that @xmath50 notice that @xmath51 s are independent of each other .
the point of and is that the deterministic kernels @xmath52 and @xmath53 are given explicitly by @xmath54 with @xmath55 , \quad s\ge 0 .
\label{eq:1.10}\ ] ] we have the equalities @xmath56    many authors consider financial market models in which the standard driving noise , that is , brownian motion , is replaced by a different one , such as fractional brownian motion , so that the model can capture _ memory effect_. to name some related contributions , let us mention here comte and renault @xcite , rogers @xcite , heyde @xcite , willinger et al .
@xcite , barndorff - nielsen and shephard @xcite , barndorff - nielsen et al .
@xcite , hu and ksendal @xcite , hu et al .
@xcite , elliott and van der hoek @xcite , and heyde and leonenko @xcite . in most of these references ,
driving noise processes are assumed to have stationary increments since this is a natural requirement of simplicity . among such models ,
the above model @xmath2 driven by @xmath44 which is a gaussian process with _ stationary increments _ is possibly the simplest one .
one advantage of @xmath2 is that , by the semimartingale representations ( [ eq:1.6 ] ) and ( [ eq:1.7 ] ) of @xmath44 , it admits _ explicit calculations _ in problems such as those considered in this paper .
another advantageous feature of the model @xmath2 is that , assuming @xmath57 , real constants , we can easily estimate the characteristic parameters @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath58 from stock price data .
we consider this parameter estimation in appendix c.    for the market model @xmath2 , we consider an agent who has initial endowment @xmath59 and invests @xmath60 dollars in the @xmath4th risky asset for @xmath61 and @xmath62x^{x,\pi}(t)$ ] dollars in the riskless asset at each time @xmath63 , where @xmath64 denotes the agent s wealth at time @xmath63 .
the wealth process @xmath64 is governed by the stochastic differential equation @xmath65\frac{ds_0(t)}{s_0(t ) }   + \sum\nolimits_{i=1}^{n}\pi_i(t)\frac{ds_i(t)}{s_i(t ) } , \quad   x^{x,\pi}(0)=x .
\label{eq:1.12}\ ] ] here , we choose the self - financing strategy @xmath66 from the admissible class @xmath67 for the finite time horizon of length @xmath68 , where @xmath69 denotes the euclidean norm of @xmath0 . if the time horizon is infinite , we choose @xmath70 from the class @xmath71 let @xmath72 and @xmath73 . in this paper , we consider the following three optimal investment problems for the model @xmath2 : @xmath74 , \tag{\textbf{p1}}\\ & j(\alpha):=\sup_{\pi\in\mathcal{a } } \limsup_{t\to\infty }    \frac{1}{\alpha t}\log e\left[(x^{x,\pi}(t))^{\alpha}\right ] , \tag{\textbf{p2}}\\ & i(c):=\sup_{\pi\in\mathcal{a } } \limsup_{t\to\infty}\frac{1}{t } \log p\left[x^{x,\pi}(t)\ge e^{ct}\right ] .
\tag{\textbf{p3}}\end{aligned}\ ] ]    the goal of problem p1 is to maximize the expected utility of wealth at the end of the finite horizon .
this classical optimal investment problem dates back to merton @xcite .
we refer to karatzas and shreve @xcite and references therein for work on this and related problems . in hu et al .
@xcite , this problem is solved for a black  scholes type model driven by fractional brownian motion . in section [ sec:2 ] , assuming @xmath75 for @xmath33 , we explicitly solve this problem for the model @xmath2 .
our approach is based on a cameron  martin type formula which we prove in appendix a. this formula holds under the assumption that a relevant riccati type equation has a solution , and the key step of our arguments is to show the existence of such a solution ( lemma [ lem:2.1 ] ) .
the aim of problem p2 is to maximize the growth rate of expected utility of wealth over the infinite horizon .
this problem is studied by bielecki and pliska @xcite , and subsequently by other authors under various settings , including fleming and sheu @xcite , kuroda and nagai @xcite , pham @xcite , nagai and peng @xcite , hata and iida @xcite , and hata and sekine @xcite . in section [ sec:3 ] , we solve problem p2 for the model @xmath2 by verifying that a candidate of optimal strategy suggested by the solution to problem p1 is actually optimal . in so doing , existence results on solutions to riccati type equations ( lemmas [ lem:2.1 ] and [ lem:3.5 ] ) play a key role as in problem p1 .
the result of nagai and peng @xcite on the asymptotic behavior of solutions to riccati equations , which we review in appendix b , is also an essential ingredient in our arguments .
the purpose of problem p3 is to maximize the large deviation probability that the wealth grows at a higher rate than the given benchmark @xmath76 .
this problem is studied by pham @xcite , in which a significant result , that is , a duality relation between problems p2 and p3 , is established .
subsequently , this problem is studied by hata and iida @xcite and hata and sekine @xcite under different settings . in section [ sec:4 ] ,
we solve problem p3 for the market model @xmath2 . in the approach of @xcite
, one needs an explicit expression of @xmath77 . since our solution to problem
p2 is explicit , we can solve problem p3 for @xmath2 using this approach .
as in @xcite , our solution to problem 3 is given in the form of a sequence of nearly optimal strategies .
for @xmath78 with certain constant @xmath79 , an optimal strategy , rather than such a nearly optimal sequence , is obtained by ergodic arguments .
in this section , we consider the finite horizon optimization problem p1 for the market model @xmath2 . throughout this section , we assume @xmath72 and @xmath80 thus @xmath75 rather than @xmath81 ( see remark [ rem:2.6 ] below ) .

* theorem 5.2 ) and liptser and shiryayev ( * ? ? ?

[ rem:2.4 ] we can regard @xmath172 , which is the only random term on the right - hand side of , as representing the memory effect . to illustrate this point ,
suppose that @xmath173 is a constant matrix .

"the new particle discovered at the lhc in 2012 was identified as a higgs boson  @xcite . with the current lhc data , its measured properties are consistent with those of the higgs boson in the standard model ( sm )  @xcite . on the other hand , so far , no evidence for new physics beyond the sm has been found directly at the lhc .
therefore , our standard picture for high energy particle phenomena , which is based on the gauge theory with spontaneous symmetry breaking , seems successful .
however , it has been well known that the higgs sector in the sm is problematic from the theoretical viewpoint .
first of all , the existence of the scalar boson causes the hierarchy problem  @xcite , so that many physicists try to understand the essence of the higgs boson , e.g. , elementary or composite particle . in order to solve the hierarchy problem ,
several scenarios for the new paradigm have been introduced such as supersymmetry , dynamical symmetry breaking and extra dimensions .
each of them gives a different answer for the question of essence of the higgs boson .
second , there is no principle for the structure of the higgs sector , so that the minimal higgs sector adopted in the sm is just an assumption .
there are many possibilities of non - minimal higgs sectors with additional scalar fields such as singlets , doublets and triplets .
a model based on the above - discussed paradigms can predict the specific structure and property of the higgs sector .
for example , the minimal supersymmetric sm ( mssm ) predicts the higgs sector with two isospin doublet scalar fields  @xcite .
in addition , non - minimal higgs sectors can also be introduced in new physics models to explain the origin of neutrino masses , the existence of dark matter and baryon asymmetry of the universe , _ et cetera _ , which can not be explained in the sm .
each new physics model predicts a characteristic structure for the higgs sector .
therefore , if the higgs sector is determined by experiments in future , the new physics scenario can be selected from many candidates .    to probe the extended higgs sectors , the simplest way is to directly search for additional higgs bosons such as the second scalar boson . by measuring its properties
; e.g. , the mass , the electric charge , the spin and the parity , important information to reconstruct the higgs sector can be extracted .
non - observation of the second higgs boson gives the experimental constraint on the parameter space in the higgs sector .
current bounds from searches for additional higgs bosons at the lhc with the collision energy of 7 and 8 tev can be found in refs .  @xcite .
in addition to the direct search results , precision measurements of various low energy observables can be an indirect search for extended higgs sectors , since the existence of additional higgs multiplets can affect them .
the electroweak rho parameter defined in terms of the masses of the @xmath1 boson @xmath2 and the @xmath3 boson @xmath4 , and the weak mixing angle @xmath5 by @xmath6 is one of the most important tools to constrain the structure of the higgs sector , whose experimental value is very close to unity ; i.e. , @xmath7  @xcite . in the sm , the rho parameter is predicted to be unity at the tree level . in general , in extended higgs sectors , predicted values for the rho parameter can deviate from unity . in the higgs sector with arbitrary number of scalar fields @xmath8 ( a hypercharge @xmath9 and an isospin @xmath10 ) with vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) @xmath11 , the rho parameter is calculated at the tree level by  @xcite @xmath12\ , v_i^2 } { 2\,\sum_i y_i^2\ , v_i^2}.   \label{eq : rho_tree } \ ] ] from eq .
( [ eq : rho_tree ] ) , an additional vev of a higgs field satisfying with @xmath13 does not change the value of the rho parameter from the sm , doublets with @xmath14 and septets with @xmath15 .
the next possibility to the septet representation is isospin 26-plet with @xmath16 . ] .
a vev of a higgs multiplet without satisfying the above equation ; e.g. , a triplet higgs field , deviates @xmath17 from unity , so that we need finetuning for such a vev to avoid the constraint from @xmath18 . however , even if the above equation is not satisfied , by allowing an alignment among vevs , we can keep @xmath19 . the simplest realization is known as the georgi - machacek ( gm ) model  @xcite whose higgs sector is composed of additional real and complex triplet fields with @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively .
the above discussion is very useful to discriminate extended higgs sectors .
however , the rho parameter has been measured quite precisely , so that we need to take into account quantum effects to the rho parameter .
let us discuss how the rho parameter is modified at the one - loop level .
the deviation of the rho parameter from unity measures the violation of the custodial @xmath22 symmetry  @xcite in the sector of particles in the loop , we need a different prescription for the calculation of the radiative corrections to the rho parameter from that in models with @xmath23 , because of an additional input parameter in the electroweak sector . in the higgs sector with a real triplet higgs field with @xmath24 , one - loop corrections to the rho parameter have been calculated in refs .
@xcite . that has been applied to the higgs sector with a complex triplet higgs field with @xmath25 in refs .  @xcite . in the gm model
, although @xmath19 can be satisfied , similar prescription in models with @xmath26 is necessary due to the vev alignment  @xcite . ] .
for example , in the yukawa lagrangian , the custodial symmetry is broken by the mass splitting between the top and bottom quarks . as a result
, the deviation of the rho parameter from unity @xmath27 due to the loop contribution of the top and bottom quarks takes a form of @xmath28 .
in fact , since @xmath29 , there remains @xmath30 dependence in @xmath31 . on the other hand ,
the higgs potential in the sm respects the custodial symmetry , so that the higgs boson loop contribution is at most the logarithmic dependence of the higgs boson mass through the hypercharge gauge interaction .
however , in general , the custodial symmetry is broken in extended higgs sectors .
for example , in two higgs doublet models ( thdms ) , the mass splitting between singly - charged higgs bosons and a cp - odd higgs boson gives a quadratic mass dependence similarly to the top and bottom quark contributions in @xmath31  @xcite .
therefore , a sizable amount of the mass difference has already been excluded  @xcite . in the above way
, we can take bounds on various physical parameters by comparing precisely measured observables with theory predictions with radiative corrections .
experimental data for flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) processes such as @xmath32 and the @xmath33-@xmath34 mixing strongly constrain extended higgs sectors with multi - doublet structures .
the way to avoid such dangerous fcnc processes at the tree level is to assign a different quantum number for each higgs doublet .
consequently , each quark or lepton can obtain its mass from only one higgs doublet just like in the sm , and therefore the model escapes fcnc processes at the tree level . in the thdm , for example , this can be achieved by imposing a discrete @xmath0 symmetry to the model  @xcite as the simplest way , which can be softly - broken in the potential .
there are four independent types of yukawa interactions under the @xmath0 symmetry  @xcite , which are called as type - i , type - ii , type - x and type - y  @xcite .
how can we explore extended higgs sectors ?
it is important to understand that in general , a new scale @xmath35 is introduced in extended higgs sectors , which is irrelevant to the vev of the higgs boson .
when @xmath35 is much larger than the tev scale , the mass of the second higgs boson is approximately given by @xmath35 . in this case , the second higgs boson is too heavy to be discovered directly at the lhc .
in addition , the indirect effect of new particles decouples from the low energy observables  @xcite such as the coupling constants of the discovered higgs boson .
however , if @xmath35 is as high as the tev scale , there can be two possibilities in searches for additional higgs bosons .
the first possibility is that the second higgs boson can be discovered directly at the lhc . in this case
, the properties can be directly measured at the lhc , and the useful information to determine the structure of the higgs sector can also be obtained at the high luminosity ( hl)-lhc  @xcite .
the second possibility is that it can not be discovered directly , but its indirect effect on the higgs couplings can be significant and thus detectable by precision measurements at the hl - lhc and at the international linear collider ( ilc )  @xcite .
it goes without saying that in order to realize the second possibility a small but detectable mixing between the sm - like higgs boson and an additional higgs boson is required . in this case ,
in addition to obtaining information on the mass of the second higgs boson , the structure of the higgs sector could be determined without the direct discovery by finding the pattern in deviations in various higgs boson couplings  @xcite . on the other hand ,
if @xmath35 stays at the electroweak scale , a large mixing between the sm - like higgs boson and an additional higgs boson can occur , and the higgs boson couplings can deviate significantly from the sm values .
if the last scenario is realized , both the direct search and the indirect search are possible to determine the higgs sector .
the direct search for additional higgs bosons in thdms at the lhc has been discussed in refs .
@xcite after the discovery of the higgs boson .
the complementarity of additional higgs boson searches at the lhc and at the ilc is recently discussed in ref .
@xcite .    in this paper
, we discuss how the structure of the higgs sector can be determined at the lhc and at the ilc .
in particular , we shed light on complementarity of direct searches of additional higgs bosons at the upcoming 13 tev or 14 tev run of the lhc and precision measurements of the coupling constants of the discovered higgs boson at future collider experiments .
we consider extended higgs sectors which satisfy @xmath36 without predicting fcncs at the tree level ; i.e. , the thdm with the softly - broken @xmath0 symmetry , the doublet - singlet model  @xcite , the gm model  @xcite and the doublet - septet model  @xcite . for the thdm , we discuss the four types of yukawa interaction .
we at first give a detailed explanation for properties in the thdms such as the decay branching ratio , perturbative unitarity and vacuum stability .
we then analyze the direct search for additional neutral higgs bosons at the lhc .
the expected excluded regions on the mass of extra neutral higgs bosons are shown assuming the 14 tev energy at the lhc .
next , as the indirect search , we show various patterns of deviations in the gauge interaction @xmath37 and the yukawa interactions @xmath38 of the sm - like higgs boson @xmath39 from the sm predictions .
we show the deviation in the @xmath38 couplings in the thdms . for the rest models
, we also show those in the @xmath38 and @xmath37 couplings , where these models predict universal modifications for the @xmath38 couplings .
we use the latest results of allowed values of the higgs boson couplings which have been obtained from the global fit to all higgs data  @xcite in order to compare the various prediction of deviations in the higgs boson couplings and @xmath37 couplings in the thdms and in the models with universal modification of the @xmath38 couplings .
we update the plots for the @xmath38 and @xmath37 couplings with more detailed explanations by using the latest data  @xcite . ] .
this paper is organized as follows . in section
ii , we define the higgs potential and yukawa lagrangian in the thdm with the softly - broken @xmath0 symmetry . after we derive the yukawa couplings in the four types , we discuss the decay branching ratios of the higgs bosons .
the bounds from unitarity and vacuum stability are also discussed . in section iii , we study the direct search for the additional higgs bosons at the lhc . in section iv , we present expected accuracy of the precise measurement of the higgs boson couplings at the ilc , and then we discuss the deviation in the sm - like higgs boson couplings are calculated in the thdms and models with universal yukawa couplings .
complementarity between the direct search and the indirect search at the lhc and at the ilc is discussed in section iv .
conclusion is summarized in section v.
the higgs potential of the thdm under the softly - broken @xmath0 symmetry to avoid fcnc at the tree level and the cp invariance is given by  @xcite @xmath40 , \label{pot_thdm2}\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the isospin doublet scalar fields with @xmath43 whose @xmath0 transformation is given as @xmath44 and @xmath45 .
the two higgs doublet fields can be parameterized as @xmath46,\hspace{3mm}(i=1,2 ) , \end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the vevs of two doublet fields .
they are related to the fermi constant @xmath49 by @xmath50 .
the ratio of the two vevs is defined as @xmath51 .
the mass eigenstates for the scalar bosons are obtained by the following orthogonal transformations as @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the nambu - goldstone bosons absorbed by the longitudinal component of @xmath55 and @xmath3 , respectively .
the masses of @xmath56 and @xmath57 are calculated as @xmath58 where @xmath59 describes the soft breaking scale of the @xmath0 symmetry  @xcite .
the masses for the cp - even higgs bosons @xmath39 and @xmath60 , and the mixing angle @xmath61 are given by @xmath62 where @xmath63 with @xmath64 .
we define the range of @xmath65 to be @xmath66 $ ] or @xmath67 $ ] , in which for a given positive value of @xmath68 , @xmath69 is positive or negative , respectively .
.four types of the charge assignment of the @xmath0 symmetry . [ cols='^,^,^,^,^,^,^',options='header ' , ]     we consider higgs sectors with a universal shift in the yukawa coupling constants .
such a situation can be realized in a higgs sector composed of only one doublet field ; e.g. , a model with a scalar doublet plus singlets , triplets and higher isospin multiplets , or in a higgs sector with multi - doublet fields but only one of them giving all the fermion masses ; e.g. , the type - i thdm . in the following ,
we first discuss the doublet - singlet model , the type - i thdm and the doublet - septet model , and then we consider the gm model as models with @xmath19 .
we note that these extended higgs sectors can predict larger deviations in the @xmath37 couplings as compared to those in models with @xmath70 , because an amount of the deviation depends on an additional vev whose magnitude is constrained by the rho parameter if it causes @xmath70 .    in the doublet - singlet model and the doublet - septet model , an isospin singlet field with @xmath24 and an isospin septet field with @xmath71
are contained , respectively , in addition to the doublet scalar field @xmath72 with @xmath43 .
the type - i thdm was already defined in section ii . from eq .
( [ eq : rho_tree ] ) , a vev from the additional scalar multiplet does not change @xmath73 from the sm value .    except the vev of the singlet scalar field , all the vevs from the additional higgs multiplet @xmath74
contribute to the electroweak symmetry breaking .
they satisfy @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the vev of @xmath72 and @xmath77 = 1 and 4 in the type - i thdm and the doublet - septet model , respectively .
it is convenient to define the ratio of the vevs as @xmath78 .
there are two cp - even scalar states in these three models , and they are mixed with the angle @xmath61 as @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 denote the cp - even scalar components from @xmath72 and an additional scalar multiplet , respectively .
the @xmath39 and @xmath60 fields are the mass eigenstates , and we assume that @xmath39 is the observed higgs boson with the mass of about 126 gev .    next , we discuss the gm model whose higgs sector is composed of a real ( @xmath24 ) and a complex ( @xmath25 ) triplet scalar fields in addition to @xmath72 . when the vevs of two triplet fields are aligned to be the same ( @xmath82 ) , @xmath19 is satisfied , where the contributions to the deviation in @xmath73 from unity by the triplet vevs are cancelled with each other .
the value of @xmath77 defined in the above is given as @xmath83 .    in the gm model ,
there are three cp - even scalar states from @xmath72 and two triplets .
they are mixed with each other in the following way  @xcite @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 are respectively the cp - even scalar components in the @xmath24 and @xmath25 triplet higgs fields , and @xmath87 is the neutral component of the custodial su(2 ) 5-plet higgs boson .    in table
[ tab : scalingfactor ] , we list the scaling factors @xmath88 and @xmath89 in terms of @xmath61 and @xmath90 in the four models . in the doublet - singlet model , @xmath88 and
@xmath89 have the same expression @xmath91 , because both the yukawa interaction and the gauge interaction are originated from the doublet higgs field , and they are suppressed by the same origin ; i.e. , the mixing between doublet and singlet fields .    in the type - i thdm , both the yukawa couplings and the gauge couplings are suppressed by @xmath88 and @xmath89 , respectively .
however , @xmath92 is generally allowed unlike the doublet - singlet model .
we have already mentioned in subsection  ii a that we can take the sm - like limit by @xmath93 , where both @xmath88 and @xmath89 become unity .
similar limit can be defined in the doublet - singlet model by taking @xmath94 .    in the gm model and the doublet - septet model
, the vev of the additional multiplet affects the electroweak symmetry breaking in a different way from that by the doublet higgs field ; i.e. , @xmath95 in the gm model and the doublet - septet model are different in the type - i thdm . as a result , @xmath89 can be larger than 1 ( see table  [ tab : scalingfactor ] ) .
this is a unique feature to identify these models .
furthermore , the limit of @xmath96 and @xmath97 is taken by setting @xmath98 and @xmath99 which corresponds to the special case in the type - i thdm .     and
@xmath89 in models with universal yukawa coupling constants.,width=453 ]    in fig .
[ fig : kvkf ] , we show predictions of the scaling factors @xmath88 and @xmath89 for each value of @xmath61 and @xmath90 in the models with universally modified yukawa couplings .
if we vary @xmath61 and @xmath90 , a model dependent area ( line ) is drawn , which is a distinctive prediction of the models .
note that predictions are the same at @xmath100 in the type - i thdm , the gm model , and the doublet - septet model . from the current lhc data ,
the scaling factors are obtained about 20% accuracy at @xmath101 .
it is not sufficient to distinguish these models at this moment .
improvements of the ( sm - like ) higgs boson coupling measurements at the hl - lhc and also at the ilc may resolve model predictions .
we here discuss complementarity of precision measurements of the coupling constants of the discovered higgs boson @xmath39 and direct searches of additional higgs bosons at the lhc .
in addition , we also discuss the importance of direct searches of additional higgs bosons at the ilc .
a key role is taken by the deviation in the coupling constant of @xmath39 to weak gauge bosons from the sm prediction , @xmath102 . when non - zero @xmath103 is found at future colliders , that is identified as an evidence of non - standard effects mainly due to additional higgs bosons . by combining the theoretical constraints from perturbative unitarity and vacuum stability
, we obtain the upper limit of the energy scale where an evidence of non - standard higgs sectors should appear .
we first discuss the complementarity in the thdms , and then in the other models later .    for @xmath104 , which is the expected accuracy at the lhc with 300  fb@xmath105  @xcite , @xmath106 should be less than about 700  gev from the conditions of perturbative unitarity and vacuum stability under the assumptions of @xmath107 with varying @xmath35 and @xmath108 in the @xmath109  gev range .
in such a case , it is expected that the lhc direct search can find an evidence of additional higgs bosons simultaneously . for @xmath110  gev , direct production at the ilc experiment with @xmath111  tev will also be useful to explore the properties of additional higgs bosons  @xcite . on top of above , the precision measurement of the couplings of @xmath39 at the ilc will be the most powerful tool to discriminate types of yukawa interaction as shown in figs .
[ fig : kfkfm ] and [ fig : kfkfp ] .    for @xmath112 , which is the expected accuracy at the ilc with @xmath113  gev and @xmath114  fb@xmath105  @xcite , @xmath106 should be less than 1  tev from the conditions of perturbative unitarity and vacuum stability under the assumptions of @xmath107 with varying @xmath35 and @xmath108 in the @xmath109  gev range .
in such a case , there is a possibility that the direct search at the lhc can not find any evidence of additional higgs bosons . in other words ,
the lhc direct search combined with the constraints from perturbative unitarity and vacuum stability can not exclude the extended higgs sector which predicts @xmath115 . at the ilc , at least the precision measurement of the couplings of @xmath39
can indicate an evidence of the extended higgs sector .
even in such a situation , as we have shown in the last section , the model discrimination and parameter determination will be still possible by utilizing only the fingerprinting of the deviation of the couplings of @xmath39 .
furthermore , an upper limit of the mass scale of additional higgs bosons can be set by the constraints from perturbative unitarity and vacuum stability , while the lower limit is given by the direct search at the lhc .
therefore , we could conclude the existence of the non - standard higgs sector at a certain energy scale .
this energy scale will be a crucial information to design next generation future colliders .
the accuracy of @xmath103 measurement can be improved at the ilc with 1  tev and 1  ab@xmath105 , and the indirect upper limit of the mass scale can be slightly extended accordingly . for @xmath116 , which is beyond the accuracy of the coupling measurement of @xmath39 at the ilc with @xmath111  tev and @xmath117  ab@xmath105  @xcite , the upper limit of the mass scale can not be obtained from the conditions of perturbative unitarity and vacuum stability . in this case , we can not separate the extended higgs sector from the sm from the coupling measurements of @xmath39 . therefore , the decoupling limit of the extended higgs sector can not be excluded .
there are possibilities that the additional higgs bosons can be discovered at the lhc or the ilc , since the small deviation in @xmath89 does not necessarily mean the large mass of additional higgs bosons in the extended higgs sector .
we note that the direct production of additional higgs bosons at the lhc and the ilc also have a power to discriminate the models of extended higgs sectors , such as the type of yukawa sector in the thdms  @xcite etc .    in order to compare the precisely measured values of the higgs boson couplings , precise calculations in each given model are essentially important .
one - loop corrections to the @xmath37 coupling constants have been calculated in ref .
@xcite , and those to @xmath38 coupling constants have been calculated in ref .
@xcite in the thdm .
magnitudes of these corrections due to the additional higgs boson loops are respectively given to be maximally about @xmath118 and @xmath119 for the @xmath37 and @xmath38 couplings under the constraint from perturbative unitarity and vacuum stability .
therefore , the pattern of the deviations in the @xmath38 shown in figs .
[ fig : kfkfm ] and [ fig : kfkfp ] does not change even including radiative corrections .
however , if the @xmath38 couplings are determined with an order of 1% accuracy under the situation where the deviation in @xmath37 couplings are also found , we may be able to determine not only the type of yukawa interactions but also some inner parameters such as @xmath120 in the thdms .
in addition to the @xmath37 and @xmath38 couplings , one - loop corrections to the @xmath121 coupling is also important whose amount can be significant due to non - decoupling effect of the additional higgs bosons . in ref .
@xcite , it has been shown that the size of correction can be @xmath122 under the constraint from perturbative unitarity  @xcite and vacuum stability  @xcite . by studying the correlation among the deviations in the @xmath121  @xcite , @xmath123  @xcite and @xmath124  @xcite couplings from the sm predictions , we can extract properties of additional higgs bosons running in the loop such as the electric charge , the isospin and the non - decoupling nature .    finally , we mention models other than the thdms . in the doublet - singlet model  @xcite , both the @xmath37 and @xmath38 coupling constants
are suppressed by the same factor .
therefore , @xmath125 can be an indirect evidence for this model .
detection of an additional cp - even scalar boson , whose yukawa and gauge interactions are given only from the mixing with the doublet higgs field , can be a direct search for the model .
the gm model  @xcite and the doublet - septet model  @xcite have a unique pattern of the deviation in the higgs boson couplings ; namely , @xmath126 can be larger than unity  @xcite , which is a crucial property to identify these models .
in addition , multi - charged ; e.g. , doubly - charged , higgs bosons can significantly contribute to the deviation in the loop induced @xmath123 and @xmath124 couplings .
when multi - charged scalar bosons are discovered , it can be a direct test of these models .
phenomenology of such additional scalar bosons has been discussed in the gm model  @xcite and in the doublet - septet model  @xcite at the lhc .
measuring the @xmath127 vertex  @xcite is also an important probe as discussed in subsection ii c.    in this paper , we concentrate on the models with @xmath36 . however , we here shortly comment on the higgs triplet model ( htm ) as an important example for models with @xmath26 , because it is deduced from the type - ii seesaw mechanism  @xcite . in the htm , although deviations in the @xmath37 and @xmath38 couplings can not be so large due to the constraint from the rho parameter , those in the loop induced @xmath123  @xcite and @xmath124  @xcite couplings can be significant by the doubly - charged higgs boson @xmath128 loop .
the one - loop corrections to the @xmath121 coupling can also be large as calculated in refs .
@xcite due to the non - decoupling effect of additional higgs bosons similarly to the thdm .
the correlation among the deviations in the decay rate of @xmath129 and the @xmath121 coupling constants coupling at the tree level is much suppressed by the triplet vev similar to the @xmath37 and @xmath38 as mentioned in the above .

direct search for @xmath128 can be an important clue to test the model with the @xmath25 triplet field , which can decay into the same - sign dilepton  @xcite and the same - sign diboson  @xcite depending on the magnitude of the triplet vev and the singly - charged scalar components , the cascade decay of @xmath128 associated with the @xmath1 boson is possible  @xcite . ] .
we have discussed the determination of the extended higgs sector by combining the direct and indirect searches for additional higgs bosons at future collider experiments .
direct searches of the additional higgs bosons provides the clear evidence for extended higgs sectors .
focusing on the thdm with the softly - broken @xmath0 symmetry , we have studied the expected exclusion regions in the @xmath106-@xmath130 plane at the lhc with 14  tev run with 300 fb@xmath105 and 3000 fb@xmath105 data . for the neutral higgs boson searches
, we have shown that the mass scale up to several hundreds gev to tev can be explored at the lhc , depending on the type of yukawa interaction and parameters such as @xmath130 and @xmath68 .
for the indirect searches of additional higgs bosons via coupling constants of the sm - like higgs bosons , we have considered various models for the extended higgs sector , such as the thdms with four types of yukawa interactions , the doublet - singlet model , the doublet - septet model , and the gm model , as typical models which predict @xmath36 .
we have demonstrated that there exists a variety of patterns in the deviations in the sm - like higgs boson couplings to the gauge bosons and fermions from the sm prediction depending on the structure of the higgs sector .
therefore , we can fingerprint the non - minimal higgs sector by detecting the pattern of deviations in an excellent precision at future colliders .    taking into account the theoretical constraints on the model , such as perturbative unitarity and vacuum stability ,
the complementarity between the direct searches and the indirect searches can be understood to identify the non - minimal higgs sector .
observation of the deviation in the coupling constant of the sm - like higgs boson to the weak gauge bosons plays a key role , which also affects the strategy of the direct search of additional higgs bosons at colliders .
first of all , we have to keep in mind that there exists a decoupling limit in extended higgs sectors in the limit of @xmath131 , where the sm is a good description as a low energy effective theory up to much higher scales than the electroweak scale .
on the other hand , if a relatively large deviation of @xmath103 is observed , the mass scale of the additional higgs bosons is bounded from the above by using the argument of perturbative unitarity and vacuum stability , so that the direct discovery of them can be highly expected .
if a small deviation is observed at the ilc , the direct discovery of the additional higgs boson can be difficult .
even in such a situation , the fingerprinting of the sm - like higgs boson couplings can be a solid and powerful tool to explore the extended higgs sector .

ning , arxiv:1404.5207 [ hep - ph ] ." ," after the discovery of the standard - model - like higgs boson at the lhc , the structure of the higgs sector remains unknown . 
 we discuss how it can be determined by the combination of direct and indirect searches for additional higgs bosons at future collider experiments . 
 first of all , we evaluate expected excluded regions for the mass of additional neutral higgs bosons from direct searches at the lhc with the 14 tev collision energy in the two higgs doublet models with a softly - broken @xmath0 symmetry . 
 second , precision measurements of the higgs boson couplings at future experiments can be used for the indirect search of extended higgs sectors if measured coupling constant with the gauge boson slightly deviates from the standard model value . in particular , 
 in the two higgs doublet model with the softly - broken discrete symmetry , there are four types of yukawa interactions , so that they can be discriminated by measuring the pattern of deviations in yukawa coupling constants . 
 furthermore , we can fingerprint various extended higgs sectors with future precision data by detecting the pattern of deviations in the coupling constants of the standard - model - like higgs boson . 
 we demonstrate how the pattern of deviations can be different among various higgs sectors which predict the electroweak rho parameter to be unity ; such as models with additional an isospin singlet , a doublet , triplets or a septet . we conclude that as long as the gauge coupling constant of the higgs boson slightly differs from the standard model prediction but is enough to be detected at the lhc and its high - luminosity run or at the international linear collider , we can identify the non - minimal higgs sector even without direct discovery of additional higgs bosons at the lhc . "
"almost forty five years ago feynman , kislinger , and ravndal noticed  @xcite that the regge spectrum of meson and baryon masses could be universally described by assuming the four - dimensional harmonic oscillator potential acting between quarks and antiquarks . during subsequent years
the idea of four - dimensional harmonic oscillator re - entered the discussion about quark confinement several times in various ways .
leutwyler and stern developed the formalism devoted to the covariant description of bilocal meson - like fields @xmath3 combined with the idea of harmonic confinement  @xcite .
considerations of paper  @xcite and leutwyler - stern formalism  @xcite can be seen as the forerunners to at present time very popular soft wall ads / qcd models  @xcite and the light front holographic qcd  @xcite . in recent years , the approaches to confinement based on the ideas of soft wall ads / qcd model and light front holography demonstrated an impressive phenomenological success  @xcite .
the crucial for phenomenology features of these approaches are the particular dilaton profile @xmath4 and the harmonic oscillator form of the confining potential as the function of fifth coordinate @xmath5 .
all these approaches begin with different motivation but finally come to the schrdinger type differential equation with the harmonic potential in @xmath5 defining the wave functions and mass spectrum of mesons and baryons .    the physical origin of the above - mentioned particular form of dilaton profile in ads / qcd and light front holography as well as the harmonic potential in the stern - leutwyler studies and , hence , the laguerre polynomial form of the meson wave functions , could not be identified within these approaches themselves .
the preferable form of the dilaton profile and/or the potential are determined by the phenomenological requirement of regge character of the excited meson mass spectrum  @xcite .
the approach presented in this paper has been developed in essence twenty years ago  @xcite .
it clearly incorporates the idea of harmonic confinement both in terms of elementary color charged fields and the composite colorless hadron field .
the distinctive feature of the present approach is that it basically links the concept of harmonic confinement and regge character of hadron mass spectrum to the specific class of nonperturbative gluon configurations  almost everywhere homogeneous abelian ( anti-)self - dual gluon fields .
a posteriori a close interrelation of the abelian ( anti-)self - dual fields and the hadronization based on harmonic confinement can be read off the papers  @xcite . in brief , the line of arguments is as follows ( for more detailed exposition see  @xcite ) .
an important benchmark has been the observation of pagels and tomboulis  @xcite that abelian self - dual fields describe a medium infinitely stiff to small gauge field fluctuations , i.e. the wave solutions for the effective quantum equations of motion are absent .
this feature was interpreted as suggestive of confinement of color .
strong argumentation in favour of the abelian ( anti-)self - dual homogeneous field as a candidate for the global nontrivial minimum of the effective action originates from the papers @xcite .
in particular , leutwyler has shown that the constant gauge field is stable ( tachyon free ) against small quantum fluctuations only if it is abelian ( anti-)self - dual covariantly constant field @xcite .
nonperturbative calculation of the effective potential within the functional renormalization group @xcite supported the earlier one - loop results on existence of the nontrivial minimum of the effective action for the abelian ( anti-)self - dual field .
the eigenvalues of the dirac and klein - gordon operators in the presence of abelian self - dual field are purely discrete , and the corresponding eigenfunctions of quarks and gluons are of the bound state type .
this is a consequence of the fact that these operators contain the four - dimensional harmonic oscillator , acting as a confining harmonic potential .
eigenmodes of the color charged fields have no ( quasi-)particle interpretation but describe field fluctuations decaying in space and time .
the consequence of this property is that the momentum representation of the translation invariant part of the propagator of the color charged field in the background of ( anti-)self - dual abelian gauge field is entire analytical function .
the absence of pole in the propagator was treated as the absence of the particle interpretation of the charged field  @xcite .
however just the absence of a single quark or anti - quark in the spectrum can not be considered as sufficient condition for confinement .
one has to explain the most peculiar feature of qcd  the regge character of the physical spectrum of colorless hadrons .
usually regge spectrum is related to the string picture of confinement , justified in two complementary ways and limits : classical relativistic rotating string connecting massless quark and antiquark , and the linear potential between nonrelativistic heavy quark and antiquark with the area law for the temporal wilson loop as a relevant criterion for static quark confinement . neither the homogeneous abelian ( anti-)self - dual field itself nor the form of gluon propagator in the presence of this background had the clue to linear quark - antiquark potential . nevertheless , the analytic structure of the gluon and quark propagators and assumption about the randomness of the background field ensemble led both to the area law for static quarks and the regge spectrum for light hadrons .
randomness of the ensemble of almost everywhere homogeneous abelian ( anti-)self - dual gluon fields has been taken into account implicitly in the model of hadronization developed in  @xcite _ via _ averaging of the quark loops over the parameters of the random fields .
the nonlocal quark - meson vertices with the complete set of meson quantum numbers were determined in this model by the form of the color charged gluon propagator .
the spectrum of mesons displayed the regge character both with respect to total angular momentum and radial quantum number of the meson .
the reason for confinement of a single quark and regge spectrum of mesons turned out to be the same  the analytic properties of quark and gluon propagators .    this result has almost completed the quark confinement picture based on the random almost everywhere homogeneous abelian ( anti-)self - dual fields .
self - duality of the fields plays the crucial role in this picture .
this random field ensemble represents a medium where the color charged elementary excitations exist as quickly decaying in space and time field fluctuations but the collective colorless excitations ( mesons ) can propagate as plain waves ( particles ) .
it should be stressed that in this formalism any meson looks much more like a complicated collective excitation of a medium ( qcd vacuum ) involving quark , antiquark and gluon fields than a nonrelativistic quantum mechanical bound state of charged particles ( quark and anti - quark ) due to some potential interaction between them . within this relativistic quantum field description the regge spectrum of color neutral collective modes appeared as a `` medium effect '' as well as the suppression ( confinement ) of a color charged elementary modes .
however , besides this dynamical color charge confinement , a correct complete picture must include the limit of static quark - antiquark pair with the area law for the temporal wilson loop . in order to explore this aspect an explicit construction of the random domain ensemble
was suggested in paper  @xcite , and the area law for the wilson loop was demonstrated by the explicit calculation .
randomness of the ensemble ( in line with @xcite ) and ( anti-)self - duality of the fields are crucial for this result .    in this paper
we briefly review the approach to confinement , chiral symmetry realization and bosonization based on the representation of qcd vacuum in terms of the statistical ensemble of almost everywhere homogeneous abelian ( anti-)self - dual gluon fields , systematically calculate the spectrum of radial meson excitations and their decay constants and outline the possible relation between the formalism of soft wall ads / qcd and light - front holography , and this , at first sight , different approach .
the character of meson wave functions in hadronization approach  @xcite is fixed by the form of the gluon propagator in the background of the specific class of vacuum gluon configurations .
these wave functions are almost identical to the wave functions of the soft wall ads / qcd with quadratic dilaton profile and leutwyler - stern formalism . in all three cases
we are dealing with the generalized laguerre polynomials as the functions of @xmath5 . in the hadronization approach of @xcite and
@xcite the fifth coordinate @xmath5 appears as the relative distance between quark and antiquark in the center of quark mass coordinate system , while the center of mass coordinate @xmath6 represents the space - time point where the meson field is localized .
this treatment of coordinates goes in line with the leutwyler - stern approach .
comparison of the soft wall ads / qcd action and the effective action for auxiliary bilocal meson - like fields of the hadronization approach hints at the link between very appearance of dilaton and its particular profile and the form of nonperturbative gluon propagator .
the strictly quadratic in @xmath5 dilaton profile corresponds to the propagator in the presence of strictly homogeneous ( anti-)self - dual abelian gluon field that is an idealization of the domain wall network background with infinitely thin domain walls .
these three approaches can be considered as complementary to each other ways to describe confinement in terms of meson wave functions . however , unlike two other approaches bosonization in the background of domain wall networks relates the form of meson wave functions to the particular vacuum structure of qcd and provides one with the manifestly defined meson effective action that describes strong , electromagnetic and weak interactions of mesons in terms of nonlocal vertices given by the quark - gluon loops .
new results for mass spectrum and decay constants of radially excited light , heavy - light mesons and heavy quarkonia are presented .
an overall accuracy of description is 10 - 15 percent in the lowest order calculation achieved with the minimal for qcd set of parameters : infrared limits of renormalized strong coupling constant @xmath7 and quark masses @xmath8 , scalar gluon condensate @xmath9 as a fundamental scale of qcd and topological susceptibility of pure qcd without quarks .
this last parameter can be related to the mean size of domains .
it should be noted that the present paper also completes and clarifies the studies of @xcite in two important respects : diagonalization of the quadratic part of the meson effective action with respect to radial quantum number , clarification of the physical meaning of the quark mass parameters in the context of the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking by the background field and four - fermion interaction .
the paper is organized as follows .
section [ section_domain_wall_network_as_vacuum ] is devoted to motivation of the approach .
derivation of the effective meson action is considered in section [ section_domain_model ] .
results for the masses , transition and decay constants of various mesons are presented in section [ section_masses_of_mesons ] . in the section [ discussion ] we outline possible relation between the present hadronization approach and the formalism of the soft wall ads / qcd model , light front holographic qcd ,
compare the quark and gluon propagators of the present approach with the results of functional renormalization group ( frg ) and dyson - schwinger equations ( dse ) .
important technical details are given in the appendices .
the primary phenomenological basis of the present approach is the existence of nonzero condensates in qcd , first of all  the scalar gluon condensate @xmath9 . in order to incorporate this condensate into the functional integral approach to quantization of qcd one
has to choose appropriate conditions for the functional space of gluon fields @xmath10 to be integrated over ( see , e.g. , ref.@xcite ) . besides the formal mathematical content
, these conditions play the role of substantial physical input which , together with the classical action of qcd , complements the statement of the quantization problem . in other words , starting with the very basic representation of the euclidean functional integral for qcd , @xmath11\},\ ] ] one has to specify integration spaces @xmath12 for gluon and @xmath13 for quark fields .
bearing in mind a nontrivial qcd vacuum structure encoded in various condensates , one have to define @xmath12 permitting gluon fields with nonzero classical action density , @xmath14 it is assumed that the constant @xmath15 may have a nonzero value .
the gauge fields @xmath16 that satisfy this condition have a potential to provide the vacuum with the whole variety of condensates .
an analytical approach to definition and calculation of the functional integral can be based on separation of modes @xmath17 responsible for nonzero condensates from the small perturbations @xmath18 .
this separation must be supplemented with gauge fixing .
background gauge fixing condition @xmath19 is the most natural choice . to perform separation ,
one inserts identity @xmath20\int\limits_{{\cal q } } dq\int\limits_{\omega}d\omega \delta[a^\omega - q^\omega - b^\omega ]   \delta[d(b^\omega)q^\omega]\ ] ] in the functional integral and arrives at @xmath21 \delta[\mathcal{d}(b)q]e^{-s_{\rm qcd}[b+q,\psi , \bar\psi]}\\ & = & \int\limits_\mathcal{b}db \exp\{-s_\mathrm{eff}[b]\}.\end{aligned}\ ] ] thus defined quantum effective action @xmath22 $ ] has a physical meaning of the free energy of the quantum field system in the presence of the background gluon field @xmath23 . in the limit @xmath24 global minima of @xmath22 $ ]
determine the class of gauge field configurations representing the equilibrium state ( vacuum ) of the system .
quite reliable argumentation in favour of ( almost everywhere ) homogeneous abelian ( anti-)self - dual fields as dominating vacuum configurations was put forward by many authors  @xcite . as it has already been mentioned in introduction , nonperturbative calculation of qcd quantum effective action within the functional renormalization group approach @xcite supported the one - loop result @xcite and indicated the existence of a minimum of the effective potential for nonzero value of abelian ( anti-)self - dual homogeneous gluon field .     between chromomagnetic and chromoelectric field and the mixing angle @xmath25 in the cartan subalgebra .
the minima in the dark gray regions correspond to the abelian ( anti-)self - dual configurations and form a periodic structure labelled by integer indices @xmath26 in eq .
( for more details see @xcite).[effpotxiomega],scaledwidth=35.0% ]    ginzburg - landau ( gl ) approach to the quantum effective action indicated a possibility of the domain wall network formation in qcd vacuum resulting in the dominating vacuum gluon configuration seen as an ensemble of densely packed lumps of covariantly constant abelian ( anti-)self - dual field @xcite .
nonzero scalar gluon condensate @xmath27 postulated by the effective potential @xmath28 with @xmath29 being a scale of qcd and @xmath30 , leads to the existence of twelve discrete degenerate global minima of the effective action ( see fig.[effpotxiomega ] ) , @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 correspond to the self - dual and anti - self - dual field respectively , matrix @xmath34 belongs to cartan subalgebra of @xmath35 with six values of the angle @xmath36 corresponding to the boundaries of the weyl chambers in the root space of @xmath35 .
the minima are connected by the parity and weyl group reflections .
their existence indicates that the system is prone to the domain wall formation . to demonstrate the simplest example of domain wall interpolating between the self - dual and anti - self - dual abelian configurations , one allows the angle @xmath37 between chromomagnetic and chromoelectric fields to vary from point to point in @xmath38 and restricts other degrees of freedom of gluon field to their vacuum values . in this case
ginsburg - landau lagrangian leads to the sine - gordon equation for @xmath37 with the standard kink solution ( for details see ref .
@xcite ) @xmath39    away from the kink location vacuum field is almost self - dual ( @xmath40 ) or anti - self - dual ( @xmath41 ) .
exactly at the wall it becomes purely chromomagnetic ( @xmath42 ) .
domain wall network is constructed by means of the kink superposition . in general kink
can be parametrized as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is inverse width of the kink , @xmath45 is a normal to the wall and @xmath46 are coordinates of the wall .
a single lump in two , three and four dimensions is given by @xmath47 for @xmath48 , respectively .
the general kink network is then given by the additive superposition of lumps @xmath49 topological charge density distribution for a network of domain walls with different width is illustrated in fig.[cubes ] .
based on this construction , the measure of integration over the background field @xmath17 can be constructively represented as the infinite dimensional ( in the infinite volume ) integral over the parameters of @xmath50 domain walls in the network : their positions , orientations and widths , with the weight determined by the effective action .
it should be noted that chronologically the explicit construction of the domain wall network is the most recent development of the formalism that have been studied in the series of papers @xcite , in which the domain wall defects in the homogeneous abelian ( anti-)self - dual field were taken into account either implicitly or in an explicit but simplified form with the spherical domains .
the practical calculations in the next sections will be done within combined implementation of domain model given in paper  @xcite : propagators in the quark loops are taken in the approximation of the homogeneous background field and the quark loops are averaged over the background field , the correlators of the background field are calculated in the spherical domain approximation .    .
the leftmost picture is an example of confining almost everywhere homogeneous abelian ( anti-)self - dual fields .
red ( blue ) color corresponds to the self - dual field ( anti - self - dual ) , green  pure chromomagnetic field .
the rightmost plot represents the case of preferably pure chromomagnetic field when the topological charge density is nearly zero and color charged quasiparticles can be excited thus indicating deconfinement ( for more details see @xcite).[cubes ] ]
the haronization formalism based on domain model of qcd vacuum was elaborated in the series of papers @xcite .
we refer to these papers for most of the technical details omitted in this brief presentation .
it has been shown that the model embraces static ( area law ) and dynamical quark confinement ( propagators in momentum representation are entire analytical functions ) as well as spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry by the background domain structured field itself .
@xmath1 problem was resolved without introducing the strong cp - violation  @xcite .
estimation of masses of light , heavy - light mesons and heavy quarkonia along with their orbital excitations @xcite demonstrated promising phenomenological performance .
however , calculations in refs .
@xcite have been done neglecting a mixing between radially excited meson fields .
below we present results of calculation refined in this respect .    in the spherical domain approximation ,
the background gluon fields are represented by the ensemble of domain - structured fields with the strength tensor @xcite @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the space - time coordinate of the @xmath53-th domain center , scale @xmath29 and mean domain radius @xmath54 are parameters of the model related to the scalar gluon condensate and topological susceptibility of pure yang - mills vacuum , respectively  @xcite .
the measure of integration over ensemble of background fields is defined as  @xcite @xmath55    once the measure is specified , one can return to the functional integral and integrate out fluctuation part of the gluon fields @xmath56 : @xmath57 \delta_{\rm fp}[b , q ] e^ { - s^{\rm qcd}\left[q+ b,\psi,\bar\psi \right ] } \\ & = & \int db \int_{\psi}{\cal d}\psi { \cal d}\bar \psi \exp\left\{\int dx \bar\psi\left(i \hspace*{-0.2em } \not{\hspace*{-0.2em}\partial } + g\hspace*{-0.3em}\not{\hspace*{-0.3em}b}-m\right)\psi\right\ } w[j],\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath58 is the local quark current .
recalling the definition of green functions , @xmath59}{\delta j^{a_1}_{\mu_1}(x_1)\dots \delta j^{a_n}_{\mu_n}(x_n ) } \right\lvert_{j=0},\ ] ] we arrive at the representation @xmath60&=&\exp\left\{\sum_n \frac{g^n}{n!}\int d^4x_1\dots \int d^4x_n j^{a_1}_{\mu_1}(x_1)\dots j^{a_n}_{\mu_n}(x_n ) g^{a_1\dots a_n}_{\mu_1\dots \mu_n}(x_1,\dots , x_n|b)\right\},\end{aligned}\ ] ] where by construction the gauge coupling constant @xmath7 and the exact renormalized @xmath2-point gluon green functions of pure gauge theory in the presence of the background field @xmath15 appear to be renormalized within appropriate renormalization scheme
. it is needless to say that the functional form of these green functions , gluon propagator in particular , has been a subject of many investigations carried out over decades .
quite reliable information about two- and three - point euclidean green functions was obtained within the functional renormalization group , lattice qcd as well as calculations based on dyson - schwinger equations .    at this step
one has to set up the approximation scheme .
we truncate the exponent in @xmath61 $ ] up to the four - fermion interaction term .
interaction between standard local color charged quark currents is described by the product of the renormalized coupling constant squared and exact gluon propagator @xmath62 which will be approximated by the gluon propagator in the presence of homogeneous abelian ( anti-)self - dual field .
radiative corrections due to the gluon and ghost field fluctuations are neglected ( for more details see refs .
it should be noted that omitted radiative corrections can be represented in terms of the standard for pure gluodynamics set of feynman graphs for gluon polarization function but the internal lines in the graphs correspond to the gluon and ghost propagators in the background field @xmath15 . in other words ,
the approximation in use corresponds to the lowest ( tree level ) order with respect to perturbative fluctuations @xmath56 , but the background field ( vacuum field @xmath15 ) itself is taken into account exactly .
the randomness of domain ensemble is taken into account implicitly by means of averaging the nonlocal meson - meson interaction vertices over all possible configurations of the homogeneous background field at the final stage of derivation of the effective meson action  @xcite .
relevant truncated part of qcd functional integral reads @xmath63 where @xmath64 is a diagonal quark mass matrix . by means of the standard fierz transformation of color , dirac and flavour matrices
the four - quark interaction can be rewritten as @xmath65 where numerical coefficients @xmath66 are different for different spin - parity @xmath67 . here
bilocal color neutral quark currents , @xmath68 are singlets with respect to the local background gauge transformations . in the center of quark mass coordinate system
bilocal currents take the form @xmath69 and their interaction is described by the action  @xcite @xmath70    where @xmath71 - center of quark mass coordinates , and @xmath72 - relative coordinates of quark and antiquark .
it has to be noted here that quark fields are seen as pure fluctuations describable in terms of four - dimentional harmonic oscillator eigenmodes of the bound state type  @xcite in @xmath38 .
interpretation of the quark field in terms of point - like particle is simply does not exist in the confining background under consideration .
function @xmath73 originates from the gluon propagator in the presence of the homogeneous abelian ( anti-)self - dual gluon field  @xcite .
it differs from the free massless scalar propagator by the gaussian exponent , which completely changes the ir properties of the propagator but leaves its uv asymptotic behaviour unchanged . in momentum representation
it takes the form @xmath74 it is important that nonzero gluon condensates @xmath9 and @xmath75 represented by the abelian ( anti-)self - dual vacuum field remove the pole from the propagator which can be treated as dynamical confinement of the color charged fields  @xcite .
, title='fig : ' ] + , title='fig : ' ]    the quark propagator in the homogeneous as well as domain structured  @xcite abelian ( anti-)self - dual gluon field also demonstrates confinement .
momentum representation @xmath76 of the translation invariant part of the quark propagator in the presence of the homogeneous field , @xmath77 is an entire analytical function of momentum : @xmath78,\\ f_{\alpha\beta}=\frac{\hat{n}}{2v\lambda^2}b_{\alpha\beta } , \
v = \mathrm{diag}\left(\frac16,\frac16,\frac13\right ) , \ \
\hat{b}_{\rho\mu}\hat{b}_{\rho\nu}=4 v^2\lambda^4\delta_{\mu\nu}. \nonumber\end{aligned}\ ] ]    the propagator has a rich dirac structure including not only the vector and scalar parts but also the pseudoscalar , axial vector and tensor terms ( flavour index @xmath79 is omitted for the sake of brevity ) @xmath80 here `` @xmath81 '' corresponds to self - dual and anti - self - dual background field configurations .
one can easily reconstruct explicit form of functions @xmath82 from eq .. more detailed description of different form factors , particularly the scalar one , and their role in the chiral symmetry realization will be given in section  [ discussion ] .
this structure of the quark propagator plays important role for successful description of the meson spectrum , especially for the ground state light mesons .
@ccccccc@ @xmath83 , mev&@xmath84 , mev&@xmath85 , mev&@xmath86 , mev&@xmath29 , mev&@xmath87&@xmath54 , fm + @xmath88&@xmath89&@xmath90&@xmath91&@xmath92&@xmath93&@xmath94 +    [ values_of_parameters ]    there are two equivalent ways to derive effective meson action based on the functional integral with the interaction term @xmath95 taken in the form  .
the first one is bosonization of the functional integral in terms of bilocal meson - like fields ( see for example ref .
we shall return to this option in the discussion section .
another , more elucidative way is to decompose the bilocal currents over complete set of functions @xmath96 orthogonal with the weight determined by function @xmath73 originating from the gluon propagator in eq . @xmath97 here @xmath2 is the radial quantum number and @xmath98 is the orbital momentum .
coefficient quark currents @xmath99 have to describe intrinsic structure of the collective meson - like excitations with complete set of quantum numbers .
the form of interaction   and natural requirement of diagonality ( with respect to @xmath2 and @xmath98 ) of the four - quark interaction , expressed in terms of the currents @xmath99 , indicate the choice of @xmath100 @xmath101 here @xmath102 are irreducible tensors of four - dimensional rotational group , and generalized laguerre polynomials @xmath103 obey relation @xmath104    the weight @xmath105 comes from the gluon propagator  .
nonlocal quark currents @xmath106 with complete set of meson quantum numbers can be explicitly calculated and depend only on the center of mass coordinate @xmath6  @xcite , @xmath107 where @xmath108 and @xmath109 are flavour @xmath110 and dirac matrices respectively .
the four - fermion interaction takes the form of an infinite sum of the current - current interactions diagonal with respect to all quantum numbers @xmath111 it has to be stressed that the nonlocal quark currents are invariant with respect to the local gauge transformations of the background gauge field as the vertices depend on the covariant derivatives .
the truncated qcd functional integral can be rewritten in terms of the composite colorless meson fields @xmath112 by means of the standard bosonization procedure : introduce the auxiliary meson fields , integrate out the quark fields , perform the orthogonal transformation of the auxiliary fields that diagonalizes the quadratic part of the action and , finally , rescale the meson fields to provide the correct residue of the meson propagator at the pole corresponding to its physical mass ( if any ) .
more details can be found in ref .
the result can be written in the following compact form @xmath113\right\ } , \label{meson_pf}\\ & & w_k[\phi]= \sum\limits_{{\cal q}_1\dots{\cal q}_k}h_{{\cal q}_1}\dots h_{{\cal q}_k } \int d^4x_1\dots\int d^4x_k \phi_{{\cal q}_1}(x_1)\dots \phi_{{\cal q}_k}(x_k ) \gamma^{(k)}_{{\cal q}_1\dots{\cal q}_k}(x_1,\dots , x_k ) , \label{effective_meson_action } \\   & & \phi_{{\cal q}}(x)=\int \frac{d^4p}{(2\pi)^4}e^{ipx}{\mathcal o}_{{\mathcal q}{\mathcal q}'}(p)\tilde\phi_{{\mathcal q}'}(p ) ,   \label{pphi}\end{aligned}\ ] ] where condensed index @xmath114 denotes all relevant meson quantum numbers and indices .
integration variables @xmath115 in the functional integral correspond to the physical meson fields that diagonalize the quadratic part of the effective meson action in momentum representation , which is achieved by means of orthogonal transformation @xmath116 .
interactions between physical meson fields @xmath115 are described by @xmath53-point nonlocal vertices @xmath117 , @xmath118 subsequently tuned to the physical meson representation by means of corresponding orthogonal transformations @xmath116 .
vertices @xmath119 are expressed _ via _
1-loop diagrams @xmath120 which include nonlocal quark - meson vertices and quark propagators : @xmath121 @xmath122 bar denotes integration over all configurations of the background fields . as it is illustrated in fig.[diagrams ] , vertex functions @xmath119 include , in general , several one - loop diagrams correlated via the background field . in the simplified model of spherical domains , the @xmath2-point correlator @xmath123 is given by a volume of overlap of @xmath2 four - dimensional hyperspheres  @xcite .
it has to be noted that though all dirac structures , besides the vector and scalar ones , are nullified by the integration of the propagator over the background field , all of them give highly nontrivial contribution to the quark loops ( products of several propagators ) .
for example , the two - point correlators responsible for the mass spectrum contain not only the one gluon ( fluctuation @xmath56 ! ) exchange interaction hidden in the vertex @xmath124 but also additional @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath16 and @xmath128 interactions effectively generated by the background gluon field @xmath15 .
it has to be stressed that the terms linear in meson fields are absent in .
the linear terms naturally vanish for all mesons besides the scalar ones , and their elimination for the scalar fields requires solution of an infinite system of equations @xmath129 where @xmath130 and @xmath131 can be treated as an infinite set of scalar quark condensates labelled by the radial quantum number @xmath2 . as we shall discuss in section  [ discussion ] , solution of this system of equations leads to the interesting details of the chiral symmetry realization in the presence of the background field under consideration .
actual calculations further below will be done with constant mass which from now on will be treated as the infrared limit of the running nonperturbative quark masses @xmath132 considered as parameters of the model .

solution of eq
.   identifies the position of the pole in the propagator of the meson with quantum numbers @xmath158 .
definition of the meson - quark coupling constant @xmath153 provides correct residue at the pole .
the free parameters of the model are the ir limits of the running renormalized strong coupling constant @xmath87 , quark masses @xmath159 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and the scales @xmath29 and @xmath160 . by construction , the coupling constant and the quark masses correspond to the background feynman gauge condition and momentum subtraction ( mom ) renormalization scheme at subtraction point @xmath161 .
the scale @xmath29 and mean domain size @xmath160 are related to the scalar gluon condensate and topological susceptibility of pure gluodynamics respectively , @xmath162    it should be noted that decomposition and attributes the same radial form factor @xmath163 to the mesons with different spin - parity @xmath164 .
moreover , the form of @xmath163 appears to be the same for all quarkonium - like collective excitations with different quark content and spin - parity such as @xmath137 and @xmath165 mesons . on the contrary ,
the physical meson states correspond to the momentum dependent transformed basis and respectively transformed quark current @xmath166 where @xmath167 is an orthogonal transformation of the initial basis taking into account two - point function @xmath168 .
all this means that though _ ab initio _ the basic property of quark - meson interaction form factor is set up by gluon propagator , it is the quark loop that defines its final physical form which is different for different mesons .

one can see from eq . that expressions for @xmath183 with the same spin but opposite parity differ only in the sign of the function @xmath184 ( second term in square brackets in ) .
this difference has a peculiar consequence for meson spectrum .
real @xmath185 solutions of eq .
for both scalar and axial mesons are absent , while pseudoscalar and vector meson solutions exist irrespective to the quark content of a meson . in the present approach scalar and axial mesons as quark - antiquark
collective excitations analogous to the corresponding pseudoscalar and vector mesons are absent in the spectrum .
however , scalar and axial mesons naturally appear in the hyperfine splitting structures of the orbital excitations of vector mesons  @xcite . for example , @xmath186-meson as a plain analogue of @xmath137-meson is absent .
the reason is that the term in eq .
proportional to the quark masses dominates both in the case of heavy and light quarks . for heavy quarks it dominates just because of their large masses . for the light quarks , due to the contribution of zero modes to the scalar part of quark propagator this term dominates again . as a result , solutions to eq . for scalar and axial states are absent in the whole range of the quark masses . further below
we will not discuss scalar and axial mesons any more .
the study of the spectrum of parity partners in a more detailed and systematic way than the estimates of paper  @xcite has to be done .
it will be presented elsewhere .

the rightmost column demonstrates behaviour of meson masses in the chiral limit as it has been defined in @xcite .
since the quark masses here have the meaning of ir limit of the running effective mass , the appropriate way to turn the system into the chiral limit is to alter the masses of quarks @xmath83 and @xmath84 to the value @xmath224 @xmath225 at which the light pseudoscalar octet mesons become massless . then the current quark masses @xmath226 may be found as differences @xmath227 unlike the current masses themselves , their ratio is renormalization group invariant .
the ratio takes the value @xmath228 that is close to the generally recognized value and just slightly differs from the result of @xcite where diagonalization has been ignored .
it follows from eq . that in the chiral limit a degeneracy emerges , @xmath229 and according to eq . mixing between @xmath196 and @xmath197 disappears .
the two - loop diagram contributes only to the correlator of @xmath196 . as a result ,
@xmath146 meson becomes massless simultaneously with pions and kaons , but the @xmath147 meson stays massive with a slightly reduced mass .
this mechanism provides resolution of the @xmath1 problem as it is seen in terms of @xmath147 mass .

it has to be stressed that there are rigid asymptotic regimes which drive the three regions of meson spectrum  @xcite : chiral symmetry breaking and dynamical quark confinement for the light mesons , proper isgur - wise limit for the case of heavy - light mesons and correct uv behaviour of the gluon and quark propagators combined with the dynamical quark confinement for the heavy quarkonia .

[ weak_decay_diagrams ] ]
in this section we touch on several issues which have not been fully elaborated yet but appear to be very important as they allow one to identify the place of the present approach among other models of confinement , chiral symmetry breakdown and hadronization as well as the methods underlining them .
these are potential interrelations of the present approach to the soft wall ads / qcd models , comparison of the properties of gluon correlator with the landau gauge gluon and quark propagators as they appear in functional renormalization group , schwinger - dyson equations and lattice qcd , as well as details of chiral symmetry realization in the present approach .
some basic properties of these approaches seem to be visible from the viewpoint of the present formalism .
bosonization of the four - quark interaction in terms of bilocal meson - like fields @xmath262 leads to the following quadratic part of the effective action @xmath263 meson eigenfunctions @xmath96 in the decomposition @xmath264 are defined by the action @xmath265 _ via _ corresponding integral equation .
solution of this eigenfunction problem is equivalent to diagonalization of the quadratic part of the effective action in eq .. specific gaussian form of gluon propagator @xmath266 is the reason for the radial part of the wave functions to be represented in terms of the generalized laguerre polynomials , see eq .  .
the mass spectrum has regge character  @xcite .
for the quadratic in @xmath5 dilaton profile @xmath267 soft wall ads / qcd models arrive at the decomposition @xmath268 with the radial meson wave functions proportional to generalized laguerre polynomials , @xmath269 which is a solution of the eigenfunction problem in differential form .
the eigenvalues can be treated as the meson masses squared , and they strictly correspond to regge spectrum for the quadratic in @xmath5 dilaton field .
there are obvious differences between effective action and the soft wall ads / qcd action .
the fifth space - time coordinate @xmath5 of ads / qcd model appears in the present approach as a distance between quark and anti - quark .
there are four @xmath5-coordinates in , and hence the meson wave function contains angular part .
also it is not immediately clear where ads metrics could come from in eq .. apart from this , the feature in common is the gaussian weight function which in both cases plays the most important role for regge character of the mass spectrum . after integrating out @xmath5 coordinate the quadratic part of the effective meson action put on - shell ( that is neglecting terms of order @xmath270 with @xmath271 ) , @xmath272 is equivalent to the effective actions constructed within the ads / qcd models .
one gets an impression that the form of dilaton profile in soft wall ads / qcd approach could be linked to the gluon propagator and thus to the properties of qcd vacuum .
a systematic verification of this conjecture requires derivation of the approximate ( or reduced to some appropriate limit ) differential form of the action .
weight and basis functions of the domain model have to be systematically compared with those employed in soft - wall ads / qcd @xcite and harmonic confinement @xcite approaches .

[ gluon_fig],title='fig:',scaledwidth=30.0% ]      it is interesting to take a look at the properties of gluon and quark correlators in view of the known functional form of quark and landau gauge gluon propagators calculated within the functional renormalization group , lattice qcd and dyson - schwinger equations @xcite . we do not intend to compare the propagators on a detailed quantitative basis if for no other reason than difference in gauge condition . unlike just mentioned studies
, the present approach have assumed background gauge condition so as renormalization of quark - gluon coupling constant is related to the gluon field renormalization .

, one may divide the tree - level propagator by an appropriate logarithm , which , for background gauge , can be attributed to the effective running coupling constant , @xmath275 here the form of logarithmic factor has been chosen to correspond to the form used in @xcite .
the result is shown by the dashed lines in fig.[gluon_fig ] .
one can see that the propagator itself ( lhs ) is not that much affected by taking into account the short distance scaling . on the contrary
, the dressing function is expectedly modified at large @xmath276 ( rhs ) .
the shape of modified by logarithmic scaling gluon correlator is in agreement with the result of _ ab initio _ numerical calculations presented in @xcite and a corresponding part of _ ad - hoc _ postulated input gluon propagator for the quark dse @xcite . in the present set - up
, the bump in the dressing function is due to the explicit @xmath277 factor in the fluctuation gluon field propagator in the presence of the abelian ( anti-)self - dual nonperturbative gluon fields .
this factor is also responsible for the absence of a pole in the propagator which would correspond to the colour charged particles in the spectrum . in the infra - red limit the dressing function behaves as @xmath278 , where scale @xmath29 is exactly the same for the tree level ( solid line ) and uv - corrected ( dashed line ) dressing functions in fig.[gluon_fig ] . in our approach scale @xmath29 , a gluon gap ,
is related to the scalar gluon condensate represented in terms of the abelian ( anti-)self - dual vacuum fields .
it is also notable that identification of this gap with a kind of literally understood gluon mass would be misleading .

qualitative analysis of the scaling properties can be done with regard to the quark propagator .
the tree level propagator takes into account the background abelian ( anti-)self - dual field exactly and completely neglects perturbative radiative corrections . in this approximation
the quark mass has a meaning of the ir limit of the effective running mass .
the propagator has complicated dirac structure which includes the complete set of dirac matrices @xmath283 with corresponding form factors @xmath284 ( @xmath285 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath16 , @xmath128 ) . for the case of constant quark mass @xmath286 functions
@xmath284 and corresponding dressing functions @xmath287 are shown in fig.[quark_dr_spvat_fig ]
. at large euclidean momentum ( short distance ) the scalar and vector dressing functions tend to unity while the rest of functions vanish quickly , and the propagator approaches the free dirac propagator with mass @xmath286 .
if one switches on the momentum dependence of the quark masses and naturally assumes that @xmath288 at large momenta @xmath289 ( we use here dimensionless notation @xmath281 , @xmath290 ) then the following simple asymptotic relations hold @xmath291 it should be stressed here that the first leading terms in above equations have the standard perturbative form while the subleading terms are purely nonperturbative , and they are suppressed by the gaussian exponents .
the squared mass in the denominator of subleading terms in the last three form factors ( @xmath292 ) originate from the zero mode contribution to the propagator .
these terms are also finite since the scaling of the mass to zero value ( in the absence of the current masses ! ) is suppressed by the gaussian factor if @xmath293 at asymptotically large @xmath276 . in the limit @xmath294 various dressing functions @xmath295 of the quark propagator read @xmath296 irrespective to the running of the quark mass .

we see that there are two contributions to the scalar condensate : the vacuum field itself and the four - fermion interaction . thus , due to the abelian ( anti-)self - dual vacuum field the chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken for arbitrarily small four - fermion interaction . for the values of strong coupling
constant and scale given in the table  [ values_of_parameters ] , @xmath312 and @xmath313  mev , one arrives at the estimate @xmath314  mev , which is not that different from the value .
it is also very important that the quark propagator with the running mass of the form remains an entire analytical function in the complex @xmath276 plane , and the dynamical confinement property stays intact .
moreover , the propagator with the running mass decreases both in euclidean and minkowski domains of @xmath276 , as it is illustrated in fig.[quark_dr_spvat_mp_fig ] . similar shape of the scalar and vector form factors was reported in dyson - schwinger approach  @xcite and interpreted in terms of the complex conjugated poles of the quark propagator .
however this is not a unique interpretation , as one may conclude from the present consideration .
the full set of constants @xmath315 , which correspond to the invariant with respect to the local gauge transformation quark condensates @xmath316 , can be obtained by means of complete solution of eq . including heavy flavours .
like equation , in the chiral limit this system of equations is free from divergences , both ultraviolet and infrared ( for discussion of analogous quark condensates see paper  @xcite ) .
complete solution of eq . should allow us to use the current quark masses as free parameters instead of the infrared limit of the nonperturbative constituent masses .
in the present approach , dependence of the light meson masses on radial quantum number @xmath2 and orbital momentum @xmath98 has regge character for @xmath317 or @xmath318 as it has been shown long time ago  @xcite .
the source of regge mass spectrum in the model is the same as the source of dynamical colour confinement 
the impact of the abelian ( anti-)self - dual background fields onto gluon and quark propagators resulting in the absence of singularities in propagators in the whole complex momentum plane .
gaussian exponential dependence of propagators on momentum is of particular importance for the strictly equidistant spectrum of @xmath319 ( see a highly instructive consideration of the toy nonlocal kutkosky model in papers  @xcite ) .
nondiagonal in radial number terms in the quadratic part of the action were neglected in our previous estimations  @xcite .
results of improved computation with proper diagonalisation is given in tables  [ light_mesons ] , [ heavy - light ] , [ heavy ] and [ constants ] .
diagonalization significantly changes the values of parameters of the model but does not affect main features of the model .
the values of parameters given in table [ values_of_parameters ] were fitted to ground state mesons @xmath320 . the rest of masses , decay and transition constants were computed straightforwardly without further tuning of the parameters .
in particular the same strong coupling constant was taken for light , heavy light mesons and heavy quarkonia .
diagonalization in combination with chiral symmetry implementation turned out to be crucial for computation of leptonic decay constants @xmath250 for radially excited states . in comparison with available experimental data
the overall accuracy of the model is about 11 - 15% ( with very few exceptions like @xmath251 for heavy quarkonia ) .    in the discussion section
we have touched on several important issues related to the chiral symmetry implementation , comparison with frg and dse results for propagators , and the interrelation of the present formalism with ads / qcd models .
more systematic study of these problems will be presented elsewhere .

"many recent observational studies have found a population of high - z ( @xmath1 ) , massive ( @xmath2 ) , compact ( @xmath3 ) galaxies ( e.g. daddi et al .
2005 , trujillo et al .
2006 , cimatti et al .
2008 , van dokkum et al .
2008 , saracco et al .
2009 , cassata et al .
2011 and others ) . in the great majority of these studies ,
galaxies are selected to be already passively evolving ( devoid of ongoing star formation ) at the redshift they are observed .
passive galaxies at high - z have been found to display a wide range in sizes , from extremely compact to those whose sizes are comparable to normal galaxies in the local universe ( saracco et al .
2009 , mancini et al .
2010 , cassata et al .
2011 ) .
most high - z works use as local comparison the _ r_-band sloan median mass - size relation for galaxies with sersic index @xmath4 from shen et al .
trujillo et al . ( 2009 ) and taylor et al . ( 2010 ) searched for massive compact galaxies in sloan and both found very few such galaxies in the general field at low redshift .    here
we present a search for massive and compact galaxies in different environments at low redshift using two galaxy samples : for the general field we use the padova millennium galaxy and group catalogue at @xmath5 ( pm2gc , calvi et al .
2011 ) , and for galaxy clusters the wide - field nearby galaxy cluster survey at @xmath6 ( wings , fasano et al .
2006 ) .
`` superdense '' galaxies , with galaxy stellar masses and effective sizes similar to those of high - z galaxies ( @xmath7 ) , were found to represent @xmath8 of all galaxies with @xmath9 in wings clusters based on v - band images ( valentinuzzi et al .
2010 , hereafter v10 ) . given the paucity of similar galaxies in the field studies mentioned above , this suggested a strong environmental dependence in the frequency of massive and compact galaxies at low - z ( v10 ) .
v10 , and a number of other works ( saracco et al .
2011 , cassata et al .
2011 , cappellari et al . 2012 and
these proceedings , to name a few ) also found that galaxy sizes depend on the age of stars : galaxies with older luminosity - weighted ages ( hereafter , lw ages ) are smaller .
as a consequence , selecting the oldest galaxies at high - z ( those that have already stopped forming stars at @xmath1 ) means selecting the most compact ones . at lower redshifts , larger galaxies stop forming stars and enter the passive galaxy samples , causing the median mass - size relation to move to larger radii at fixed mass .
hence , in order to measure the correct amount of size evolution , the sizes of high - z galaxies should be compared only with those of galaxies whose lw age is so old that they were already passive at high - z ( v10 ) .
moreover , in clusters at @xmath10 , superdense galaxies are 40% of the galaxy population , and the mass - size relation in clusters evolves very little between @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( valentinuzzi et al .
recently ( poggianti et al . 2012 , submitted ) , we have searched for massive compact galaxies in the field using the pm2gc , a sample of low - z galaxies representative of the general field population drawn from the millennium galaxy catalogue ( mgc , liske et al .
2003 , driver et al .
we measured galaxy radii and galaxy morphologies with gasphot ( pignatelli & fasano 2006 ) and morphot ( fasano et al . 2012 ) , respectively , from the mgc b - band images .
size and stellar mass estimates are in very good agreement with other existing measurements .    after inspecting each superdense candidate
, we found 44 superdense galaxies out of 995 galaxies in the pm2gc , corresponding to a fraction of 4.4%@xmath13 among galaxies with @xmath14 .
the corresponding fraction in clusters from b - band wings images is 11.8%@xmath15 ( about half of the v - band percentage found by v10 ) .
this is due to the small but systematic change of galaxy radii with wavelength , with radii increasing using bluer passbands .
most of the pm2gc superdense galaxies are red , early - type galaxies ( 70% s0s and 23% ellipticals ) , quite flattened , with a mean sersic index @xmath16 , and have intermediate - to - old stellar populations , with a mean lw age = 5.5 gyr and a mean mass - weighted age = 9.3 gyr .
figure  1 illustrates the relation between size and lw age for galaxies in different mass bins and different environments ( for each galaxy mass , the lower line is the pm2gc , and the upper line is wings ) . at given size and environment ,
more massive galaxies have older ages , both in clusters and in the field , following downsizing .
the plot shows that , at given mass and environment , galaxies with smaller radii ( more compact ) are older .
this effect is present both in clusters and in the field , although our analysis ( not shown ) finds that the dependence of the median mass - size relation on stellar age is stronger in clusters than in the field .    as a consequence ,
the population of passive galaxies at low - z includes both the old , on average small galaxies and those galaxies that have stopped forming stars at later times that have on average larger sizes .
this needs to be taken into account when trying to quantify the evolution of the high - z samples .
figure  2 shows a compilation of various datasets of galaxies at @xmath18 ( different symbols , daddi et al .
2005 , trujillo et al .
2006 , van dokkum et al .
2008 , cimatti et al .
2008 , van der wel et al .
2008 , saracco et al .
2009 , damjanov et al .
2009 , mancini et al .
2010 , cassata et al . 2011 ) and their median mass - size relation ( solid line ) .    to quantify the evolution in size
, we compare this relation with the median mass - size relation of _ old _ ( lw age @xmath19 gyr ) galaxies in wings and the pm2gc ( two dotted lines in fig .  2 ) .
we find an average evolution of 0.2 - 0.25dex , a factor 1.6 - 1.8 , using wings and pm2gc , respectively .
this is half of what is found using all , passive or @xmath4 galaxies in the pm2gc , as usually done in the literature .
the evolution of galaxy sizes is therefore much smaller than would be ( erroneously ) inferred at face value considering as local descendants the whole passive galaxy population regardless of age .
using old wings or old pm2gc galaxies does not significantly change the results .
it is however important to stress that our simulations ( millennium simulation + semi - analytic model presented in de lucia & blaizot 2007 ) predict that 60% of all galaxies that at @xmath20 are massive ( @xmath21 ) and passive end up in haloes with masses above @xmath22 by @xmath12 , therefore in wings - like clusters in the local universe .
hence , a large fraction of the high - z passive and massive galaxies have evolved into today s cluster galaxies .
this may explain the strong environmental dependence of the superdense incidence we find at low - z , and indicates that galaxies in nearby clusters are the most appropriate local counterparts to the high - z studies .

 galaxies with radii and masses comparable to high - z massive and compact galaxies represent 4.4% of all galaxies more massive than @xmath0 in the field . 
 such galaxies are 3 times more frequent in clusters than in the field . 
 most of them are early - type galaxies with intermediate to old stellar populations . 
 there is a trend of smaller radii for older luminosity - weighted ages at fixed galaxy mass . 
 we show the relation between size and luminosity - weighted age for galaxies of different stellar masses and in different environments . 
 we compare with high - z data to quantify the evolution of galaxy sizes . 
 we find that , once the progenitor bias due to the relation between galaxy size and stellar age is removed , the average amount of size evolution of individual galaxies between high- and low - z is mild , of the order of a factor 1.6 . "
"collective electron states are widely used in the theory of metals  @xcite , while bulk dielectric and semiconductor materials are equally well modeled as a rigid network of covalent bonds incorporating lattice defects .
success for classic models is mainly due to extensive use of translational symmetry , which is definitely not the case for nano - sized systems : nanoparticles are mostly imperfections with perfect regions rather than perfect crystals with imperfections .
lattice termination is the main imperfection leading to the consideration of the collective surface - localized electron states problem .
however , one should clearly distinguish collective states in a metal and in a dielectric material  collectivity does nt necessarily imply conductivity , and there is no contradiction between the `` bonding '' and `` collective '' terms .
it s crucial to emphasize unambiguous meaning of the term `` collective '' we use in our paper : collective states in dielectric materials are bonding molecular orbitals , localized over several atomic cores . the fact that collective states despite their importance are rarely used in dielectric materials theory results in seemingly unresolvable issues like inability to describe the nature of the intrinsic spin found in the nanodiamond .
b.  pate has summarized study of the electronic and atomic structure of the bulk diamond in his classic paper  @xcite . almost simultaneously the nanodiamond was discovered , and its practical applications attracted great attention  @xcite , leaving behind detailed investigation of the underlying structural and electronic aspects .
nanodiamond - based materials are rapidly growing in number , triggering progress in the understanding of the cvd synthesis methods  @xcite and in the thermophysical applications of nanodiamond - based materials  @xcite . despite great success in nanodiamond applications
, there is still no in - depth understanding of its structure .
collective electron states are vital part of the global perspective which interrelates consistently magnetism , surface conductivity and the set of nanodiamond experimental `` anomalies '' .
the first theoretical investigation of the collective electron states in a bulk diamond was done by i.e.  tamm  @xcite .
his calculations were based on the idea of electron confinement between periodic lattice potential and vacuum .
we have followed tamm approach assuming that electron could be confined between vacuum and semi - periodic diamond ball kernel .
j.  kouteck then investigated surface states of a one - dimensional crystal in connection with penetration of surface potential perturbation into the crystal and was the first to introduce the term `` subsurface states ''  @xcite .
p.  phariseau then studied energy spectrum of amorphous substances and subsurface states in deformed one - dimensional crystals , treating deformed region as amorphous phase  @xcite .
direct experimental evidence of the surface layer deformation in nanodiamond molecules follows from peels  @xcite , nmr  @xcite and auger  @xcite data and allows us to make the assumption about subsurface states existence in nanodiamond .
we have concentrated our attempts on study of the collective electron states in nanodiamond in order to relate great amount of well - documented reliable experimental data with the _ ab initio _ computations of its electronic structure .
it was recently demonstrated that it s vital to take nuclear movement explicitly into account in order to describe optical gap of diamondoids  @xcite
. however , full - scale _ ab initio _ geometry optimization is still impossible for big diamondoids .
the optimization procedure must be consistent with the experimentally observed deformation , so we introduce an approximate parametric non - uniform compression to the diamond ball model , which would allow us to skip the geometry optimization and to catch the qualitatively correct picture .    the problem of collective electron states localization in nanodiamond is considered , and qualitative explanation of the nature of the experimentally observed compression , the intrinsic unpaired spin and the peels pre - peak is proposed .
orbital localization in nanodiamond was studied on model systems by exact numerical integration of schrdinger equation for one - particle model in one - dimensional kronig  penney potential and by _ ab initio _ computations of ground - state wavefunctions of small diamondoids .
simultaneous usage of both methods allows to establish their ranges of applicability and to give better approximation to real 46 nm nanodiamonds .
a one - dimensional one - electron model allows to analyze wavefunctions of big diamond balls ( 5 nm and bigger ) .
this model gives clear outcome and its solutions are exact . despite relative simplicity of one - electron approximations
it is widely used in classical solid state physics .
our calculations are made following the logic of i.e.  tamm  @xcite and a.a .
abrikosov @xcite using the test electron approach and the model of the kronig  penney ( fig.[fig : penneypotential ] ) for one - dimensional dielectric crystal , bounded on both sides by vacuum .
we consider intermediate case between pure dielectric potential in tight - binding approximation and metallic lattice potential were `` free '' electron gas moves in atomic core potential .
special application was developed to explore the one - dimensional stationary schrdinger equation solutions in a limited quasi - periodic potential using component pascal programming language in the blackbox component builder ( zrich , switzerland )  @xcite .
a set of diamond ball structures in a format compatible with a quantum - chemical software is necessary before one can perform numerical computations of wavefunctions and energies in the three - dimensional case .
application diaball ( _ http://diaball.molpit.com _ ) was developed to construct diamond balls up to 10 nm size , visualize and export molecular model in the pdb format .
the value of the lattice constant is taken to be @xmath3 nm  @xcite in order to build carbon diamond lattice inside defined radius .
two different unit cell arrangements ( atom - centered or volume - centered ) are possible , varying diamond ball structure slightly .
the structure of the compressed layer is usually and erroneously understood in terms of @xmath4-shell coating diamond core , despite the vast amount of experimental data showing inadequacy of this model .
thus , nmr spectroscopy is unable to detect a @xmath4 phase signal  @xcite above the detection limit ; neither can x - ray powder diffraction .
we conclude that the compressed layer is not to do with @xmath4-phase necessarily , so every atom in our model ( and in real best quality nanodiamond , actually ) is @xmath5-hybridized
.    software realization of controlled compression of built structures is characterized by parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 according to the next function : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the atom position shift relative to the origin , @xmath10 is the distance from atom to the origin , @xmath11 is the radius of molecule , @xmath6 is the parameter regulating amplitude of shift and @xmath7 is the parameter regulating shift decay rate inside diamond ball .
+    the chosen compression method ( [ eq : deformation ] ) allows roughly to estimate the relaxed diamond ball shell structure under surface forces resulting from self - consistency of the electron - nuclear interaction .
a quantitatively correct description of the compression is much more complex and , more importantly , would provide higher precision than we really need for demonstration purposes .      ground - state electronic structure computations for several small diamondoids @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 were performed at dft  r - b3lyp level of theory using the 6 - 31g(d , p ) basis set .
three cases were considered : non - deformed particle and two deformed configurations with compression parameters @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath12 , @xmath14 applied according to eq .
( [ eq : deformation ] ) .
computations were made in the gamess - us  @xcite software package ( may  1 ,  2012  r2 version ) .
several pure rhf computations were performed with the same basis set and have shown that wavefunction morphology is preserved in both rhf and dft computations , thus allowing one to use kohn  sham ( ks ) orbitals as a qualitatively correct basis for molecular orbital picture interpretation .
strictly speaking , ks orbitals `` are physically sound and may be expected to be more suitable for use in qualitative molecular orbital theory than either hartree  fock or semiempirical orbitals ''  @xcite , especially in the case of occupied states  @xcite .
the structure of hydrogenated diamondoids was optimized using openbabel  @xcite in the avogadro  @xcite software package and mmff94  @xcite force field .
carbon positions were fixed in case of deformed diamondoids and only the hydrogen shell was relaxed .
we have found that every bonding state in diamond balls is intrinsically collective and we classify them according to three distinct types : bonding orbitals morphologically similar to hydrogenic atom wavefunctions , tamm surface electron states and subsurface - localized electron states .
the results are illustrated both by a 1d one - particle example and by the corresponding _ ab initio _ computations .
it is worth noting that bonding molecular orbitals for 1d one - particle solutions and for spherical diamondoids ( fig .
[ fig : compare ] ) give solutions with shapes and nodal structure similar to modulated hydrogenic atom wavefunctions of s- , p- , d - shape , etc . generally , the observed orbital morphologies arise from near - spherical symmetry of the system and similarity with the particle - in - a - box case .
+      as shown in figure  [ fig : surfacestates ] , the electron density of some quantum states ( bold lines on the plot ) is located near the surface layer and their energy levels are located between the valence and conduction bands . the total number of states in valence and surface bands are equal to the number of potential wells . in accordance with
earlier discussed classical theoretical results surface state penetration into the crystal is observed if potential holes are shallow enough .
the energy level of the surface states is almost parallel in the plot of energy ( fig .
[ fig : surfacestates ] ) versus lattice constant , and can be either below or above the fermi energy ( denoted as zero line ) .
consideration of the 3d problem allows to investigate spatial localization of tamm states .
it s unclear from 1d calculations if tamm states are local in a sense of dangling bond localization or have intrinsically collective nature .
it s still impossible to compute the optimized electronic structure of real 5 nm diamond ball in the three dimensional case .
that is why we have investigated surface states of computationally feasible 1.34  nm diamondoid @xmath2 .
tamm states in the 3d singlet case are located inside virtual orbitals band and show collective and surface - localized wavefunction nature .
the homo and lumo states for the compressed and non - compressed diamondoid @xmath2 are shown on fig.[fig : surface3d ] .    [
cols='^,^ ' , ]      in this section the influence of compression on diamondoid wavefunction morphologies is investigated . assuming that 70% of diamond ball @xmath5-bonds are deformed  @xcite
, the radius of the uncompressed core of the diamond ball approximately equals to @xmath15 of the ball radius .        as can be seen from fig .

it follows that as compression is applied valence band bottom tends to shift downwards in energy , and population of the subsurface - localized states also increases .

examination of our computations shows the existence of three distinct types of solutions for both 1d and _ ab initio _
3d cases . in this section
we provide a qualitative interpretation of the nature of nanodiamond `` disordered '' shell , the epr signal invariant and the possible source of the unusual pre - peak in peels experiment .
explanation is provided in terms of collective electron state localization in nanodiamonds .      according to tamm reasoning for
a ball - shaped dielectric nanocrystal electron s can be confined in a spherical layer between the vacuum and the periodical crystal potential .
the surface electron band lies between the valence band and the conduction band .
wavefunctions of the surface states are localized near the surface and form a spherical spatial layer if we extrapolate one - dimensional case to three dimensions .
tamm electrons are locked in the radial degree of freedom but free in the angular degree of freedom , moving on the surface and belong to the whole particle as if it is a single sheet .
surface localization of wavefunctions give few solutions localized on the nanodiamond ; rather they float as the surface electrons .
such `` floating electrons '' in a bulk diamond are discussed as alternative to classical electrical contacts or leads in new electronic devices @xcite and become the base for diamond electronic devices . as shown in experiments ,
surface conductivity is sensible to modification of surface , and its existence demands hydrogen terminated surface  @xcite .
however , unpaired electrons lie under the surface of nanocrystal according to nmr data @xcite , and epr properties are also independent on surface modification @xcite .
that is why tamm surface states can not explain paramagnetic properties of nanodiamond @xcite .
nevertheless , we suggest to take into account surface states for future exploration of the transport properties of composite materials based on nanodiamond @xcite .    energy localization of these states in the middle of the band gap could be easily explained if we realize that one - particle one - dimensional model represents one - dimensional doublet radical state .
semiempirical simulations of @xmath20-mantane ( @xmath21 ) radical electron structure  @xcite show direct correspondence with the one - dimensional case , where radical energy level lie in the middle of the band gap . if we consider singlet case , tamm states would be located in the virtual orbitals band .
surface layer compression in nanodiamond is experimentally proven by peels data showing rapid decrease of compressed layer fraction for nanodiamonds and indicating presence of both `` perfect '' core and `` deformed '' shell layer  @xcite .
+     peels data for 5.2 nm nanodiamond is presented in fig .  [
fig : comparepeels ] , where distinct character of observed curves indicate presence of both `` perfect '' core and `` deformed '' shell layer .
quantitative measurements of the core and shell contributions allows to define deformed shell form the intensity of the pre - peak @xmath22 as : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the integrated intensity over the range 280295ev of the pre - edge spectrum of diamond .
this is characteristic of the distorted @xmath5-bonded environment of the atoms under the electron probe , as it passes across the nd particle , @xmath25 is the integrated @xmath26 core - loss intensity over the range 295340ev , corresponding to the bulk of the diamond particle , which is again dependent on the beam position on the nd particle shown schematically at fig .
[ fig : comparepeels]b  @xcite .
compressed shell on nanodiamond particles also appears in auger electron spectroscopy  @xcite , where clearly distinguished spectrum identifies unusual chemical states of nanodiamond .
density of states plot ( fig .
[ fig : dos ] ) indicate relative increase in the local density of subsurface - localized states .
what is more , the valence band and the conduction band bottom tend to shift to the lower energy as compression is increased .
these two facts could clarify the peculiarity of the auger spectra and the pre - peak nature observed in peels experiment .
additional evidence for core - shell structure of nanodiamond is presented in nmr study  @xcite indicating 39% atoms in core , 40% of partially disordered five - layered shell and remaining 21% attributed to two nearest to surface layers .    strictly speaking
, deformation is represented by surface layer compression which is the natural consequence of electron and nuclear structure self - consistency .
recent large - scale _ ab initio _ geometry optimization of diamondoids up to 2 nm size at dft/6 - 31 g within lda level of theory shows a gradual increase in subsurface - localized character of homo as particles grow  @xcite .
it means that if one perform `` honest '' full - scale geometry optimization at an acceptable theory level subsurface states arise naturally .
however , optimization of these structures is extremely demanding and time consuming .
we conclude that the rough compression model we employed allows qualitatively correct results to be obtained concerning orbital localization without employing full - scale first - principles optimization procedures .
to sum up , artificial compression gives similar subsurface states as first - principles geometrical optimization .
it s argued that first - principles optimization naturally results in particle non - uniform compression leading to the subsurface localization of bonding orbitals .
more importantly , these subsurface - localized bonding orbitals are collective , i.e. spread over large amount of carbon atoms located in appropriate shell .
considering our results and large - scale computations done by jiang et al .
@xcite we extrapolate subsurface orbital model to real - sized 5 nm nanodiamond .
it appears then that these orbitals have large spatial extent , allowing us to use analogy with the long conjugated @xmath27-electron systems and providing an opportunity to discuss the nature of intrinsic spin in nanodiamond .
nanodiamond exhibits unusual spin states in wide range of experiments , including epr spectroscopy and nmr relaxation .
it demonstrates uncommon to the bulk phase paramagnetic behavior .
unpaired electrons in nanodiamond show invariance of their @xmath28-factor value under experimental conditions ( epr invariant )  @xcite . in nanodiamond
@xmath29 against @xmath28-factor for a free electron @xmath30 .
the difference between @xmath28-factor values for free electron and for unpaired electron in nanodiamond is about @xmath31 , which is typical for organic radicals ( @xmath32@xmath31 ) .
this difference depends heavily on the nearest neighborhood of the unpaired electron .
radical states centered on carbon atoms have @xmath28-factor value below @xmath33 .
if an unpaired electron is localized on a carbon atom bonded to oxygen atom , @xmath28-factor value lies between @xmath33 and @xmath34 .
oxygen - centered radical state has @xmath28-factor value higher than @xmath34  @xcite .
thus the unpaired electrons in nanodiamond have @xmath28-factor values in a very narrow range and these values correspond to pure carbon atoms without any impurities in their vicinity .
if the epr signal characteristics do not depend on the surface modification including chlorination , it s source clearly does nt belong to the surface .
nmr data confirm this conclusion , indicating unpaired spin localization in subsurface layer at 0.41.0 nm deepness  @xcite .
there is also uncertainty in exact number of unpaired spins per particle , which ranges from from 1  @xcite in epr study to 40  @xcite in nmr experiment
.    observed unpaired electron behavior in nanodiamond could nt be explained in terms of quite typical localized radical state , e.g. as an @xmath35-center , because it will necessarily yield characteristic change in optical properties of the system which is not observed experimentally .
if radical state is not localized on particular defect , it must be delocalized in some sense .    to summarize
, experimental data shows that unpaired electrons in nanodiamond are located in a subsurface layer and are delocalized over significant amount of carbon atoms .
the unpaired electron is also completely unrelated to point defects and impurities .
these facts are consistent with the subsurface localization of the first several bonding orbitals in compressed diamondoids
. however , these states lie deep inside valence band and are doubly occupied , leading to fully compensated total spin .
indeed , existence of stable uncompensated spin deep inside valence band in absence of external fields would leave free position for `` upper '' electrons and is impossible .
therefore it s impossible to attribute unpaired spin of nanodiamond to any type of lattice point defects without contradicting epr invariant and nmr results .    taking into account subsurface localization of these unpaired spins ,
we attribute them to collective subsurface orbitals .
these subsurface orbitals have comparatively long extent , and spin - density fluctuations could possibly explain existence of intrinsic unpaired spin in nanodiamond .
analogy may be made with long conjugated @xmath27-electron systems where singlet instabilities of ground - state solutions are widely known  @xcite .
fluctuational nature of intrinsic spin is probably the only suitable explanation which does not contradict experimental data , chemical reason , charge or high - spin states issues .
there is no way to imagine classical radical spin1/2 state localized in the subsurface layer and being nevertheless stable .
moreover , it seems that the number of intrinsic spins depends on the magnitude of applied field which probably magnifies the spin - density fluctuations in the subsurface orbitals .
fluctuational mechanism of `` unpaired '' electron existence is consistent with the fact that nanodiamond has no unpaired electrons in absence of external field
.    similar behavior of bulk materials subjected to mechanical damage was observed in ge , si , hexagonal sic , diamond , mgo , cao , zno , sro , cas and zns  @xcite .
epr line observed in these materials shows invariance under surface layer condition .
it was found that `` paramagnetic centers do not involve impurities present in the starting material '' , and authors concluded that `` it must be realized that powders prepared from diamagnetic starting materials might turn out to be strongly paramagnetic ''  @xcite .
their observations are very similar to the nanodiamond case .
consideration of these results allows us to propose similar explanation for paramagnetic center appearance under mechanical damage as a result of spin - density fluctuations in long collective molecular orbital localized on the damaged area .
three distinct classes of collective electron states have been found : collective bonding orbitals resembling the morphology of 3d - modulated particle in a box solutions ; surface - localized non - bonding conductive tamm states and subsurface - localized bonding states for non - uniformly compressed nanodiamond .
first - principles computations unambiguously show that every molecular orbital responsible for chemical bonding is collective .
surface compression plays crucial role in determining orbital localization inside nanodiamond , and we suggest to use `` buried layer electron states '' term for these states .    on the base of buried layer electron states model we suggest that collective unpaired electrons are intrinsic to nanodiamond . their subsurface localization is described in terms of surface compression arising form self - consistency of electrons and nuclei positions .
intrinsic spin existence is supposed to result from collective and spread nature of subsurface orbitals , allowing spin - density fluctuation effects to become significant on this length scale . suggested model could explain free spins exhibited in experiments avoiding contradictions such as when one tries to attribute unpaired or free spin to radicals localized on nanodiamond surface .
consideration of the density of states plot shows local increase in the subsurface - states density and shift of the valence and conduction band bottom towards lower energy .
these results are promising and hopefully could explain peculiarity of the nanodiamond auger spectra and peels experiments .

"past and present collider experiments have explored high - energy processes at energy scales at the order of or below the masses @xmath0 and @xmath1 of the weak gauge bosons .
but the large hadron collider ( lhc ) and the proposed international linear collider ( ilc ) will reach scattering energies in the tev regime .
for the first time , the characteristic energy  @xmath2 of the reactions will be very large compared to @xmath0 . at these high energies
@xmath3 , electroweak radiative corrections are enhanced by large logarithms @xmath4 , which start to be sizable at energies of a few hundred gev and increase with energy . at lhc and ilc
, logarithmic electroweak effects can amount to tens of per cent at one loop and several per cent at two loops . in view of the expected experimental precision especially at ilc , theoretical predictions with an accuracy of about @xmath5
are required , so the two - loop corrections are crucial .    for sufficiently high  @xmath2 , mass - suppressed terms of @xmath6 become negligible and the electroweak corrections assume the form of a tower of logarithms with terms @xmath7 , @xmath8 , at @xmath9 loops .
the leading logarithms ( lls ) with power @xmath10 are known as sudakov logarithms  @xcite .
the subleading logarithms with @xmath11 are denoted as next - to - leading logarithmic ( nll ) , next - to - next - to - leading logarithmic ( n@xmath12ll ) terms , and so on .
the experience with four - fermion processes  @xcite shows that the subleading logarithmic contributions may be of the same size as the leading ones . in addition
, large cancellations occur between the individual logarithmic terms , so the restriction to the ll approximation is not sufficient , and the nll corrections or even further subleading terms are required .
logarithms @xmath4 arise from mass singularities , when a virtual gauge boson ( photon  @xmath13 , @xmath14 or @xmath15 boson ) couples to an on - shell external leg and to any other ( internal or external ) line of the diagram .
the region where the gauge boson momentum is collinear to the momentum of the external particle yields a single - logarithmic one - loop contribution . in the special case
that the gauge boson is exchanged between two different external legs , a double - logarithmic contribution arises from the regions where the gauge boson momentum is soft and collinear to one of the external momenta .
in addition , ultraviolet ( uv ) singularities lead to single - logarithmic contributions .    in the case of photons ,
the mass singularities are not regulated by a finite gauge boson mass . in @xmath16 space
 time dimensions , the singularities appear as poles @xmath17 and @xmath18 per loop . for a consistent treatment of leading and subleading logarithmic contributions
, each pole in @xmath19 has to be counted like a logarithm @xmath4 .
finite masses of the external particles regularize the collinear singularities and lead to logarithms involving these masses .
it has been shown at one loop for arbitrary processes  @xcite and at two loops for massless fermionic processes  @xcite that the electroweak ll and nll corrections are universal : they depend only on the quantum numbers of the external particles and can be written in terms of universal correction factors which factorize from the born matrix element .
two - loop electroweak corrections at high energies have been studied in recent years with two complementary approaches . on the one hand , evolution equations known from qcd
have been applied to the electroweak theory by splitting the latter into a symmetric @xmath20 regime above the weak scale  @xmath0 and a qed regime below the weak scale .
then the evolution equations permit to resum the one - loop result to all orders in perturbation theory . from this approach the ll  @xcite and nll  @xcite corrections for arbitrary processes as well as the n@xmath12ll approximation for massless four - fermion processes @xmath21
@xcite are known , where the nll and n@xmath12ll terms are valid in the equal mass approximation @xmath22 .    on the other hand ,
various calculations have checked and extended the resummation predictions by explicit diagrammatic two - loop calculations . at first , the lls for the fermionic form factor  @xcite were obtained , then the lls for arbitrary processes  @xcite , the angular - dependent nlls for arbitrary processes  @xcite and the complete nlls for the massless fermionic form factor  @xcite . finally , the n@xmath23ll approximation for the massless fermionic form factor was calculated for @xmath22 and combined with the evolution equations , yielding the n@xmath23ll corrections for massless neutral - current four - fermion processes in an expansion @xmath24 around the equal mass case  @xcite .
in order to complete the missing diagrammatic nll calculations , the goal of this project is to derive virtual two - loop electroweak corrections for arbitrary processes in nll accuracy .
in contrast to the resummation approaches , we rely on the complete spontaneously broken electroweak theory . we consider processes with external momenta  @xmath25 , where all kinematical invariants , @xmath26 , are of the order of the large scale @xmath27 .
we implement the particle masses @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , which are different , but of the same order .
in particular , we consider a massive top quark and neglect the masses of the other fermions .
we thus get combinations of large logarithms @xmath30 and poles in  @xmath19 from virtual photons . at @xmath9 loops , terms @xmath31
are lls if @xmath10 , and nlls if @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) .
the nll coefficients involve angular - dependent logarithms , @xmath34 , and logarithms of mass ratios , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .
we have completed the calculation for processes with massless external fermions  @xcite and are about to extend our results to massive fermionic processes .      in order to extract the mass singularities from the loop diagrams , we first isolate the so - called factorizable contributions : these are diagrams where the gauge bosons couple only to external legs , not to internal legs of the tree subdiagram , and where the gauge boson momenta have been set to zero in the tree subdiagram . for these factorizable contributions we use a soft  collinear approximation which eliminates the dirac structure of the loop corrections and
factorizes the loop integrals from the born matrix element .
this approximation is an extension of the eikonal approximation and reproduces the correct nll result not only for soft , but also for collinear gauge bosons .
the remaining non - factorizable contributions are obtained by subtracting from all diagrams yielding mass singularities the factorizable contributions .
we have shown that the non - factorizable contributions vanish due to the collinear ward identities proven in  @xcite .
therefore only the factorizable contributions need to be evaluated explicitly . for the ll and nll terms at two loops ,
we need a double - logarithmic contribution from a soft and collinear gauge boson which is exchanged between two different external legs , and another , at least single - logarithmic , loop correction .
the two - loop factorizable contributions in the case of massless external fermions are depicted in figure  [ fig:2loopfact ] .
+        the factorizable diagrams also include nll contributions from uv momentum regions .
when a subdiagram with a small characteristic scale of the order @xmath37 yields uv singularities which are renormalized at the scale  @xmath38 , large logarithms @xmath4 arise .
the soft  collinear approximation mentioned above is not valid for uv momenta , so we can not use it for subdiagrams of this type and employ projection techniques instead .
we have evaluated the loop integrals of the factorizable contributions with two independent methods : an automatized algorithm which is based on the sector decomposition technique  @xcite , and the method of expansion by regions combined with mellin 
barnes representations ( see  @xcite and references therein ) . the nll result for massless fermionic processes @xmath39 has been published in  @xcite .
it allows to write the combined one- and two - loop result in the factorized form @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the born matrix element , and the correction terms read @xmath42 $ ] , @xmath43 and @xmath44 $ ] .
the symmetric - electroweak factor @xmath45 equals the result from a symmetric @xmath20 theory where all gauge boson masses are equal to  @xmath0 .
the factor @xmath46 incorporates the terms from the mass difference @xmath47 . and the electromagnetic terms in @xmath48 factorize and exponentiate separately , such that a separation of the singularities due to the massless photon is possible .
the one - loop terms @xmath49 and @xmath50 get exponentiated , and the additional two - loop terms @xmath51 and @xmath52 are proportional to @xmath53-function coefficients . for details of the correction terms , we refer to  @xcite .
our results confirm the resummation predictions based on the evolution equations . by applying our general correction factors to the case of massless four - fermion scattering
, we have found agreement with the neutral - current results in  @xcite , and we have obtained a new nll result for the charged - current processes .
for massive external fermions , the diagrams from the factorizable contributions have to be reevaluated , additional diagrams with yukawa interactions have to be considered and the cancellation of the non - factorizable contributions must be verified . this section deals with new complications which arise from massive external fermions in the loop integrals
.      expansion by regions  @xcite is a powerful method for the asymptotic expansion of loop integrals .
it is based on the following recipe : divide the integration domain of the loop momenta into regions corresponding to the asymptotic limit considered . in every region , expand the integrand appropriately .
integrate each of the expanded terms over the whole integration domain .
the integrand is expanded before integration , and each expanded term has a unique order in powers of the large scale @xmath2 and the small scale @xmath0 .
but on - shell momenta  @xmath25 of massive external particles involve two scales , as their momentum squared is @xmath54 and their combinations with other external momenta are @xmath55 . in order to separate these two scales ,
the external momenta are reparametrized in terms of light - like momenta  @xmath56 as @xmath57 , with some other external leg @xmath58 and @xmath59 , @xmath60  @xcite . through this shift
, all contractions of external momenta with loop momenta can now be divided into parts of distinct scales , and the expansion is done in inverse powers of the new large scales @xmath61 .    with respect to any pair of external light - like momenta @xmath62 , the loop momenta can be expressed in sudakov components parallel and perpendicular to these external momenta : @xmath63 , with @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 . in each region , the components of the loop momenta are assigned specific sizes in powers of @xmath2 and @xmath0 .
typical regions are listed in table  [ tab : regions ] .
.typical regions with the corresponding sizes of loop momentum components [ cols='^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^',options='header ' , ]     while the hard , soft , collinear and ultrasoft regions are already present for massless external particles , the two ultracollinear regions are only relevant for massive external particles .
asymptotic expansions with small masses and large kinematical scales not only produce logarithmic mass singularities , but also power singularities @xmath67 and @xmath68 .
these are generated at two loops by subdiagrams with a small scale of the order @xmath37 .
the method of expansion by regions predicts , for the contribution of each region , where power singularities can appear , by means of a simple power counting in the expanded integrals .
when complete feynman diagrams are considered , the terms in the numerator ensure the cancellation of the power singularities . in diagrams where power singularities are present for individual scalar integrals , care
must be taken to keep all the mass factors in the numerator which ensure the cancellations .
in particular , the masses in the numerator of fermion propagators and in the dirac equation of the spinors may not be neglected .
therefore we are not allowed to use the soft  collinear approximation for small - scale subdiagrams .
however , these are exactly the same diagrams where we have employed alternative projection techniques already in the massless case in order to get the uv contributions right .
additional complications originate from fermion masses in the numerator due to the chiral structure of the electroweak theory . with each mass factor along a fermion line , the chirality of the fermion in its interactions with the weak gauge bosons changes .
we have found , though , that fermion masses in the numerator are relevant exclusively in pure qed diagrams where the chirality changes do not matter .
we have completed the calculation of all factorizable contributions involving two massive or massless external fermion legs .
this permits to determine the two - loop form factor in an abelian model with both a massive gauge boson ( mass  @xmath0 , coupling  @xmath69 ) and a massless one ( coupling  @xmath70 ) .
the one - loop form factor as a function of the two external fermion masses is given by @xmath71 $ ] .
the nll contribution ( up to the order  @xmath72 ) from the massive gauge boson is independent of the fermion masses , @xmath73 with @xmath30 , while the contribution from the massless gauge boson is split into a completely massless part and corrections for each of the fermion masses : @xmath74 with @xmath75 .
we have found that the nll two - loop form factor ( without closed fermion loops ) simply exponentiates the one - loop result , @xmath76 ^ 2 $ ] .
we evaluate two - loop electroweak corrections in nll accuracy for arbitrary processes with massive and massless external fermions .
the methods which we have successfully applied for massless fermions work well also in the massive case , and the complications arising from fermion masses are under control .
preliminary results are already available for the form factor , they factorize and exponentiate like in the massless case .
the calculation for processes with external fermions will soon be completed , and our method can be extended to arbitrary processes involving external gauge bosons or scalar particles .

 this talk summarizes the results for massless fermionic processes and presents new aspects arising in the extension of the corresponding loop calculations to massive external fermions . as a preliminary result , 
 the abelian form factor for massive fermions is given . "
"energetic heavy quarks passing through the qgp , observed by the resulting mesons , are viewed as a suitable probe for the interactions inside the qgp , in particular for the mechanisms of energy loss , as they are less likely to thermalize within the medium and are mostly created at early stages of the medium evolution .
however , models of both purely collisional energy loss and combinations of collisional and radiative energy loss are equally successful for reproducing the nuclear modification factor @xmath0 and the elliptic flow @xmath1  @xcite .
angular correlations between two mesons represent alternative observables to make progress for discriminating between the two different interaction mechanisms .
previous studies , e.g. ref .
@xcite , used azimuthal correlations between pairs of heavy mesons such as @xmath2-@xmath3 pairs to distinguish between the energy - loss scenarios described . as an alternative , one can investigate the angular correlations between pairs of heavy and light mesons ( @xmath2 and @xmath4 ) in the forward direction .
this second approach is more sensitive to medium effects on the evolution of an individual jet , e.g. angular jet - broadening .    in order to perform such a study a monte - carlo code that simulates parton cascades , based on a similar approach as in ref .
@xcite , was created .
this algorithm allows for parton branchings and , furthermore , includes interactions of the cascade - particles with the medium in an effective model . in case of parton branchings ,
the outgoing partons and their four - momenta are selected from the distributions of splitting functions for collinear splitting , of leading order of @xmath5 , cf .
the parton cascades are initiated by a single heavy quark with a certain energy @xmath6 , and a maximal virtuality @xmath7 and follow an evolution down to a virtuality threshold @xmath8 .
the angular two - particle correlations considered are distributions over the angles @xmath9 between the direction of the three - momenta of the heavy quark and that of every other cascade particle in its final state .
studies involving heavy quarks have the crucial advantage that the heavy particle can be tagged among the jet particles . from ref .
@xcite it can be deduced that for sufficiently high virtualities @xmath10 , where @xmath11 , the radiation behavior of a heavy quark can be approximated by that of a massless quark .
therefore , the same splitting functions are used for , heavy as well as light quarks , while the explicit inclusion of a quark mass remains to be done in further studies .
the jet - medium interaction is described by a continuous increase of squared virtuality @xmath12 over time , according to the law @xmath13 , during the propagation of the partons in the medium , cf .
this kind of approach serves as an effective model for medium - induced radiation , since partons with these additional amounts of virtuality will , on average , branch more often than their vacuum counterparts . in the monte - carlo implementation of the in - medium propagation , the continuous interactions with the cascade particles were discretized over small time - steps @xmath14 , which leads to the following changes in parton virtuality over time : @xmath15 in order to avoid confusion of the medium effects present in cascades of this kind of effective model with consequences of three - momentum transfers from medium to jet particles , the virtuality increase was attributed solely to an increase in parton energy , i.e. : @xmath16 the evolution of the transfer @xmath17 within the medium was fitted to a hydrodynamical description in ref .
in particular , it is assumed that the initial quarks of the cascades are created at the center of a medium that extends up to @xmath18  fm / c . in order to quantify the strength of the jet - medium interaction ,
the quantity @xmath19 was used , defined as @xmath20    , normalized to the average particle number per cascade .

the investigation of medium effects on the evolution of parton cascades by means of two - particle correlations focused initially on a verification of angular broadening , which is later on studied via more refined observables .
the left panel of fig .
[ fig1 ] shows angular correlations in the form of @xmath22 for different values of @xmath19 .
a broadening of the distribution with increasing @xmath19 can be observed . in order to quantify this medium effect ,
the mean values of @xmath21 are depicted in the right panel of fig .
[ fig1 ] as functions of @xmath19 .    to understand how angular correlations are built up during jet evolution , the sets of parton cascades obtained by monte - carlo simulations were sorted with regard to their topologies .
a simple interesting case consists of a quark that splits two times successively into a quark and a gluon .
the average values of the angles between the outgoing quark and gluon in the first and second splitting , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively , are shown in fig  [ fig2 ] .
in contrast to the first branching angle the second branching angle increases strongly with @xmath19 . this behavior can be explained with the much smaller virtualities of the quark after the first splitting than in the initial state .
thus , the time between the first and second splitting is longer than the time before the first splitting , which results in higher amounts of accumulated virtuality from jet - medium interactions .
( crosses ) and @xmath24 ( stars ) , respectively , as a function of @xmath19 for cascades with two consecutive gluon radiations from a single quark line together with the standard deviations of the distributions over @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( boxes ) .
the cascades were extracted from the set used for the results in fig .
[ fig1 ] . ]     for parton cascades with @xmath25  gev and @xmath26  gev that are subjected to elastic ( left panel ) and inelastic ( right panel ) jet - medium interactions , both for @xmath27  gev@xmath28 .
only particles with a three - momentum that fulfills @xmath29  gev were considered .
the distributions are normalized to the average number of the corresponding parton pairs per cascade . ]    furthermore , in fig .
[ fig2 ] , one observes angular ordering in the form @xmath30 in the vacuum . in the medium , this behavior is weakened , and for @xmath31  gev@xmath28 even inversed . in order to find realistic observables that allow to look for such a kind of effect , and , furthermore , to discriminate between elastic and inelastic jet - medium interactions ,
the distribution @xmath32 was considered .
there , @xmath33 is the angle between the directions of the three - momenta of the entire jet and of the tagged heavy quark . for the elastic jet - medium interactions ,
an effective model analogous to the one for inelastic scattering was used : in this model , however , the virtualities @xmath10 are constant during in - medium propagation , while the partons experience a longitudinal drag force and transverse momentum transfers following the description in ref .  @xcite . in the elastic model ,
the transport coefficient is @xmath34 .
[ fig3 ] compares the distributions @xmath32 for both models with the same value @xmath27  gev@xmath28 .
one can observe a strong broadening in @xmath9 for the elastic model , while this effect is less apparent for the inelastic model .
for the latter , the peak of the distribution can be found at larger values of @xmath9 than for the elastic model , where the peak of the distribution occurs at higher @xmath33 values .
it was verified for parton cascades produced in an effective model for medium - induced radiation that angular two - particle correlations are sensitive observables to an angular broadening in the medium .
a further investigation of cascades of particular topologies showed that later stages of jet evolution are more sensitive to this medium effect than earlier ones , which ultimately results in an inversion of angular ordering .
currently , angular two - particle correlations are investigated in another effective model that is based on elastic collisions in an approach presented in ref .
it was shown that more sophisticated correlations could be useful to discriminate between the models for hq - jet modifications by the medium , although they are more difficult to extract from the background .

"the discovery of the acceleration of the universe through the sneia hubble diagram @xcite , recently awarded by the nobel prize , has been latter confirmed by wide range of data , from more recent sneia data to baos and cmbr anisotropies @xcite . on the other hand
, such overwhelming abundance of observational evidences in favour of the cosmic speed up does not fit in the framework of general relativity ( gr ) making clear that out theoretical background is seriously flawed . the naive interpretation that an unexpected new ingredient in the form of a negative pressured component is driving the acceleration poses difficult questions on its nature and
nurture and introduces further problems hard to be solved .
it has therefore gained more and more attraction the hypothesis that the cosmic speed up is rather the first signal of a breakdown of our understanding of the laws of gravity on cosmological scales .
motivated by this consideration , much attention has been dedicated to @xmath2 theories @xcite where the scalar curvature @xmath3 is replaced by a suitably chosen function @xmath2 in the gravity lagrangian .
looking for a correction to gr , it is instructive to remember that an equivalent formulation is represented by teleparallelism . in this theory ,
torsion , instead of curvature , is responsible of the gravitational interaction @xcite and the weitzenbock connection replaces the levi - civita one on the underlying riemann - cartan spacetime . in this scenario , gravitational interaction is not replaced by geometry and the torsion acts as a force , allowing the interpretation of gravity as a gauge theory of the translation group @xcite . despite conceptual differences , teleparallel gravity and gr yield equivalent dynamics so that the interpretation of the gravitational interaction in terms of a curved or torsioned spacetime is only a matter of convenience , at least at the classical level .    in as much the same way as for @xmath2 theories , one can obtain a generalised teleparallel gravity replacing @xmath4 with a generic function @xmath0 thus opening the way to a rich phenomenology .
a particular important consequence is the breakdown of the equivalence with the classical gr with the two theories now predicting a radically different dynamics @xcite .
modified teleparallel gravity preserves the advantage of giving equations that are still second order in field derivatives opposite to the fourth order equations deduced in @xmath2 gravity thus avoiding unpleasant pathologies . on the other hand ,
it suffers from the lack of local lorentz invariance ( lli ) so that all the 16 components of the vierbien are independent and one can not simply fix 6 of them by a gauge choice @xcite .    a critical role in generalised teleparallel theories is played by the choice of the functional expression for @xmath0 .
the lack of firmly established theoretical constraints leaves open the way to a wide range of possibilities which can only be validated a posteriori , i.e. by contrasting their predictions with the observational data .
this is the aim of the present work where we focus our attention on two particular classes able to give rise to a phantom - like behaviour of the effective torsion fluid .
we then test these two models against sneia+grb hubble diagram , @xmath1 measurements from cosmic chronometers , baos data and the cmbr distance priors .
although wide , the present dataset only traces the background expansion so that we will also investigate whether further insight into the properties of these models can be obtained by the analysis of the growth factor being this latter a quick way to look at how perturbations evolve in the proposed modified teleparallel scenarios .
the layout of the paper is as follows . in sect.[f(t ) ] , we briefly review the cosmology of @xmath0 gravity and present the two models we are going to analyse . sect.[data ] is devoted to the likelihood analysis and the results , while sect.[growth ] enlarges the study to the growth factor .
finally , conclusions and perspectives are drawn in sect.[conclusions ] .
teleparallelism is a dynamical theory for the vierbein @xmath5 , whose components in a given coordinate basis @xmath6 help in introducing the metric as a subsidiary field :    @xmath7    where @xmath8 .
the dynamics is then described by the action    @xmath9 e d^4x } + { \cal{s}}_m \ , \label{eq : action}\ ] ]    where @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the action for the matter fields . in eq.([eq : action ] ) , a key role is played by @xmath0 which is a differentiable function of the torsion tensor @xmath4 defined as    @xmath12    with    @xmath13    @xmath14    varying the action with respect to the vierbein components @xmath15 , one gets the field equations    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the matter energy - momentum tensor and subscripts @xmath4 denote differentation with respect to @xmath4 .
one can naively expect that , in order to get the cosmological counterpart of the field equations , one has simply to insert the robertson - walker ( rw ) metric into eqs.([eq : fieldeqs ] ) .
actually , some care is needed since , due to the lack of lli , two pairs of vierbein that lead to the same metric tensor are not equivalent from the point of view of the theory .
nevertheless , in case of spatially flat rw metric , a convenient choice is represented by the diagonal vierbein , i.e. @xcite    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the scale factor as function of cosmic time @xmath20 .
with such a choice , the dynamical equations become :    @xmath21    while the torsion scalar reduces to @xmath22 with @xmath23 the usual hubble parameter and @xmath24 the energy density and pressure of the matter component .
note that hereafter we will denote with a prime and with a dot differentiation with respect to @xmath25 and @xmath20 , respectively .
the modified friedmann equations ( [ eq : ftfried ] ) can be rewritten in the usual form by introducing an effective dark torsion fluid with energy density reading    @xmath26    since matter still minimally couples to gravity only , its conservation equation will be unaffected so that we still have @xmath27 and @xmath28 for the scaling laws of dust matter and radiation . imposing the bianchi identities and the diffeomorphism invariance of the theory , the conservation equation for the effective torsion fluid reads    @xmath29    having set    @xmath30    for the equation of state ( eos ) of the dark torsion fluid .
note the coupling to the radiation energy density through the term @xmath31 . for @xmath32 ,
one has @xmath33 and teleparallel gravity goes back to the standard gr , while the choice @xmath34 gives @xmath35 and the @xmath36cdm model is recovered .
moving away from the naive choice @xmath34 gives rise to rich phenomenology in the dynamical evolution of generalised teleparallel theories .
there are actually almost no theoretical hints on the functional form of @xmath0 with , on the contrary , many possible expressions leading to an accelerated expansion .
it is particularly interesting to look at models which are able to give rise to an effective eos ( defined later ) crossing the phantom divide , i.e. , @xmath37 for @xmath38 with @xmath39 the phantom divide redshift .
two recently proposed model of this kind can be obtained setting @xcite     ( dot dashed blue ) , @xmath40 ( solid black ) , @xmath41 ( dashed red ) and the fiducial @xmath42 used in the text.,width=283 ]    @xmath43 } \\

\ , \label{eq : ftmods}\ ] ]    where the subscript @xmath44 denotes present day quantities .    in the first case , which we will refer to as the tanh model
, one should set @xmath45 in order to have a dark torsion fluid with a positive energy density , while the same condition leads to @xmath46 for the second choice , referred to hereafter as the exp model .
the constant @xmath47 can be expressed as a function of the other parameters by inserting eq.([eq : ftmods ] ) into the friedmann equations ( [ eq : ftfried ] ) and imposing @xmath48 .
this gives :    @xmath49    for the tanh and exp model .
note that we have dropped the @xmath44 subscripts for the dust and radiation present day density parameters @xmath50 to simplify the notation .
plane imposing @xmath51 for the exp model with @xmath52 ( dot dashed blue ) , @xmath40 ( solid black ) , @xmath41 ( dashed red ) and the fiducial @xmath42 used in the text .
note that the lower set of contours are almost perfectly superimposed.,width=283 ]    it is instructive to look at the effective torsion fluid eos @xmath53 for the two @xmath0 models we are considering .
we do not give here the lengthy expressions which can be obtained by inserting eqs.([eq : ftmods ] ) into the definition ( [ eq : fteos ] ) , but show how its present day value @xmath54 depend on the @xmath0 parameters in figs.[fig : wzefftanh ] and [ fig : wzeffexp ] for the tanh and exp model , respectively .
since the @xmath36cdm model is known to very well fit the data , it is reasonable to expect that , in order to fit the same data , the parameter space of both models will collapse in a region giving @xmath55 .
fig.[fig : wzefftanh ] shows that , for the tanh model , this will favour values of @xmath56 and that the larger is @xmath57 , the smaller @xmath58 must be in order to have a today effective eos close to the @xmath36cdm one .
this same requirement works in a different way for the exp model .
fig.[fig : wzeffexp ] , indeed , shows that , for given @xmath59 values , there can be more models with @xmath55 but different @xmath60 .
put in other words , the @xmath61 parameters are intrinsically degenerate so that the condition @xmath55 is unable to discriminate among different parameter sets .
actually , when fitting the data , we do not only look at the present day @xmath62 value , but also to its variation with @xmath63 . as we will see
, this helps breaking ( at least partially ) the degeneracy among @xmath64 for the tanh model and @xmath61 for the exp one .
figs.[fig : wzefftanh ] and [ fig : wzeffexp ] are nevertheless useful to quickly grasp what is the region of the parameter space of greater interest for both the tanh and exp @xmath0 models .
the above considerations on the effective eos suggest that the proposed generalised teleparallel scenarios can represent viable alternatives to the @xmath36cdm model . to check whether this is indeed the case , we contrast them with a wide set of cosmological data as described below .      in order to answer the question whether @xmath0 gravity can reproduce the observed universe
, we will explore the model parameter spaces by investigating the following likelihood function    @xmath65    where the set of model parameters is    @xmath66    for the tanh and exp models , respectively , @xmath67 being the hubble constant @xmath68 in units of @xmath69 , and we have set the present day radiation density parameter as    @xmath70    with @xmath71 in agreement with wmap7 @xcite constraints .
all the terms in the full likelihood can be written as :    @xmath72}}{(2 \pi)^{{\cal{n}}_i/2 } \gamma_i^{1/2}}\ ] ]    where @xmath73 depend on the dataset used .
the first term refers to the hubble diagram , i.e. the distance modulus @xmath74 as function of the redshift @xmath63 .
this is related to the underlying cosmological model as    @xmath75 } \label{eq : defmu}\ ] ]    with @xmath76 the luminosity distance and    @xmath77    the comoving distance . as a tracer ,
we use both the union2 sneia dataset @xcite , comprising @xmath78 objects wiht @xmath79 , and @xmath80 grbs probing the redshift range @xmath81 with the distance modulus estimated in @xcite starting from the data in @xcite . for both datasets
, it is    @xmath82    @xmath83 ^ 2 } \ , \ ] ]    where @xmath84 is the measurement error for the @xmath85-th object , while @xmath86 takes care of the intrinsic scatter of the tracer around the relations used to estimate its @xmath74 value . for sneia , we set @xmath87 , while , for grbs , this is a nuisance parameter we marginalize over .    while the hubble diagram probes the integrated expansion rate , the second dataset we use explicitly refers to the hubble parameter @xmath1 as determined through the differential age method @xcite . by using red envelope galaxies as cosmic chronometers @xcite , stern et al .
have estimated @xmath1 over the redshift range @xmath88 @xcite . to this sample ,
we add the @xmath68 determination from local distance ladders derived by the shoes collaboration @xcite and define a total @xmath89 as for the sneia one .    while sneia and grbs probe the distance - redshift relation as standardizeable candles , baryon acoustic oscillations ( baos ) work as standard rulers .
we therefore add the term @xmath90 to the full likelihood following the method detailed in @xcite . to this end , three different sets of data are used .
first , one use the 6dfgrs @xcite and the sdss @xcite surveys to determine the scaled volume distance parameter    @xmath91^{-\frac{1}{3 } } \ , \label{eq : defdz}\ ] ]    with the sound horizon to distance @xmath63 given by    @xmath92    and @xmath93 is the drag redshift .
the @xmath94 value at @xmath95 and its error is taken from @xcite , while @xcite gives @xmath94 for @xmath96 and @xmath97 with the corresponding covariance matrix .
further baos constraints come from the wigglez survey @xcite which recommend to use as observable quantity the acoustic parameter @xcite    @xmath98    with the volume distance @xmath99 given in eq.([eq : defdz ] ) .
we use the observed values and their covariance matrix for @xmath100 determinations at @xmath101 reported in @xcite .
we finally define the bao likelihood as    @xmath102    with    @xmath103 ^ 2 \right \ } } \ , \ ] ]    @xmath104 } \nonumber \ , \end{aligned}\ ] ]    @xmath105 } \nonumber \ , \end{aligned}\ ] ]    where @xmath106 is a @xmath107 dimensional vector with the difference between observed and predicted values and @xmath108 the corresponding covariance matrix .

@xmath109 and @xmath110 confidence levels . [ cols='^,^,^,^,^,^',options='header ' , ]      the best fit parameters and marginalized constraints for the tanh and exp model are given in tables [ tab : tanhfit ] and [ tab : expfit ] , while fig.[fig : bfplot ] shows the remarkable agreement among the best fit models predictions and the sneia+grb hubble diagram and @xmath1 data .
the overall good quality of the fit may be further appreciated by comparing the model predictions for the bao and cmb quantities with the observed values . for the tanh model , we get    @xmath111    @xmath112    @xmath113    so that the best fit tanh model predictions are well within @xmath114 from the observed values . for the exp model , we get    @xmath115    @xmath116    @xmath117    still in good agreement with the bao and cmbr data .    the left panel in fig.[fig : bfplot ] is quite instructive showing us how the two best fit models can not be discriminated at all based on the hubble diagram data .
this can be easily understood looking at the right panel where one can see that the rate expansion @xmath1 is quite similar among the two models with the largest deviations occurring in the redshift range @xmath118 .
being of order only few @xmath119 , it is easy to understand that the integration needed to compute the distance modulus easily washes out the differences between the two models thus leading to the almost perfectly superimposed curves shown in fig.[fig : bfplot ] .
another way to explain why the two models make so similar predictions is to look at the reconstructed effective torsion fluid eos .
fig.[fig : eosplot ] shows @xmath53 as constrained by the likelihood analysis . in each panel
, the red solid curve refers to the best fit model , while the blue dot - dashed ( dashed ) one gives , for each @xmath63 , the median value ( the @xmath109 confidence range ) as estimated evaluating @xmath120 for the model parameters in the mcmc chain . for both best fit models
( i.e. , look at the red curves ) , the eos stays close to the cosmological constant value @xmath121 up to @xmath122 so that the dynamics is approximately the same as the @xmath36cdm one . on the other hand
, @xmath53 has a radical different behaviour for the two models in the higher redshift regime .
indeed , while the tanh effective torsion fluid has an increasing eos , the exp model eos stays roughly constant to a value slightly smaller than the present day one thus better mimicking a @xmath36cdm scenario .
nevertheless , both best fit models make similar predictions for the cmbr distance priors as a result of the very small contribution of the torsion fluid to the energy budget at the last scattering surface .    as a final remark
, it is worth spending some more words on an unusual feature of the exp model .
as one can see from table[tab : expfit ] , the best fit @xmath61 parameters are strongly different from their median values with @xmath60 being outside the @xmath110 confidence range . as a consequence ,
the reconstructed torsion fluid eos for the best fit model is outside the @xmath109 confidence range delimited by the blue dashed lines in the right panel of fig.[fig : eosplot ] .
such an unexpected result is actually a consequence of the strong degeneracy among the model parameters . as already highlighted when commenting fig.[fig : wzeffexp ] , for a given @xmath57 value , there are more than one @xmath60 value giving the same @xmath123 .
this intrinsic degeneracy can only partially be broken by fitting data at different redshifts . however , since most part of the data probes the range @xmath124 , all the couples @xmath61 giving @xmath125 over this range are allowed by the fit .
this is indeed the case for the exp models with @xmath61 set to their best fit values ( leading to @xmath126 ) or to the median ones ( giving @xmath127 ) . for larger @xmath63 ,
the median and best fit models eos are radically different , but the predicted distance priors values are nevertheless almost the same since the torsion fluid becomes subdominant so that the details of its eos turn out to be meaningless . in the following
, we will however set the @xmath61 parameters to their median values since such a choice more reliably takes into account how the data constrain the exp model parameters space .
for the tanh ( red solid ) and exp ( blue dashed ) @xmath0 models superimposed to the @xcite data.,width=283 ]    the above analysis , while confirming that both @xmath0 models nicely work at reproducing the available data , has also highlighted that probing only the background expansion does not allow us to conclusively discriminate between them and the @xmath36cdm scenario . in order to deepen the investigation and look for a way to put stronger constraints
, one has to resort to the analysis of the evolution of the perturbations . as a first step ,
we consider here the growth factor @xmath128 with @xmath129 the matter density contrast .
the @xmath130 evolution can easily be determined solving @xcite    @xmath131    which is formally identical to the @xmath36cdm one provided the newton constant @xmath132 is replaced by the effective one @xmath133 .
it is worth stressing that eq.([eq : growthfac ] ) actually holds only in the sub - horizon limit , i.e. , under the approximation @xmath134 with @xmath135 the comoving expansion rate .
a much more complicated expression @xcite holds in the general case and must be used in evaluating large scale probes as the matter power spectrum and , for instance , weak lensing observables .
however , for this preliminary investigation , we will use the simpler eq.([eq : growthfac ] ) which is well suited for galactic and galaxy cluster scales .
fig.[fig : gzplot ] shows the growth factor for the best fit tanh and the median exp models together with a compilation of @xmath136 measurement taken from @xcite .
as it is evident , the two models can be easily differentiated from the different @xmath136 behaviour , while their background expansion is almost the same as shown by the very close agreement between the corresponding @xmath137 and @xmath1 curves plotted in fig.[fig : bfplot ] . according to the @xmath136 values ,
structures growth is faster in the tanh than in the exp model so that an observational determination of @xmath136 can easily discriminate among the two @xmath0 scenarios . indeed , using the data plotted , we get @xmath138 for the tanh model indicating a strong disagreement , while better results are obtained for the exp model leading to @xmath139 ( still large , but mainly due to the highest @xmath63 point which is not even fitted by the @xmath36cdm growth factor ) .
these values have , however , to be taken with great caution and should not be considered as a definitive evidence of the exp model working better than the tanh one .
first , most of the measurements of @xmath136 reported in @xcite actually refers to @xmath140 with @xmath141 the bias of the galaxy population used to trace the growth factor .
since the bias is related to the underlying gravity theory , a modified lagrangian can in principle introduce deviations from the standard collapse scenario thus leading to a different and possibly scale dependent bias .
second , @xmath136 is sometimes obtained from a preliminary modelling of the matter power spectrum as in @xcite which partially relies on the assumption of a fiducial @xmath36cdm model to convert from the redshift to the real space clustering . while the background expansion is likely the same as the @xmath36cdm one up to intermediate @xmath63 , the modeling of the power spectrum and its distortions can be different so that the inferred @xmath136 estimate should be taken _
cum grano salis_. motivated by these considerations , we prefer to be conservative and consider fig.[fig : gzplot ] as a strong evidence that accelerating @xmath0 models with a quite similar background expansion can be easily discriminated by their growth factor evolution .
interpreting gravitational interactions in terms of the torsion rather than the scalar curvature leads to the equivalent teleparallel formulation of gr . adding a further @xmath0 term into the gravity lagrangian then modifies general relativity allowing for a wider range of possible dynamical behaviour .
in particular , for some particular choices of the @xmath0 functional expression , it is possible to get an accelerating expansion in a matter only universe with the effective torsion fluid playing the role of dark energy .
motivated by these considerations , we have here considered two generalisations of teleparallel models assigned by the expression ( [ eq : ftmods ] ) for the @xmath0 function .
we have convincingly shown that both models are in excellent agreement with a wide set of cosmological data , from the sneia+grb hubble diagram to the @xmath1 measurements , baos and cmbr distance priors .
having been designed to give an accelerated expansion , the parameter space of both models collapses into a region giving rise to a background dynamics similar to the @xmath36cdm one . as a consequence ,
the two models can be hardly discriminated based on the dataset we have used .
it is worth stressing that this is not a limitation of the data , but rather an intrinsic feature of how the models have been worked out . as such , improving the precision of the measurements or increasing the statistics does not help in discriminating among the @xmath0 models and the @xmath36cdm one . on the contrary , one has to resort to different tracers which are related to the evolution of the perturbations , the simplest one being the growth factor @xmath136 . on small scales
, the impact of torsion only introduces a redshift dependent rescaling of the gravitational constant which now becomes @xmath133 .
this only modification considerably changes the growth factor leading to a scaling of @xmath142 with @xmath63 which strongly depend on the @xmath0 model considered .
as fig.[fig : gzplot ] clearly shows , it is easy to discriminate between the two models provided one has a model independent estimate of the growth factor as function of @xmath63 .
however , to this end , one should carefully take into account how the collapse of structures take place in the modified regime introduced by the effective torsion field . to this end ,
the weak field limit of @xmath0 models must be investigated thus also leading to the determination of the gravitational potential on galactic scales and its impact on the galaxy dynamics .    on the largest scales ,
the torsion field modifies the growth of perturbations by altering both the gravitational constant and the friction term @xcite . as a consequence
a richer phenomenology is achieved possibly leading to other ways to discriminate among @xmath0 models and dark energy ones .
two candidate probes are the matter power spectrum @xmath143 and cosmic shear . in the first case ,
the derivation of @xmath143 is likely quite easy to achieve the main deviations from the standard gr one being encoded by the scale dependent growth factor .
however , the comparison with the data asks for two further effects to be taken into account .
first , what we actually observe is the galaxy power spectrum which is related to the matter one through the bias @xmath144 ( if we neglect redshift distortions ) . while for gr models one can assume @xmath144 to be scale independent , this is not guaranteed a priori for @xmath0 models . as a possible way out
, one could rely on a parameterized phenomenological ansatz although this strategy could introduce a degeneracy with the @xmath0 parameters . on smaller scales ,
where @xmath136 is scale independent , nonlinear effects start becoming important so that one should find a way to take them into account .
as far as we know it , a mapping from the linear @xmath143 to the nonlinear one is still unavailable for @xmath0 theories thus preventing a straightforward comparison between predicted and observed @xmath143 .
a somewhat better situation holds for the computation of the cosmic shear power spectrum .
indeed , it probes the full matter distribution along the line of sight and not the clustered component . as such
, the bias plays no role at all so that there is no need to preliminary investigate how galaxy formation takes place in @xmath0 models .
moreover , the cosmic shear power spectrum allows us to probe the largest scales where nonlinear effects may be neglected thus putting more emphasis on the modifications due to the deviations of @xmath0 theory from gr .
we therefore consider cosmic shear as a more promising tool to discriminate among rival teleparallel scenarios and between @xmath0 and gr and deserve a detailed analysis to a forthcoming publication @xcite .

 the cosmic speed up is driven by an effective torsion fluid whose equation of state depend on the @xmath0 function entering the modified gravity lagrangian . 
 we focus on two particular choices for @xmath0 which share the nice property to emulate a phantom divide crossing as suggested by some recent data . 
 we check their viability contrasting the predicted background dynamics to the hubble diagram as traced by both type ia supernovae ( sneia ) and gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) , the measurement of the rate expansion @xmath1 , the baryon acoustic oscillations ( baos ) at different redshifts , and the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) distance priors . 
 both @xmath0 models turn out to be in very good agreement with this large dataset so that we also investigate whether it is possible to discriminate among them relying on the different growth factors . "
"the near - ir molecular hydrogen emission lines are recognised as being important tools in studies of star formation ( shull & beckwith @xcite ) .
the excitation of these lines involves mainly two competing processes : ( i ) shock heating and ( ii ) uv fluorescence ( burton @xcite ) .
it is possible , however , to distinguish between these two processes by measuring the ratios of intensities of lines arising from two different vibrational levels ( sternberg & dalgarno @xcite , hora & latter @xcite ) .
the origin of shocked molecular hydrogen emission from the spatially unresolved region close to the star can originate from outflows or from accretion shocks in a disk , as in the case of infrared companions ( irc s ) ( herbst et al .
@xcite , koresko et al .
rno91(@xmath12)is one of the only two known pms stars in the l43 dark cloud in ophiuchus .
it was classified as a m0.5 type t tauri star by leverault ( @xcite ) , based on an optical spectrum that showed strong h@xmath13 emission .
an outflow driven by this star was identified at millimeter wavelengths and shown to have spatially separated red - shifted and blue - shifted lobes ( leverault @xcite , myers et al .
@xcite , bence et al .
however , optical images and spectra obtained by schild et al .
( @xcite ) showed that the outflow does not have any emission indicative of shocked material around rno91 .
optical and infrared photometry ( u - band to l - band ) was obtained by myers et al.(@xcite ) .
heyer et al . (
@xcite ) obtained the jhk photometry and h - band polarimetry of this object which showed a disk type structure for the first time .
weintraub et al .
( @xcite , hereafter , w94 ) demonstrated by their k - band polarimetric image and 3 - 5 @xmath2 m spectra that rno91 is surrounded by a disk - like structure of radius 1700 au comprising frozen h@xmath0o , co and possibly xcn .
they also showed that the polarization center does not coincide with the intensity peak identified as rno91 .
our speculation that this result indicates an irc to rno91 was quickly laid to rest by the shift and add imaging by aspin et al .
( @xcite ) ( hereafter a97 ) , which does not show any secondary source within a 3.7@xmath4 square region .
in this paper we present near - infrared spectra and narrow band images of the object in the k band region .
we also report the detection of the h@xmath14 @xmath1= 1 - 0 s(1 ) line at the source and discuss its implications .
near infrared spectroscopic observations were made on march 25 , 1998 at gurushikhar 1.2 m infrared telescope ( girt ) , mt .
abu , india . a near infrared camera / grating spectrometer based on a hgcdte @xmath15 focal plane array
was used to obtain the observations .
the grating spectrometer was used in a configuration that yielded a resolving power of @xmath16 = 1000 with a 1@xmath4/pixel plate scale .
the slit was two pixels wide and oriented along the n - s axis .
the atmospheric seeing and image motions were below @xmath17 during the observations , which was measured from imaging data obtained just before the spectroscopic observations .
data acquisition and reduction were done using standard procedures .
we used the rno91 k band photometric fluxes ( 0.48jy ) given by myers et al .
( @xcite ) for flux calibrating the spectrum .
( @xmath18 m ) images through h@xmath0 ( @xmath19 m ) , br@xmath20(@xmath21 m ) and continuum ( @xmath22 m ) filters were obtained by the united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ) service observing program on september 8 , 1998 using the facility near - ir imager ircam3 .
ircam3 employs a @xmath15 insb array ; the optics used gives a pixel scale of 0.280 .
there was a small defocusing problem that occurred during these observations due to variable seeing , resulting in image elongation in the n - e , s - w direction .
these uncertainties were estimated to be about 1.2@xmath4 .
continuum subtraction was not carried out because of the focusing problems in these images .
it should also be noted that there is some ghosting that had occurred in these images . these are identified as ghost images since they occur at exactly the same position with respect to the main source both in object and standard star frames .
the contour map of the spectrum shown in figure 1 displays the extended h@xmath0 emission along the n - s direction ( the slit axis ) corresponding to the outflow axis .
the intensity peaks at -3@xmath4 and + 2@xmath4 represent h@xmath0 knots in the outflow . from gaussian fits to the continuum emission profile at different positions along the dispersion axis , we find that the fwhm of the continuum strip ( measured n - s ) is about 3.0@xmath4 , although the seeing on the night of observation was between 1.5 - 2.0@xmath4 . the extra width in the stellar continuum strip could be attributed to scattered light from the cocoon surrounding the star .
we have therefore extracted the source spectrum by integrating the emission along three and then five rows , representing an on - source area of @xmath23 and @xmath24 .
the relative intensities of the photospheric nai and cai features remained the same in these two extractions .
however , in the @xmath25-wide extraction , the 2.122@xmath2 m line intensity was considerably smaller relative to the photospheric features .
this result confirms that the broadening of the continuum strip is indeed due to scattered star light .
figure 2 shows the spectrum of rno91 in the wavelength region @xmath26 m to @xmath27 m .
the spectrum is obtained by integrating nine rows , covering 9@xmath4 along the n - s slit axis centered around the star .
the spectrum displays prominently the h@xmath0 @xmath1=1 - 0 s(1)line at @xmath28 m and the photospheric nai and cai absorption features at @xmath29 m and @xmath30 m respectively . the 2 - 1 s(1 ) line at 2.247@xmath2 m is below the noise level .
the spectrum also displays the br@xmath20 emission line at 2.167@xmath2 m .
these features are marked in the figure .
most of the other features seen in absorption are telluric in nature ( chelli et al .
@xcite ) .
the excitation mechanism for h@xmath0 emission can be inferred from the 2 - 1 s(1)/1 - 0 s(1 ) flux ratio ( e.g. luhman et al .
@xcite ) . an estimated upper limit to the 2 - 1 s(1 ) line flux yields this ratio to be 0.16 or less , pointing strongly towards shock excitation . however , flourescent excitation in a high density regime may also produce a `` shock - like '' 2 - 1 s(1)/1 - 0 s(1 ) ratio , because of thermalisation of low - energy vibrational levels ( sternberg & dalgarno @xcite , burton et al .
@xcite ) . in a high density region
one would still expect to see emission from the @xmath1=3 level at 10% of the 1 - 0 s(1 ) line ( rather than 1% , as is expected in a shock ; see e.g. luhman et al .
@xcite ) . however , in our spectrum the 3 - 2 s(3 ) line is unresolved from nai absorption , and the 3 - 2 s(1 ) line is outside the wavelength range .
we resolve this issue by estimating the two most crucial parameters that decide the efficiency of the uv fluorescence , namely , the gas number density and the uv flux scaling parameter @xmath31 ( see sternberg and dalgarno @xcite ) .
we estimate an upper limit for the gas number density to be @xmath32 @xmath33 , considering an a@xmath34 9 ( myers et al .
@xcite ) , an outer disk radius of 1700au ( w94 ) , and an inner disk radius of 0.01au corresponding to the dust evaporating radius for an m0 star . note that this density is for a gas disk of 1700au and the actual regions from where we expect the h@xmath0 emission are well below a radius of 200 - 300au . on the other hand ,
the uv flux scaling parameter @xmath31 for an m0 type star is much less than 1 . from these
, the uv fluorescence is expected to be of little significance for the excitation of h@xmath0 lines .
figure 3 shows a narrow band image through h@xmath0 filter , without continuum subtraction . the disk structure and an outflow lobe in the south
can be seen clearly .
these structures are more evident in this narrow band image , than in the earlier k@xmath35 image of hoddap ( @xcite ) or the polarimetric image of w94 .
w94 had shown the existence of frozen h@xmath0o , co and possibly xcn in a disk structure of radius 1700au around rno91 .
the existence of these ices on grains within this disk structure was proven by the absorption features found in a @xmath36 m spectra .
their k - band polarimetric map also conforms with models of scattering from disks ( whitney & hartmann @xcite ) .
w94 suggest a scenario with a flared disk viewed at an angle of @xmath37 with the northern outflow lobe tilted away from the observer . the narrow band image shown in figure 3 (
note specifically the patch of continuum emission to the south of rno91 ) clearly support this scenario .
in addition , it can be seen from fig 1 that the h@xmath0 emission is extended more in the southern direction than in the northern direction which also confirms the tilt of the outflow axis , the northern lobe of the outflow being obscured near the source by the disk structure .
from the spectrum we measure an h@xmath0 flux of 7@xmath38 ergs sec@xmath39 @xmath9 ( integrated over 3 rows , representing an area on - source of @xmath40 ) .
if we attribute this flux to shocks , we can estimate the mass flow rate @xmath41 using the relation    @xmath42    where @xmath43 is the ratio of the total energy in the shock to the strength of the 1 - 0 s(1 ) line , @xmath44 is the observed h@xmath0 line luminosity , and @xmath45 the shock velocity .
we adopt a value for @xmath45 of 30 km s@xmath8 , a value that is optimum for producing h@xmath46 line emission .
we also assume that @xmath47 ( smith @xcite ) .
together , these yield an estimate for mass flux of @xmath48 m@xmath11 yr@xmath8 .    as demonstrated in the previous section , the relative change in the intensity of h@xmath0 from that of the photospheric features in the spectra extracted with different widths of the continuum strip shows that the h@xmath46 emission close to the star likely originates from a region different to that traced by the photospheric lines .
the fact that the h@xmath46 line emission is extended along our n - s slit strongly suggests that the h@xmath46 is associated with an outflow . by observing line emission coincident with the rno91 stellar continuum
, we may therefore be tracing the outflow all the way back to the source . the total flux measured from
the observed extended emission ( integrated over 9 rows representing an area on - source of @xmath49 ) is 1.5@xmath50 ergs sec@xmath39 @xmath9 .
this represents an average flux distribution of 3.5@xmath51 ergs sec@xmath39 @xmath52sr@xmath39 . assuming @xmath53 ( davis & eislffel @xcite ) , the extinction corrected s(1 ) line flux yields a net h@xmath0 luminosity of 0.002l@xmath54 . using the estimated value of @xmath41 and the kinematic age of the outflow
, the h@xmath0 luminosity can be shown to represent a net warm h@xmath0 mass of @xmath55 m@xmath11 , where , a @xmath56 long flow with a velocity of 30 km s@xmath8 is used to calculate the age of the outflow .
the h@xmath46 line flux measured from within the central 3@xmath4 could be associated with the near - ir counterparts of hh knots embedded within the cocoon that are excited by the outflow and accretion shocks in a disk .
however , excitation of all of the observed `` on - source '' h@xmath0 emission due to infall is not feasible , since the mass accretion rates derived from such infall will produce a k - band extinction ( herbst et al .
@xcite ) that is an order of magnitude higher than the measured value by myers et al .
( @xcite ) .
but some fraction of the observed emission could originate from accretion shocks , with the rest from the outflow , as in the case of t tauri .
it is interesting to note that the high resolution images obtained via shift and add imaging at ukirt by a97 reveal a nebulous feature which is about @xmath57 north of the star .
this could be a shock excited feature in the outflow .
alternatively , this feature  in conjunction with the fainter features to the s - w of the star  appears to be part of an ellipse whose major axis is @xmath5 200au as measured by us using the published images of a97 .
in fact these features may be visualized in terms of a disk tilted by 30@xmath58 to the north .
the absence of any feature to the south may be attributed to the obscuration of the disk by the outflow .
these arguments support the w94 data and their model , as do our narrow band images shown in figure 3 .    while gas and dust disks are known to exist around pms stars ( beckwith et al .
@xcite , dutrey et al .
@xcite ) , there exists a small sample of objects with disk structures that contain _ icy mantles _ where ices are found on dust particles in the protostellar envelopes ( see chiar et al . @xcite and references therein ) .
rno91 possesses by far the largest icy gas / dust disk structure ( 20 ) and also shows shocked h@xmath0 originating in an outflow and possibly an accretion disk .
these features make rno91 unique and an interesting object for further studies in millimeter and infrared wavelengths .
an infrared spectrum of rno91 shows emission of shocked molecular hydrogen from an outflow in the n - s direction and from a spatially unresolved region close to rno91 .
we estimate a mass flow rate of @xmath48 m@xmath11 yr@xmath8 , based on the line fluxes from this spatially unresolved region around rno91 .
the line fluxes from the spatially extended outflow yield @xmath59l@xmath11 representing net warm h@xmath0 mass of @xmath60 m@xmath11 .
the outflow seen here in h@xmath0 emission , extending roughly n - s , appears to support the tilted disk @xmath61 outflow model of w94 , where the northern flow lobe is tilted away from us at an angle of @xmath37 to the plane of the sky .
our narrow band images also support this scenario .
we suggest that the h@xmath0 flux from the spatially unresolved region around the source could originate in `` hh - type '' knots embedded in the cocoon surrounding the star .
however , accretion shocks can not entirely be ruled out based on our observations .
we argue that rno91 is a unique disk / outflow system .

 the non - detection of the h@xmath0 @xmath1=2 - 1 s(1 ) line at 2.247@xmath3 m suggests shock excitation rather than fluorescence .

 the line intensity peak ( fwhm @xmath5 3@xmath4 ) corresponds to the star rno91 which is embedded in a cocoon of gas and dust .

"it was realized long ago that dislocations play an important role in determining the mechanical properties of a crystal  whether periodic or not . as a consequence ,
ever since the discovery of quasicrystals much effort has been invested in the experimental and the theoretical study of their dislocations  @xcite , leading to interesting observations such as the special role played by phasons in the motion of dislocations .    here
we study the behavior of dislocations in a model system based on the dynamical equation of lifshitz and petrich  ( * ? ? ? * henceforth lp ) , which is a modification of the well - known swift - hohenberg equation  @xcite .
the dynamics of the lp equation is relaxational , @xmath0 , driving a continuous 2-dimensional density field @xmath1 towards a minimum of the lyapunov functional , or `` effective free energy '' , @xmath2 ^ 2    - \frac13 \rho^3 + \frac14 \rho^4 \bigr\},\ ] ] yielding a dynamical equation of the form @xmath3 among their results , lp showed that if @xmath4 , @xmath5 , or @xmath6 and @xmath7 is sufficiently small , stable steady - state patterns are obtained ( from random initial conditions ) with long - range order and square , hexagonal , or dodecagonal symmetry , respectively .
although the lp equation can not describe the dynamics of real solid - state quasicrystals and is probably more appropriate for soft matter or fluid phenomena such as faraday waves , it offers a unique opportunity for the quantitative study of dislocations in a system  exhibiting both periodic and quasiperiodic long - range order  whose dynamics is exactly known .
the lyapunov functional @xmath8 in  ( [ eq : lyapunov ] ) is clearly invariant under any translation or rotation of space .
the steady - state solutions that are obtained are symmetry - broken ground states of @xmath9 , whose fourier transform has the form @xmath10 where the ( reciprocal ) lattice @xmath11 is a finitely generated @xmath12-module , _ i.e. _ it can be expressed as the set of all integral linear combination of a finite number @xmath13 of @xmath14-dimensional wave vectors . in the special case where @xmath13 , called the rank of the structure , is equal to the physical dimension @xmath14 ( here @xmath15 ) ,
the structure is periodic .
any particular ground state @xmath16 of @xmath8 is _ indistinguishable _ from a whole set of ground states that are related by so - called gauge transformations @xmath17 where @xmath18 , called a _ gauge - function , _ has the property that @xmath19 , possibly to within an additive integer , whenever @xmath20 and @xmath21 are in @xmath11 .
as described in detail by drger and mermin  @xcite , gauge functions form a vector space @xmath22 of all real - valued linear functions on the lattice @xmath11 . because @xmath11 has rank @xmath13 , any linear function is completely specified by giving its values on @xmath13 integrally - independent lattice vectors .
the space @xmath22 is therefore a @xmath13-dimensional vector space over the real numbers .
the space @xmath22 contains , as a subset , all the integral - valued linear functions on @xmath11 , denoted by @xmath23 .
gauge functions in @xmath23 leave the ground - state density invariant .
gauge functions that belong to the quotient space @xmath24 take the ground state described by @xmath25 into a different , yet indistinguishable , ground state described by some other density function @xmath26 .
thus , one can parameterize all the related ground states of @xmath8 on a simple @xmath13-torus  the order parameter space @xmath24 .    ) showing a square and a dodecagonal pattern , a short time after a dislocation has been injected .

top - right : inverse fourier transform of the filterred peaks clearly showing the dislocation.,title='fig:',height=264 ]    with this in mind we can easily construct an arbitrary dislocation in a 2-dimensional periodic or quasiperiodic density .
as we traverse in a loop around the position of the dislocation , say the origin , we locally change the ground state @xmath27 by a gradually varying gauge function which winds around the @xmath28 direction of the @xmath13-torus @xmath29 times , and returns back to the original point .
this is most readily accomplished by using an angle - dependent local gauge function @xmath30 that assigns to the @xmath28 basis vector @xmath31 of @xmath11 the value @xmath32 .
thus , the most general dislocation is characterized by a set of @xmath13 integers ( @xmath33 ) , which for a periodic crystal reduces to the familiar @xmath14-dimensional burgers vector .
not surprisingly , the set of all dislocations forms a rank-@xmath13 @xmath12-module  the so - called homotopy group of the @xmath13-torus  @xcite .
examples of dislocations  injected in this manner into the square and dodecagonal ground states of the lp equation  ( [ lpeqn])are shown in fig .
[ fig : dislocisolate ] after a short relaxation time .    once injected into the structure ,
the positions of dislocations are tracked numerically , as demonstrated in fig .
[ fig : dislocisolate ] , by filtering individual pairs of bragg peaks in the fourier transform , and then performing an inverse fourier transform to visualize the dislocations present in each individual density wave .
this allows us to follow the positions of the dislocations in real time and obtain quantitative measurements of their velocities as described below .    .

we apply external stress on a structure , containing a single dislocation , by squeezing it in a particular direction and then allowing it to evolve under the dynamics of the lp equation .
we quantify the amount of stress by the change @xmath37 in the wavenumber of the fundamental density wave in the direction of the applied stress , relative to its wavenumber in the relaxed steady - state density .
we have calculated elsewhere  @xcite , using the approach of siggia and zippelius  @xcite and of tesauro and cross  @xcite , that under such circumstances , with the parameters used in our simulations , the dislocation should climb with a velocity which is linear in the stress @xmath37 and is proportional to the parameter @xmath36 , playing the role of a generalized diffusion coefficient .
this should be contrasted with the fact that for dynamics governed by the swift - hohenberg equation  @xcite the climb velocity is proportional to @xmath38 , for the same simulation parameters .
[ fig : results ] summarizes our measurements of dislocation velocities , obtained using the automatic numerical procedure for tracking the dislocation , described above .
[ fig : results](a ) shows the position of a dislocation as a function of time for different values of stress @xmath37 , as measured under the dynamics of the lp equation for a dodecagonal pattern . for sufficiently large values of the diffusion constant
@xmath36 the dislocation climbs at a relatively constant speed , which indeed varies linearly with the applied stress , as shown in fig .

[ fig : results](c ) compares the measurements for different steady - state solutions of the lp equation .
we find that the stripe pattern is the easiest for dislocation climb , with the climb velocity @xmath39 , and that the square pattern is the most resistant , with @xmath40 .
interestingly , the proportionality constants for the hexagonal and the dodecagonal patterns are very similar , with @xmath41 .
a possible explanation might be that the two triplets of wave vectors making up the dodecagonal pattern , act independently as two hexagonal patterns during the climb process .
top : irregular pinning of a dilocation in a dodecagonal pettern due to the lack of periodicity.,width=377 ]    as the value of the diffusion constant @xmath36 decreases the local features of the pattern become important and the dislocation no longer climbs at a constant rate . in a periodic pattern , such as the square or hexagonal densities , the motion of the dislocation nearly comes to a stop at regularly spaced positions , or pinning sites , as shown at the bottom of fig .
[ fig : pinning ] .
these sites correspond to positions where peaks in the density must first be annihilated before the dislocation can continue in its climb . in the quasiperiodic dodecagonal pattern
a qualitatively different behavior occurs in which the dislocation is pinned at irregular intervals , as shown at the top of fig .
[ fig : pinning ] .
it seems likely that because the quasiperiodic pattern contains different local environments the dislocation is more strongly pinned at certain sites than others , and these sites never quite repeat .

 dislocation dynamics in a dodecagonal quasiperiodic structure "
"the _ quasihyperbolic metric _ in @xmath3 is a generalization of the hyperbolic metric .
this metric was first studied in @xmath3 by gehring in joint publications @xcite with his students palka and osgood in late 1970 s . since its discovery , the quasihyperbolic
metric has been widely applied in the study of geometric function theory @xcite . at the same time , many basic questions of the quasihyperbolic geometry have remained open . only very recently
several authors have studied questions such as convexity of balls of small radii , uniqueness of geodesics , and quasihyperbolic trigonometry of plane domains .
see for instance @xcite .
we refer to @xcite for the basic properties of this metric in @xmath4    in banach spaces , the properties of the quasihyperbolic metric were first studied by visl in a series of articles in 1990 s @xcite .
the quasihyperbolic metric is a crucial tool for studying quasiconformal mappings in the in finite dimensional banach spaces because quasiconformality is defined in terms of it .
moreover , the basic tools of the finite dimensional theory in @xmath3 , such as the conformal modulus and finite dimensional measure theory , are not available in the case of infinite dimensional banach spaces .
see @xcite for discussion and motivations on the topic .
a result of gehring and osgood shows that in domains of @xmath3 there is always a quasihyperbolic geodesic between any two points @xcite .
it was proved by martin in @xcite , that the geodesics of the quasihyperbolic metric in @xmath3 are smooth .
the proof makes use of mbius transformations , and it does not work in the banach space setting . in this paper ,
our aim is to generalize these results to the banach space setting .
a result of martio and visl @xcite shows that if @xmath0 is a convex domain of a uniformly convex banach space , then each pair of points @xmath5 is joined by a unique quasihyperbolic geodesic .
the existence argument is based on the fact that each uniformly convex banach space is reflexive and the unit ball of reflexive space is compact in the weak topology .
the geodesic is obtained from a sequence of short paths .
the first of our main results , theorem [ main1 ] , shows by following the arguments of our earlier paper @xcite that in a convex domain @xmath0 of a reflexive strictly convex banach space the quasihyperbolic geodesics are unique .
the argument boils down to taking averages of paths .
we also prove by a counterexample that there does not necessarily exist any quasihyperbolic geodesics between any two points in a convex domain of a non - reflexive banach space .
this appears a somewhat surprising fact and it settles a problem posed in @xcite in the negative .
finally , we show that quasihyperbolic geodesics in a uniformly convex banach space , with a power type modulus of convexity , are @xmath6 smooth .
this result generalizes a classical theorem of martin @xcite in the euclidean setting , as well as visl s recent work in hilbert spaces @xcite .      here
we consider banach spaces @xmath2 over the real field .
we refer to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for suitable background information .
suppose that @xmath2 is a banach space with @xmath7 , and let @xmath8 be an open path - connected domain .
we call a continuous function @xmath9 a _
weight function_. then the _ @xmath10-length _ of a rectifiable arcs @xmath11 is defined by @xmath12 we also define a ( conformal ) metric @xmath13 on @xmath0 by @xmath14 where the infimum is taken over rectifiable arcs @xmath15 joining @xmath16 and @xmath17 in @xmath0 .
it is clear that @xmath18 defines a metric in @xmath0 .
if the infimum is attained for an arc @xmath15 , then we call @xmath15 a _ @xmath18-geodesic_. it is easy to see that @xmath18-geodesics do not always exist .    for the weight function @xmath19 we denote @xmath20 , and call @xmath21 the quasihyperbolic metric of @xmath0 .
the open quasihyperbolic balls are given by @xmath22    a set @xmath23 is called _ convex _ if the line segment @xmath24 : = \ { tx + ( 1-t)y : t\in [ 0,1]\ } \subset \omega\textrm { for all } x , y\in\omega.\ ] ] note that the use of notation @xmath25 $ ] here is different from some texts dealing with banach spaces . the norm of a banach space is said to be _ strictly convex _ if the unit sphere contains no proper line segment , i.e. @xmath26 for @xmath27 .
the _ modulus of convexity _
@xmath28 is defined by @xmath29 a banach space @xmath2 is called _ uniformly convex _ if @xmath30 for @xmath31 ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) .
a space @xmath2 is uniformly convex of power type @xmath32 if @xmath33 for some @xmath34 .
for example any reflexive @xmath35 space has this property .    a banach space @xmath2 is said to have the _ radon - nikodym property _ ( rnp ) if the radon - nikodym theorem holds for @xmath2 .
that is , if each banach - valued measure @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is a sigma algebra and @xmath38 , has the representation @xmath39 for all @xmath40 and some bochner integrable @xmath41 .
all reflexive spaces and separable dual spaces have the rnp .
for example , the space @xmath42 of sequences converging to @xmath43 with the @xmath44-norm fails the rnp .
a path @xmath45\to { \mathrm{x}}$ ] is differentiable at @xmath46 if @xmath47 this derivative is denoted by @xmath48 .
a banach space @xmath2 has the rnp if and only if each absolutely continuous path @xmath45\to { \mathrm{x}}$ ] is differentiable a.e . in such a case
the fundamental theorem of analysis holds : @xmath49 where the integral is taken in the bochner sense .
we say that path @xmath50\to { \mathrm{x}}$ ] is @xmath6-smooth if the derivative @xmath48 exists and is continuous away from the endpoints @xmath51 and @xmath52 ( where the derivative is not defined in the usual sense ) .
a _ geodesic _ is a path in a metric space which has the least path length among the paths connecting its endpoints .
we call a metric space _ geodesic _ if each pair of points can be joined by a geodesic ( not necessarily unique ) .
in general domains the quasihyperbolic geodesics need not be unique . a simple example is the space punctured at a point . for the uniqueness one needs additional assumptions such as convexity .
another related topic is the convexity of balls with small radii which was recently proved by kln in the special case of the punctured space @xcite , and by visl @xcite for general plane domains .    by following the arguments in @xcite
one can check the following :    [ main1 ] in a convex domain @xmath0 of a strictly convex banach space with the rnp the quasihyperbolic geodesics are unique .
the existence of geodesics in the reflexive case was given by visl in @xcite .
for a path @xmath45\to \omega$ ] and @xmath53 $ ] denote by @xmath54 the quasihyperbolic length of @xmath55)$ ] .
we write @xmath56 for @xmath57 .
suppose that @xmath58 \to \omega$ ] are two different quasihyperbolic geodesics connecting points @xmath5 . then @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 .
we will use the argument in the proof of @xcite but here the situation is a bit easier , since the geodesics are assumed to exist .
we may assume that @xmath62.\ ] ] for @xmath63 $ ] , we define the average path @xmath64 by the formula @xmath65    now suppose that @xmath66 , @xmath67 are points such that for some @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 .
as in @xcite , we obtain the estimate @xmath71    on the other hand , by a similar argument , we have @xmath72,\ ] ] and thus equality holds in .
it follows that the boundary of the quasihyperbolic ball @xmath73 contains a line segment @xmath74 $ ] .
this is a contradiction because in the proof of ( * ? ? ?
* theorem 4.1 ) it was established that the inequality ( * ? ? ?
* ( 4.6 ) ) is strict in a strictly convex banach space with the rnp , and thus , the quasihyperbolic balls are strictly convex ( cf .
the proof of ( * ? ? ? * theorem 2.3 ) ) .
similarly as in the argument in @xcite we see that if the distance function @xmath75 is strictly concave ( excluding possibly finitely many points of the space ) , then the qh geodesics are unique .
as mentioned previously , it is known that in any convex domain of a reflexive space there is always a geodesic between two points .
if the space has the property of being strictly convex ( with respect to a given norm ) , then the geodesic is unique .
it turns out here , somewhat surprisingly , that if one removes the reflexivity assumption , then the statement does not remain valid , even for half spaces .
[ thm : non ] let @xmath76 , @xmath77 and we consider @xmath0 in the quasihyperbolic metric . given any pair of distinct points @xmath5 there is no geodesic between them .
denote by @xmath78 the dual of a banach space @xmath2 .
first , let us recall the following well - known fact :    [ fact1 ] let @xmath79 and @xmath80
. then @xmath81 .
it suffices to check the claim in the case @xmath82 .
given @xmath83 , there is @xmath84 with @xmath85 and @xmath86 .
writing @xmath87 for some @xmath88 we observe that @xmath89 on the other hand , if @xmath90 , then there exists @xmath91 and @xmath92 such that @xmath93 .
this is impossible , since @xmath94 and @xmath95 by the assumptions .    without loss of generality we may assume , by rotating the coordinates if necessary , that @xmath96 is coordinatewise non - negative .
we may also assume that @xmath95 .
observe that @xmath97 for @xmath98 according to fact [ fact1 ] .
we denote by @xmath99 the infinite subset of indices @xmath100 such that @xmath101 .
fix @xmath102 .
assume to the contrary to the statement of the theorem that @xmath45\to \omega$ ] is a quasihyperbolic geodesic joining @xmath16 and @xmath17 .
let @xmath103 be such that @xmath104 .
by symmetry we may assume that this difference is positive .
we write @xmath105 .
we may assume that @xmath15 is parametrized by its norm length .
clearly @xmath106 .
next we define a sequence @xmath107 of modifications of @xmath15 for @xmath108 .
let @xmath109 be the functional given by @xmath110 for each @xmath111 .
for each @xmath103 , let @xmath112\to { \mathbb{r}}$ ] be the polygonal line defined by the following conditions : @xmath113 and @xmath114 .
note that the absolute value of the slope of @xmath115 is @xmath116 ( which is defined for values @xmath117 ) .
we let @xmath118 be such that @xmath119 for @xmath120 , @xmath121 $ ] and @xmath122 for @xmath123 and @xmath121 $ ] ( see figure [ fig3 ] ) .
projected on a single coordinate.,width=377 ]    _ claim : _ the inequality @xmath124 holds for @xmath125 .
indeed , by approximation it suffices to check that the above claim holds in the case where @xmath15 is a polygonal line with finitely many , say , @xmath126 line segments .
this , in turn , reduces to studying such paths supported in only finitely many , say , @xmath100 first coordinates .
denote by @xmath127\subset c_0 $ ] the corresponding subspace .
since @xmath128 is reflexive , being finite - dimensional , it possesses the rnp , and thus we may consider @xmath129 since the path @xmath15 is a polygonal line having only finitely many supporting coordinates and line segments , we may find a finite decomposition @xmath130 of @xmath131 $ ] in such a way that @xmath132 for all @xmath133 $ ] or @xmath134 for all @xmath133 $ ] ( or both ) for each @xmath135 .
recall that the norm in @xmath128 is @xmath136 . by using that @xmath137 for a.e .
@xmath138 we obtain the claim .
note that @xmath139 for each @xmath140 and @xmath138 , by the construction of the paths @xmath141 .
thus , by applying the above claim we obtain @xmath142 for @xmath140 , since @xmath143 is exactly the quasihyperbolic weight of a path @xmath15 .
moreover , since @xmath76 and @xmath144 and @xmath145 as @xmath146 it follows that @xmath147 this means that @xmath148 for @xmath140 large enough .
this provides us with a contradiction , since @xmath15 was assumed to be a geodesic .
suppose that @xmath2 is a banach space with @xmath7 , and let @xmath8 be an open path - connected domain .
recall that a domain @xmath0 is geodesic if for every pair of points @xmath5 there exists a geodesic connecting @xmath16 and @xmath17 .
we conjecture that a strictly convex banach space is reflexive if and only if each of its open half spaces is geodesic in the quasihyperbolic metric .
as it was established above , the only if direction holds ( since reflexivity implies the rnp ) .    in the non - strictly convex case the geodesics of half spaces need not be unique , even in finite dimensional setting .
for example , let @xmath149 ( with the @xmath44-norm ) .
then the straight line between @xmath150 and @xmath151 is a quasihyperbolic geodesic .
note that the polygonal line between these two points passing through @xmath152 is also a quasihyperbolic geodesic .    without giving a proof
we note that the above half - space example on @xmath153 can be modified in such a way that the banach space can be taken to be even strictly convex .
indeed , a well - known equivalent strictly convex norm @xmath154 on @xmath153 is given by @xmath155 and @xmath156 can be selected in such a way that + @xmath157 .
note that @xmath158 , so that @xmath159 .
the modulus of convexity @xmath160 of banach space is not necessarily convex .
however , it has a largest convex minorant @xmath116 .
it is easy to see that this is strictly positive if @xmath160 is such .
in what follows we will use the greatest convex minorant @xmath116 in the place of @xmath160 .
a modulus of convexity @xmath161 is said to have a power type if there is @xmath162 such that @xmath163 for some @xmath164 .
in such a case we will apply the convex lower bound @xmath165 in place of @xmath161 .
see also figure [ fig1 ] .
[ thm : ] let @xmath2 be a uniformly convex banach space whose modulus of convexity has a power type .
let @xmath13 be as above .
we assume that @xmath10 is hlder continuous on compact sets .
then every @xmath13-geodesic @xmath15 is @xmath6 excluding the endpoints .
we will first give some auxiliary facts before the proof of the theorem .
in what follows @xmath171 and @xmath172 are i.i.d . @xmath2-valued random variables with @xmath173 a.s .
in particular , these random variables have ( finite ) expectations .
since @xmath171 and @xmath172 are independent , we may consider @xmath176 , where @xmath177 and @xmath178 support the corresponding random variables .
observe that @xmath179 where the inequality follows from jensen s inequality , since @xmath180 .
since the image of @xmath15 is compact , its distance to the boundary @xmath184 is strictly positive , say @xmath185 .
let @xmath186 ^ 2 \times [ 0,1]\colon s\leq t\}\to { \mathrm{x}},\ ] ] @xmath187 note that this is a uniformly continuous mapping and that the preimage @xmath188))<d/2)\ ] ] is an open neighborhood of the subset @xmath189 ^ 2 \times [ 0,1]\colon \}$ ] .
since @xmath15 is parameterized by its norm - length , it follows that @xmath190 is uniformly continuous and therefore there is @xmath191 such that @xmath192,\ p\in [ 0,1],\ 0\leq r\leq r_0\}\\ \subset   t^{-1}(\{x\in { \mathrm{x}}\colon { \mathrm{dist}}(x,\gamma([a , b]))<d/2).\end{gathered}\ ] ]
let @xmath193 be the image of the left hand set under the mapping @xmath190 ( see figure [ fig4 ] ) .
note that @xmath193 is a compact set as a continuous image of one .
since @xmath2 has the rnp , being reflexive , we can recover @xmath15 by bochner integrating its ( vector - valued ) derivative @xmath48 . by the parameterization of @xmath15 we have that @xmath194 a.e . define @xmath195\times
[ 0,1]\to { \mathrm{x}}$ ] by @xmath196\cap [ t - h , t+h]}\gamma'(s)\ ds}{m([a , b]\cap [ t - h , t+h])}\quad \mathrm{for}\

@xmath138 . thus , without loss of generality may assume by redefining @xmath48 that these coincide everywhere and we write @xmath201 .
therefore it suffices to check that @xmath204}\|t_{h}(t)-\gamma'(t)\|=0\ ] ] for any closed interval @xmath205\subset ( a , b)$ ] because then @xmath48 will be continuous on @xmath205 $ ] and the statement of the theorem follows . to this end , we are actually required to verify that @xmath206 , considered as mappings @xmath205\to { \mathrm{x}}$ ] , form a cauchy sequence in @xmath207,{\mathrm{x}})$ ] .
it suffices to establish an estimate @xmath208 where @xmath209 tends to @xmath43 suitably rapidly as @xmath210 ( not depending on @xmath211 $ ] ) .
indeed , we will check that @xmath206 is @xmath207,{\mathrm{x}})$]-cauchy .
note that @xmath212 now @xmath213 is cauchy , since @xmath214 where the convergence of the right hand sum will be established subsequently .      put @xmath216 and observe that ( see figure [ fig5 ] ) @xmath217 for @xmath218 , @xmath198\subset [ a , b]$ ] .
note that @xmath219 is hlder continuous and let @xmath220 be the modulus of continuity of @xmath219 .
thus @xmath221 for some @xmath222 and @xmath223 as @xmath224 .
since @xmath15 is a @xmath13-geodesic we have that @xmath225 the above estimate uses the facts that @xmath226 for @xmath227 and @xmath228 for @xmath229 .
note that @xmath230 defines a straight line @xmath231 $ ] and @xmath232 is the length of the line .
it follows that @xmath233 for a suitable @xmath234 and sufficiently small @xmath202 .
note that since @xmath193 is compact the weight @xmath10 attains its minimum on @xmath193 which must be greater than @xmath43 . in what follows
we will consider only @xmath235 such that the last inequality above holds .
for convenience we will abbreviate the last term of the above inequality by @xmath236
.      therefore on @xmath198 $ ] the path @xmath15 has @xmath240-asymptotically the same length as its linear approximation @xmath230 , @xmath241 $ ] .
this is controlled by @xmath242 .
the philosophy is that if the space is uniformly convex then @xmath15 is heavily penalized for squiggling around its linear approximation .
we will justify by using and the modulus of uniform convexity .
to finish the argument , let us consider the state space @xmath198 ^ 2 $ ] with the probability measure @xmath243 put @xmath244 and @xmath245 and of course we implicitly assume these random variables depend on @xmath138 and @xmath235 , although the estimates depend on @xmath235 only . according to we obtain that @xmath246 so that @xmath247 according to lemma [ lm : ed ] .
here we used the lemma with @xmath248 , which is convex since we may take @xmath162 .
thus @xmath249 so that by applying lemma [ lm : jensen ] we get @xmath250 the last equality being a definition .
observe that @xmath251 converges as a geometric series with ratio @xmath252 .
we note that @xmath253 so that we have verified and .
we call a curve @xmath254 a _ local geodesic _ if for each @xmath255 the restriction @xmath256}$ ] is a geodesic between @xmath257 and @xmath258 .

"a classical nova eruption ( see @xcite for a review ) is a thermonuclear runaway in a cataclysmic variable ( cv ; a semi - detached binary in which a white dwarf primary accretes from a late - type , usually m dwarf , secondary ) .
the runaway is caused when @xmath0 m@xmath1 of hydrogen - rich gas is accreted onto the white dwarf surface ; this material becomes degenerate , until the pressure and temperature at the base of this envelope starts the runaway reaction .
a nova eruption ejects most of the accreted envelope . after a poorly known recurrence time
( 10@xmath2  10@xmath3 years ) , the underlying binary accumulates enough fresh fuel to erupt again .
novae are of interest to nuclear astrophysicists ; they are useful as extragalactic distance indicators ; they play a role in galactic chemical evolution ; and they are likely sources of @xmath4-rays . to understand a nova , it is essential to study the underlying system away from its eruption .
conversely , the study of nova eruptions is essential to understand the secular evolution of cvs .
the subject of this paper , dq  herculis ( nova herculis 1934 ) , has played a key historical role in the studies of nova eruptions and of post - nova binaries ( hereafter old novae ) due to its brightness and fortuitous viewing geometry . the 1934 classical nova eruption of dq  her  reached @xmath5 and enabled extensive observations ( see @xcite for a review ) .
the discovery of eclipses in dq  her  @xcite was pivotal in establishing the standard picture of cvs .
@xcite also discovered the coherent 71 sec photometric oscillation : we now understand that dq  her  contains a magnetic white dwarf , accreting onto the magnetic polar regions which are offset from the rotational poles , i.e. , an oblique rotator .
the ejecta of the 1934 eruption are visible in h@xmath6 and other emission lines as an elliptical shell : as of 1978 , 43 years after the eruption , the equatorial and polar radii ( expansion velocities ) of the dq  her  shell were @xmath7 arcsec ( @xmath8 kms@xmath9 ) and @xmath10 arcsec ( @xmath11 kms@xmath9 ) , respectively @xcite .
they found no evidence for a deceleration of the expansion , and derived a revised distance estimate of 561@xmath1219 pc ( we use this value throughout this paper ) .
this makes dq  her  among the nearest old novae known . by 1995 september ( 61 years after eruption ) , the equatorial and polar radii have grown to @xmath13 arcsec and @xmath14 arcsec , respectively , still consistent with no deceleration , according to our analysis of an archival _ hubble space telescope _
wfpc2 image .    the eclipsing nature of dq  her  in principle allows us to place tight constraints on its system parameters .
the optical eclipse width , measured from mid - ingress to mid - egress as is customary , is 0.110@xmath120.003 cycles ( as compiled from literature by @xcite ) . assuming that the source of eclipsed light is centered on the white dwarf , this can be used to constrain the relationship between the mass ratio @xmath15 ( where @xmath16 and @xmath17 denote the masses of the white dwarf and the mass donor , respectively ) and the inclination angle @xmath18 .
@xcite measured the radial velocity amplitude of the secondary @xmath19 through the detection of the nai infrared doublet absorption lines .
this , combined with the eclipse width and the @xmath20 from literature , have led to their estimates of @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 m@xmath1 , and @xmath24 m@xmath1 .
about 20 x - ray bright cvs with coherent spin modulations have been discovered since the late 1970s , and are classified as intermediate polars ( ips ) or dq  her   stars @xcite .
they are among the brightest cvs in the 210 kev band , with luminosities generally in excess of @xmath25 ergss@xmath9 .
however , the prototype dq  her  was _ not _ detected in an _
einstein _
imaging proportional counter ( ipc ) observation with a 2@xmath26 upper limit of 0.0046 cts@xmath9 @xcite .
one of their hypotheses , that high inclination may be the cause of this non - detection , found support in a model of the phase shifts of the 71-s oscillation during eclipse @xcite . in this model
, a beam of high energy photons originating on the white dwarf is reprocessed by the accretion disk and results in the optical oscillation .
@xcite finds a good fit at @xmath27 , although the actual value of @xmath18 can be lower , as long as the entire front half of the disk including the white dwarf is obscured by the outer edge of the disk .
such permanent obscuration of the white dwarf would greatly reduce the x - rays reaching earth .    despite the high inclination angle ,
x - rays were detected from dq  her  with the _ rosat _  position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ; @xcite ) .
the inferred luminosity ( 0.12.0 kev ) of @xmath28 ergss@xmath9 is modest for an ip .
we note that , using a thermal plasma model with @xmath29 kev with n@xmath30=1.0 @xmath31 @xmath32 , consistent with the pspc spectrum , and the revised distance of 561 pc ( both are different from the values assumed by @xcite ) , the _ einstein _  ipc upper limit corresponds to 2.8 @xmath33 ergss@xmath9 in the ipc band ( 0.44 kev ) , or 3.3 @xmath33 ergss@xmath9 in the 0.12.0 kev band .
these numbers may reflect source variability or the limit of accuracy of cross - instrument comparisons ; neither would be surprising .
a deep eclipse is not observed , consistent with the permanent obscuration of the white dwarf , suggesting an alternative origin of the observed x - rays .
although @xcite considered a likely origin to be the secondary , it has to be emitting x - rays at significantly above the saturation limit ( @xmath34 l@xmath35 , or a few times 10@xmath36 ergs@xmath9 in this case ) seen in rapidly rotating late type dwarfs ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . if not the secondary , what is the origin of the soft x - rays observed from dq  her ?    only @xmath37150 photons were detected in the _ rosat _  observation , insufficient for further progress .
we have therefore secured a _
chandra _
x - ray observatory advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) observation of dq  her .
we describe the observation and data reduction in  2 , present the results in  3 , and discuss the implications in  4 .
we observed dq  her  with _ chandra _
@xcite acis without a grating , placing the object on the back - illuminated s3 chip .
the observations were performed as two pointings , one from 2001 july 26 13:00 ut to july 27 02:31 ut and the other from 2001 july 29 17:09 ut to july 30 02:27 ut , for a total integration time of 68.8 ksec .
these observations were performed at near identical pointing positions and roll angles .
we took the outputs from the processing pipeline at the _ chandra _  x - ray center , and extracted images , spectra , and light curves from these observations individually , before combining the results .
we detect a source at ra = 18h07m30.24s , dec=+45d51m32.6s using the ciao routine celldetect .
although this is offset by 1.7@xmath38 from the position of dq  her  given in @xcite , this is likely to reflect the limitation of comparison of positions measured using different astrometric reference frames ( downes 2002 , private communication ) .
we identify this x - ray source with dq  her  based on this positional coincidence and based on the orbital variability ( see  3.2 below ) .
we extracted source spectra and light curves from a 5 arcsec radius circular region , and background from an annulus of 40 arcsec outer radius and 20 arcsec inner radius centered on the source .
the size of the background annulus is chosen to exclude the nova shell emission ( see  3.3 ) .
the source count rate is 0.025 ctss@xmath9 ( 3 @xmath33 ergss@xmath9 in the 0.25 kev band , based on the spectral model discussed below ) , while the background in the source region ( scaled from the counts in the background region by the detector areas ) is estimated to be 8.2@xmath39 ctss@xmath9 .
dq  her  did not show a significant difference in count rate between the two observations .
there is a bump in the observed acis - s spectrum of dq  her  around 1 kev ( left panel , figure 1 ) which is not in the instrument response . because of this , the spectrum can not be fitted with smooth continuum models ( power - law , bremsstrahlung or black body ) alone . using models of optically thin thermal plasma emission , such as mekal @xcite
, the 1 kev bump is interpreted as a complex of lines in the 0.61.2 kev range , notably lines of oviii ( 0.64 kev ) , fexvii ( 0.73 & 0.83 kev ) , and neix ( 0.90 kev ) .
these lines , however , are weaker relative to the continuum than the predictions of single - temperature plasma models .
moreover , the continuum above 2 kev is much stronger than expected for plasma temperatures that give rise to these lines ( kt@xmath370.6 kev ) . as a result
, a single component mekal model fit also fails to reproduce the observed spectrum .    the simplest successful representation ( @xmath40=1.4 ; see figure 1 ) is a two - component model consisting of kt=0.59@xmath120.04 kev mekal plasma model plus a power law of photon index 2.7@xmath120.2 , with n@xmath30  = 2.9 @xmath41 @xmath32 .
the power - law component in our model provides the added continuum necessary to achieve an acceptable fit , both near the lines ( 0.81.2 kev ) and at higher energies ( 25 kev ) .
inferred intrinsic flux in the 0.25 kev band is 8.2 @xmath42 ergs@xmath32s@xmath9 , or a luminosity of 3.1 @xmath33 ergss@xmath9 .
dq  her  was not significantly detected above 5.0 kev ( we obtain a count rate and an estimated 1@xmath26 error in the 58 kev band of @xmath43 ctss@xmath9 ) , although this is in part due to the lower effective area of the _ chandra _  acis instrument at high energies .
we take @xmath44 ctss@xmath9 as our upper limit , which corresponds to @xmath45 ergss@xmath9 assuming a power law spectral shape with a photon index of 2 and a source distance of 561 pc .
note , however , that our adopted model for the spectrum is not unique .
given the modest number of detected photons ( @xmath371700 ) , and instrumental limitations ( both in bandpass and in spectral resolution ) , there can be a wide range of models that fit the data .
we are only confident that dq  her  shows a spectral feature around 1 kev which mimics a collisionally excited , optically - thin plasma of kt@xmath370.6 kev .
the presence of such a plasma would also lead to a si line at 1.85 kev , which may also be present in the data .
consequently , spectral modeling alone of the _ chandra _  data is insufficient to uncover the origin of the soft x - rays in dq  her .
we show , in figure 2 , the acis light curve of dq  her  folded on the orbital ephemeris of @xcite into 16 bins per cycle .
the ephemeris has an estimated accuracy of @xmath1211 s for this epoch ( see  4.1 for further details ) . a partial eclipse , lasting for about 3 bins and about 30% deep , is clearly seen .
in this representation , the x - ray eclipse center appears to be offset from the ephemeris prediction by one half of the bin size , i.e. , 0.03 cycle or 500 s. moreover , the x - ray eclipse appears to be wider ( 3 bins , or 0.1875 cycles ) than the optical eclipse ( 0.110@xmath120.003 , according to a compilation in @xcite ) , which should be 2 bins in figure 2 .    to quantify this impression ,
we have fit the 32 bin per cycle version of the light curve using a piecewise linear function with symmetric ingress and egress ; we show our best - fit model in figure 2 .
the eclipse center is found to be at phase 0.033@xmath46 ( 90% confidence ) , confirming the offset .
however , the eclipse width ( mid - ingress to mid - egress ) is measured to be 0.18@xmath47 ( 90% ) cycle , thus we can not claim that the x - ray eclipse is definitely wider than in the optical .
in addition to the formal uncertainties , there is additional uncertainty arising from our choice of specific model , thus both these numbers need confirmation .
our _ chandra _  data are of insufficient quality for us to be able to derive further details of the eclipse profile , such as ingress / egress durations .      at first glance , the _ chandra _  acis image of dq  her  looks like that of a point source .
indeed , over 70% of the flux is contained within 1 arcsec ( @xmath37560 au , or 8.4@xmath48 cm ) of the image centroid , as expected for a soft point source .
however , a closer inspection of the image shows that there is a region about 2 arcsec by 2 arcsec in area and about 10 arcsec ne of the point source with more photons ( 28 ) than are expected by chance ( @xmath378 ) .
these excess counts appear equally distributed over this area , and does not display the sharply peaked core of the point spread function ( psf ) expected of a point source .    we have investigated this further by constructing radial profiles of the acis image of dq  her  in several energy bands .
we then fit a model consisting of a flat background plus the psf available in the _ chandra _   calibration database ( interpolated in energy and off - axis angle as appropriate ) .
we find notable excesses in the azimuthally - averaged radial profiles in the 0.20.5 and 0.50.8 kev bands ( figure 3 ; we find no significant features at energies above 0.8 kev , although this may in part due to poor counting statistics ) .
the statistical significance of this is unfortunately difficult to establish : our experiences with other bright sources is that psf fit is usually less than perfect because of effects of pile - up , background non - uniformity , uncertainties in the point source location , and imperfect calibration of the psf .
however , the structures ( clusters of several points above the best fit models ) seen in the radial profiles of dq  her  is unusual .
the two features marked with horizontal bars ( one at 59 arcsec in the 0.20.5 kev band , and another at 810 arcsec in the 0.50.8 kev band ) contain 18.0@xmath124.6 and 12.2@xmath124.1 counts , respectively .
other possible features either have too few photons ( the 67 arcsec bin in the 0.50.8 kev profile has 5 ) or outside the optically detected nova shell ( 1220 arcsec excess in the 0.20.5 kev profile ) and will not be discussed further . for the two features , we also construct an azimuthal histogram in 30 degree bins of photons falling within the appropriate radial and energy bins .
we plot this in the insets of figure 3 as a histogram in polar coordinates ( the position angle on the graph corresponds to the position angle on the sky , and radial distance from the center is proportional to the number of photons in that bins ) .
we find that the 0.20.5 kev feature is about 8 arcsec away s  sw of dq  her , while the 0.50.8 kev feature is about 9 arcsec away ne of the binary .
the folded x - ray light curve appears to be offset from the ephemeris prediction by about 0.03 cycles , or 500 s. the phase offset is greater than 0.006 cycles , or 100 s , at 90% confidence level .
our check of the data reduction processes ( such as the barycentric correction ) has not revealed any potential systematics that could account for such a large offset .
the linear ephemeris , taken from @xcite , has a nominal error of 11 s for this epoch .
moreover , their linear and quadratic ephemerides have diverged by less than 15 s. even though a long - term sinusoidal modulation in o@xmath49c eclipse timings has been found @xcite , the magnitude of this effect is 70 s. thus , we believe that the phase offset likely does not result from an inaccurate ephemeris .    instead , we consider it likely that the phase shift of the x - ray light curve is caused by departure from axial symmetry of the dq  her  system .
we see a considerable scatter in the times of the optical eclipse , up to 170 s in the o@xmath49c timings , although some of it can be modeled by the sinusoidal term ( see figure 4 of @xcite ) . moreover , the eclipse light curves ( see their figure 1 ) are obviously skewed , with ingress beginning around phase @xmath490.08 and egress completing around phase + 0.12 .
this clearly demonstrates the departure from axisymmetry of the eclipsed object .
we might still argue that the deepest point in the eclipse light curve marks the position of the unseen white dwarf . however , this is not necessarily the case , particularly if the eclipsed object is the back side of an asymmetric accretion disk @xcite .
interestingly , the radial velocity study of the secondary , using the nai infrared doublet , shows that the inferior conjunction of the secondary is at phase 0.013@xmath120.009 on the eclipse ephemeris @xcite . this possible phase offset between the radial velocity curve of the secondary and the optical eclipse
should be studied further . in any case
, a non - axisymmetric disk can result in a phase offset between the optical and x - ray eclipses .
our best - fit x - ray eclipse width is also larger than the optical eclipse width , although in this case they can be equal within 90% confidence limits .
we do not necessarily expect the two to be equal , since the model of @xcite for the phase shift of the 71-s oscillations suggests that the emission - weighted center of eclipsed light is somewhere on the back half of the accretion disk , not centered on the white dwarf .
if true , the inclination angle @xmath18 derived with the latter assumption @xcite would be an underestimate for a given @xmath50 .
we can not solve this difficulty with the data in hand , so we treat this as an extra source of uncertainty in the analysis to follow .      at this inclination , a partial eclipse is a signature of an extended emission region . any x - ray emission or scattering from the surface of the accretion disk should be as deeply eclipsed as the optical light from the disk .
since the x - ray eclipse is much shallower than in the optical , we conclude that the x - rays must originate in a vertically extended region . assuming the best - fit system parameters of @xcite
, we estimate that materials that are @xmath51 ( where @xmath52 is the binary separation ) above the orbital plane should remain uneclipsed
. the limit could be somewhat larger if the inclination is underestimated by @xcite .
is this a single , extended x - ray source , or can there be an eclipsed component and an uneclipsed component ? from the data in hand , we can not rule out the latter possibility . we could test this if we had a higher quality x - ray light curve of the eclipse .
a two - component model would predict a sharp ingress and egress , while a single extended source would result in a more gradual eclipse transitions . here
we proceed assuming a single extended source , since we do not have a physical model corresponding to the two - component model .    the partial eclipse of uv emission lines in dq  her  also demonstrates the presence of an extended emission region @xcite .
the last authors , in particular , have analyzed the time - resolved profile of the civ @xmath531550 line through the eclipse . at mid - eclipse
, this line is clearly redshifted , which they argue is a strong indication that the residual line flux originates in an accretion disk wind ( see also figure 7 . of @xcite ) , even though an accretion disk wind is usually seen only in non - magnetic cvs with high accretion rate ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .
these systems have an accretion disk that extends all the way down to the white dwarf surface and an optically thick boundary layer .
the presence of wind in dq  her , a system with no boundary layer and a luminous but truncated disk , suggests that the accretion geometry does not dictate whether a cv has a wind or not @xcite .
dq  her  appears to be sufficient luminous to drive a wind , as the fluxes of the heii recombination lines in dq  her  requires an ionizing luminosity of order @xmath54 ergss@xmath9 @xcite .
the presence of the accretion disk wind in dq  her  might make this an unusual ip , since we are not aware of any reports of accretion disk winds in other ips .
instead , it suggests a natural parallel with the dwarf nova oy  car in superoutburst and the nova like system ux  uma .
both are bright non - magnetic cv with accretion disk wind ; both are deeply eclipsing in the optical yet no x - ray eclipses were observed in oy  car in supreoutburst @xcite or in ux  uma @xcite .
this is interpreted to imply that the central x - ray source in these systems can not be seen directly , but instead is seen indirectly after scattering in an extended corona or wind .
the _ euve _
observation of oy  car in superoutburst @xcite confirms this basic picture , since the observed spectrum can be modeled as resonant scattering of continuum photons in an accretion disk wind . a wind , rather than a static corona , is strongly favored since
the euv emission lines are seen to have fwhm of @xmath372300 kms@xmath9 .
we believe the same resonant scattering model can be applied to the observed soft x - rays from dq  her , except that the nature of the unseen central source must be different ( see  4.3 ) .
a static corona can also be the scattering site for the x - ray photons observed in dq  her .
however , that would make it different from oy  car , where the euv line widths prove the wind to be responsible for scattering .
secondly , the uv line profile during the eclipse is indicative of a wind , while we do not know if a static corona exists in this system .
finally , the depth of the partial eclipse demands a large vertical extent ( @xmath51 , see above ) for the scattering region .
this is well away from the disk and probably is an unlikely location for a static corona .
we therefore interpret the observed soft x - rays as due to resonant scattering of an unseen central source .
furthermore , we prefer the accretion disk wind as the scattering site , pending final confirmation in the form of x - ray line widths . it is interesting to note that a partial x - ray eclipse is detected in dq  her , while none has been found in oy  car or ux  uma .
it is not clear , however , whether this indicates some difference in the wind geometry compared with between dq  her  and non - magnetic systems , or if this is simply due to the more extreme inclination angle in dq  her .
the observed x - ray luminosity of 35 @xmath33 ergss@xmath9 is likely to be a small fraction of the intrinsic luminosity of the central source , although this depends strongly on the unknown efficiency of scattering in the wind .
the flux of the he  ii  @xmath55 line has been used to estimate an ionizing luminosity of 12 @xmath56 ergss@xmath9 @xcite .
can this be in the form of a hard component ( kt@xmath3720 kev bremsstrahlung ) usually seen in ips ? to investigate this question , we have modeled the reflection of such a component off the surface of the roche - lobe filling secondary , applying the method of @xcite developed for hercules x-1 .
x - rays hitting the cold material on the surface of the secondary can be scattered or absorbed ; since softer photons are more likely to be absorbed , the scattered component is harder than the incident component .
we have evaluated the 58 kev flux expected from reflection from the secondary as a function of the orbital phase , taking into account the shadowing by the accretion disk and the roche - lobe filling shape of the secondary , assuming the system parameters of @xcite , as listed in  1 . for the computational details , see @xcite .
the reflection component should be most prominent at the highest energy band of _ chandra _ , 58 kev .
the viewing geometry for the reflection component is most favorable at orbital phase 0.5 ; it would result in a strong , sinusoidal orbital modulation .
however , no such component is detected in our _ chandra _  data in the 58 kev data .
this can be converted to the upper limit of the bolometric luminosity of the hard component as a function of the disk thickness ( figure 4 ) .
taking our upper limit in the phase bin around phase 0.5 , 1/16th cycle wide , to be 7.0@xmath39 ctss@xmath9 , we estimate an upper limit to the kt=20 kev bremsstrahlung luminosity of 10@xmath57 ergss@xmath9 for a disk @xmath58 ( height over radius ) of less than 0.23 , or half - opening angle @xmath59 ( @xmath60 for a kt=50 kev bremsstrahlung due to the different bolometric correction ) .
if the intrinsic hard component luminosity is 10@xmath61 ergss@xmath9 , the reflected luminosity can be reduced to an undetectable level if the disk half opening angle is @xmath62 for kt=20 kev ( @xmath63 for kt=50 kev ) , almost completely shadowing the secondary .    in comparison , the eclipsing and dipping low - mass x - ray binary exo0748@xmath49676 has an inclination of @xmath64 @xcite : the presence of x - ray eclipses require the opening angle of the disk to be less than 15@xmath65 toward the secondary in this system . although azimuthal structures at such heights are commonly inferred ( including one in u gem 25@xmath65 above the disk ; @xcite ) , we are not aware of claims for disks thicker than 15@xmath65 in the direction toward the secondary . we therefore conclude that the central hard x - ray component is less luminous than inferred from the he  ii  @xmath55 line , unless the disk in dq  her  has an unusually large thickness .
further studies of the disk thickness , however , are required to tighten the upper limit of the hard component luminosity .
in contrast , the lack of reflection component does not allow us to put a useful constraint on the central luminosity , if it has a soft spectrum .
accretion luminosity in dq  her  would be dominated by a soft , blackbody - like component , if the shock is buried within the white dwarf atmosphere .
in addition , the entire photosphere of the primary may still be hot from the thermonuclear runaway of 1934 .
the soft component in am her type magnetic cvs have a typical temperature of 2030 ev @xcite ; even using a kt=100 ev blackbody , the spectrum is too soft to result in appreciable reflection signature .
therefore , our results are consistent with the ionizing luminosity of 12 @xmath56 ergss@xmath9 @xcite if this is in the form of a soft component , regardless of the disk height .
we appear to have detected extended emission features , one about 8 arcsec s to sw of , and another about 9 ne of dq  her .
the latter location corresponds to a bright [ nii ] knot in the dq  her  shell , while the former has no obvious optical feature associated with it @xcite .
we consider it likely that these small excesses are real and represent x - ray knots in the dq  her  shell . a similar , but much brighter
, x - ray shell has been seen around gk  per ( nova persei 1901 ; @xcite ) .
this shell has a soft thermal spectrum , with a prominent neix line at 0.9 kev @xcite .
we do not have enough photons for a spectral analysis for the dq  her  shell , but it appears much softer than the gk  per shell .
this could result from a different speed class ( dq  her  was a slow nova , while gk  per was a fast nova ) , as well as from a different environment around dq  her  than around gk  per .
the luminosity in the dq  her  knot appears to be a few times 10@xmath66 ergss@xmath9 , subject to a large uncertainty in count rate to flux conversion , due to the unknown spectral shape .
given the probable discovery of x - rays from the shell , and the apparent lack of strong hard x - rays from the central source , it may be useful to revisit the models of uv and optical spectra of the shell .
for example , @xcite assumed a hard x - ray emitting magnetic cv with a luminosity in excess of 10@xmath61 ergss@xmath9 as the source of ionizing photons .
our work casts some doubt on such a picture .
@xcite , on the other hand , assumed a 10@xmath3 k blackbody source , which is consistent with our x - ray data of the central binary .
however , how do the shell x - rays fit in ?    @xcite interprets the x - rays from the gk  per shell as a miniature supernova remnant . in this model
, the nova ejecta are plowing into the surrounding interstellar medium and shock heated into x - ray emitting temperatures .
there certainly is ample kinetic energy in the nova ejecta to power shell x - ray emission , and the ejecta velocities are fast enough to result in x - ray emitting temperatures .
the photoionization model of uv and optical lines , on the other hand , suggest a cold shell .
we regard this not as an outright contradiction , but as an additional evidence for the co - existence of hot and cold matter in nova shells .
we have long known of spectra that show both hot and cold components in nova shells @xcite .
more recent imaging results @xcite and theoretical work @xcite show the importance of rayleigh - taylor instability .
nova shells are complex , multi - phased entities , including , as it now appears , x - ray emitting knots .
our _ chandra _  observation of the old nova dq  her  have revealed a partial x - ray eclipse .
we believe that the most likely explanation is scattering in the accretion disk wind , with a central x - ray source which is hidden from our view by the accretion disk at all orbital phases . in this model , dq  her  is similar to oy  car in superoutburst and to ux  uma . with a higher signal - to - noise observation , such as we can hope to achieve with _ xmm - newton _ , we should be able to measure the x - ray eclipse profile in detail , and check the reality of the phase offset between x - ray and optical eclipses .
we also detect an apparent weak extended feature , which we interpret as an x - ray emitting knot in the nova shell .
this would make dq  her  the second classical nova , after gk  per , with an x - ray emitting shell .

 nevertheless , soft x - rays were detected from dq  her  with _ rosat _  pspc . to probe the origin of these soft x - rays , 
 we have performed _ chandra _  acis observations . 
 we confirm that dq  her  is an x - ray source . 
 the bulk of the x - rays are from a point - like source and exhibit a shallow partial eclipse . 
 we interpret this as due to scattering of the unseen central x - ray source , probably in an accretion disk wind . at the same time , we observe what appear to be weak extended x - ray features around dq  her , which we interpret as an x - ray emitting knot in the nova shell . "
"nearby galaxies can provide many important clues for us to understand the star formation history , evolution process and relation between them and the milky way ( mw ) . in the past decade , the accurate abundance of dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( dsphs ) has allowed a detailed study of their star formation and chemical evolution histories @xcite . some important chemical signatures , such as the lower [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios , have been studied .
@xcite found that the galactic winds can remove a large fraction of gas and the elements produced by massive stars , which would reduce the enrichment of the interstellar medium ( ism ) . @xcite and @xcite suggested that the low abundance ratios could be due to a low star formation rate . based on the study of chemical evolution of dsphs
, @xcite found that the low [ @xmath0/fe ] could be explained quantitatively by a sudden decrease of star formation . because of
relatively shallow potential wells for dwarf galaxies , the strong galactic winds can remove a large fraction of the gas and , consequently , the star formation rate drops to a very low value . in this case , the enrichment of @xmath0 elements by massive stars is almost halted and sne ia are left to contribute their production , such as iron group elements , due to longer lifetime . as a result , when the galactic winds occur , the [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios decrease @xcite .    using the high resolution spectroscopy
, @xcite analyzed the elemental abundances of the red giant branch stars in the central region of the fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy ( fornax dsph ) .
this analysis shows the lower ratios of [ @xmath0/fe ] , [ ni / fe ] and [ cr / fe ] compared with those in the mw stars . in contrast , the abundance of some neutron - capture elements , such as ba and la , are enhanced .
they found that their sample stars have unusually abundance patterns and that the fornax dsph is a chemically complex system .
the fornax dsph is one of the dwarf spheroidal companions to the milky way .
it is a luminous dwarf galaxy with a luminosity of @xmath2= @xmath3 @xcite and the second most massive dwarf galaxy satellites of our galaxy with a total ( dynamical ) mass in the range @xmath4 @xcite .
moreover , it shows a wider range of metallicity and multiple populations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .
the observed abundances of individual stars could provide an excellent opportunity to study the star formation history and complicated chemical evolution history of the fornax dsph .
recently , @xcite studied abundance trends in fornax dsph and concluded that a different form of the initial mass function ( imf ) is needed .
he found that the lack of very massive stars ( m@xmath5 ) may explain the low [ @xmath0/fe ] observed in the fornax dsph . on the other hand , based on the analysis of the colour - magnitude diagrams and the spectroscopic metallicity distributions of individual red giant branch stars , @xcite studied the star formation history of the fornax dsph .
they found that although the fornax dsph is dominated by intermediate age ( 1 - 10 gyr ) stellar populations , the star formation is clearly present at all ages , from 14 gyr to 0.25 gyr .
this implies that the galactic wind effect is not intense enough to halt the star formation in the fornax dsph .
elements heavier than iron are mainly synthesized by neutron - capture process in two ways : one is the slow neutron - capture process ( the s - process ) and the other is the rapid neutron - capture process ( the r - process ) @xcite . the s - process is divided into the weak s - component and the main s - component .
the weak s - process occurs in the massive stars ( @xmath6 ) undergoing core he burring and shell c burring @xcite .
otherwise , the main s - process elements are produced in the low- to intermediate - mass stars ( @xmath71.5@xmath88@xmath9 ) during the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) phase @xcite .
type ii supernovae ( sne ii ) are usually considered to be the candidates in which the r - process nucleosynthesis occurs @xcite .
because of the large eu overabundance ( [ eu / fe]@xmath101.6 ) , two metal - poor stars cs 22892 - 052 and cs 31082 - 001 arose extensive attention .
these two stars are called as
 main r - process stars ' , because their abundance patterns of the heavier neutron - capture elements match the solar - system r - process pattern well ( e.g. , @xcite ) . however , their lighter neutron - capture elements are too deficient to fit the solar - system s r - process pattern .
this implies that another process , which is referred to the  lighter element primary process ' @xcite or  weak r - process ' @xcite , is needed .
the abundance patterns of weak r - process stars , hd 122563 and hd 88609 , show an excess of lighter neutron - capture elements and a deficiency of heavier neutron - capture elements @xcite .
observational abundances of metal - poor stars in the mw show that the heavier neutron - capture elements and light elements are not produced in the same sites @xcite .
this implies that the main r - process should occur in o - ne - mg core - collapse sne ii with progenitors of 8 - 10@xmath11 @xcite .
otherwise , the weak r - process elements are coupled with the light elements and iron group elements @xcite . the primary light elements and iron group elements ( i.e.
, the yields independent of initial metallicity approximately ) are produced in massive stars with @xmath12 @xcite .
@xcite analyzed the abundance of metal - poor stars and found that the weak r - process abundance pattern is uniform and unique .
based on the observed abundances of weak r - process stars and the main r - process stars , @xcite derived the abundances of weak r - process and main r - process using an iterative method and extended  the weak r - process component ' to primary light elements and primary iron group elements .
they found that the abundances in all metal - poor stars contain the contributions from the two r - processes .    because stars of different mass contribute different elements to the dsph on different timescales , the abundances of individual stars contain the contributions from various astrophysical processes and are the integrated results over the lifetime of the system since the stars were born . in order to reveal the complicated star formation history and evolution process of fornax dsph ,
it is important to analyze the elemental abundances in detail , including @xmath0 elements , iron group elements and neutron - capture elements .
these reasons inspired us to study the abundance of the dsph stars . in this case , the quantitative decomposing stellar elemental abundances of the contributions from various astrophysical processes are significant . in this paper , we study the astrophysical origins that reproduc the abundance pattern of 56 stars in the fornax dsph , in which the @xmath0 elements , iron group elements , lighter neutron - capture elements and heavier neutron - capture elements have been observed , and we analyze the relative contributions from the individual processes .
the five - component abundance approach is described in section 2 . in section 3 , the analysis of calculated results are presented .
section 4 is our conclusions .
several previous studies on the abundances of neutron - capture elements have indicated that for most stars , the observed abundances of the heavy elements can not be matched by only one neutron - capture process @xcite .
one of our major goals is to explore the astrophysical origin of elements , including light elements , iron group elements and neutron - capture elements , in the stars of the fornax dsph by comparing the observed abundances with the predicted contributions of various astrophysical processes .
the ith element abundance can be calculated as    @xmath13)=(c_{r , m}n_{i , r , m}+c_{pri}n_{i , pri}+c_{s , m}n_{i , s , m}+c_{sec}n_{i , sec}+c_{ia}n_{i , ia})\times10^{[fe / h]}\ ] ]    where @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the abundances of the ith element produced by the main r - process , the primary process in massive stars , the main s - process , the secondary process in massive stars , and sne ia , respectively , which have been normalized to abundances of the solar system ; the component coefficients @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 represent the relative contributions from the main r - process , the primary process , the main s - process , the secondary process and sne ia , respectively . using the five component coefficients , we can determine the relative contributions of each process to the elemental abundances and then compare them with the corresponding component coefficients of the solar system ( or [ fe / h]=0 ) in which @xmath19=@xmath20=@xmath21=@xmath22=@xmath23=1 . however , these component coefficients are not usually expected to be equal to each other . for example
, the abundances of neutron - capture elements in the interstellar gas that formed very metal - deficient stars is expected to come from mostly r - process events @xcite .
this method was used by @xcite to study the abundances of ba stars .
the abundances of @xmath18 are taken from @xcite , in which the abundances of fe , cu and zn are adopted from @xcite .
observational abundances of metal - poor stars in the mw show that the weak r - process elements are coupled with the primary light elements and iron group elements @xcite .
massive stars ( m@xmath24 ) are the astrophysical origins of the primary elements , including the primary light elements , iron group elements and weak r - process elements , and provide significant contributions to the solar abundances for these elements .
note that the mass range of progenitors in which the light elements and iron group elements were produced should be different from the progenitor mass range of sne ii in which the weak r - process elements were produced .
the sites of weak r - process should be the fe - core - collapse sne ii with progenitors of mainly about 11 - 25@xmath11 @xcite from which the primary light elements and iron group elements are also ejected .
however , more massive stars ( m@xmath5 ) can also produce the primary light elements and iron group elements @xcite .
in this case , the contributions from the more massive stars should have existed in the observational abundances of the metal - poor stars and are difficult to separated out . because the contributions from the more massive stars , which have shorter lifetime , are always present at various times , the light elements and iron group elements in  the weak r - process component ' derived from the weak r - process stars , hd 122563 and hd 88609 , should contain the contributions from the more massive stars . in this work , the weak r - process component derived by @xcite
is called the  primary component ' , since the associated light elements , iron group elements and the weak r - process elements are produced in massive stars as primary yields .
note that the best - fitted results of the metal - poor stars with metallicity range -3.0@xmath25[fe / h]@xmath25 - 2.0 for the light elements and iron group elements by @xcite imply that a more complete analysis using the abundances of more metal - poor stars would likely offer only minor corrections to the abundances pattern of the primary component .
the abundances of main r - process @xmath14 are adopted from @xcite .    due to the secondary - like nature of major neutron source @xmath26 ,
the contributions from weak s - process are negligible for metal - poor stars @xcite .
the abundances of weak s - process are taken from @xcite at [ fe / h]=0
. the ratios of [ @xmath0/fe ] observed for the mw stars show a plateau at [ fe / h]@xmath1 - 1 , which means that the @xmath0 elements are produced mainly by the primary - like mechanisms .
based on nucleosynthesis calculations , @xcite found that the effect of metallicity on the production of @xmath0 elements in massive stars is mild .
however , the observed increase in some odd - z elements and iron group elements toward high [ fe / h ] is the effect of metallicity on nucleosynthesis @xcite .
nucleosynthesis calculations for massive stars show that the yields of some odd - z elements ( e.g. , na and al ) and iron group elements ( e.g. , mn ) increased with increasing metallicity @xcite .
the astrophysical sites of , and dominant contributing processes to , some iron group elements still have not been reliably established .
@xcite found that the abundance of iron group element cu in the mw contains the contributions from the primary process and secondary process ( i.e. , the yields which increase with increasing initial metallicity ) in massive stars . according to estimate of @xcite , the contributed fraction from the secondary process in massive stars for cu
is reached about 25% for the solar system . @xcite
have found that for disk stars , although the iron group elements are mostly synthesized by sne ia , the secondary - like contributions from the massive stars are non - negligible .
@xcite found that , for light elements and iron group elements , the abundances in the solar system are higher than the sum of contributions from primary component and sne ia , because the contributions from secondary - like yields produced in the massive stars are not included . in this work ,
we obtain the secondary - like abundances for the light elements and iron group elements by subtracting the sum of the contributions of primary - like yields ( adopted from @xcite ) , sne ia ( adopted from @xcite ) and main s - process component ( adopted from @xcite ) from the solar system abundances ( adopted from @xcite ) .
this procedure ensures that the sum of the abundances of four components is not overproduced with respect to solar . because the weak s - process elements are also produced in massive stars and have a secondary nature , the secondary - like abundances of light elements and iron group elements should be tightly related to the weak s - process abundances .
the secondary light elements , iron group elements and the weak s - process elements are produced in the massive stars ( m@xmath24 ) @xcite .
however , the mass range of the stars in which the light elements and iron group elements were produced should be different from those of the stars in which the weak s - process elements were produced .
the sites of the weak s - process ( and the part of secondary - like yields for the light elements and iron group elements ) are mainly the massive stars with @xmath27 @xcite .
however , the more massive stars ( m@xmath28 ) can also produce the secondary light elements and iron group elements .
the contributions from the more massive stars are difficult to distinguish in the observed abundances of the sample stars , because the timescale is long enough to permit all massive stars to eject their productions for higher metallicities ( [ fe / h]@xmath29 - 2.0 ) .
recently , @xcite reported that the weak s - process also occurs in star with 70@xmath11 .
this would mean that the mass range of stars in which the weak s - process occurs may be similar to those of stars in which the secondary light elements and iron group elements were produced .
based on the discussions above , we combined the secondary - like abundances for the light elements and iron - group elements with weak s - process abundances as  the secondary component ' . the secondary component
@xmath17 contains the abundances of the light elements , iron group elements and the weak s - process elements .
based on the observations , @xcite found that compare to the mw , the ratios of [ ba / fe ] and [ y / fe ] in the dsph show larger dispersions and [ ba / y ] are exceedingly high .
this means that the ism in the dsph is chemical inhomogeneous and the abundance pattern of s - process elements of a newly - formed star was polluted by the winds of low - mass agb stars with low - metallicity in the vicinity . in this case
, the s - process nucleosynthesis favors heavier nuclei over lighter ones , since more neutrons can be captured by an iron seed nucleus @xcite . obviously , there are some differences in the chemical evolution characteristics between the dsph and the mw , which lead to the different s - process abundance patterns between the dsph and the milky way .
so , the s - process abundance patterns of the mw are not adequate to used in the dsph stars . considering the wide range of metallicity of the sample stars ( -1.4@xmath1[fe / h]@xmath1 - 0.5 ) in dsph , the abundance pattern of @xmath16 in equation ( 1 ) is calculated as the mixing of the main s - process abundance produced by low - mass agb stars with [ fe / h]=-1.0 and [ fe / h]=-0.6 , which are given by @xcite .
we calculate the main s - process abundance using the equation : @xmath30=-1)+c_{2}n_{i , s , m}([fe / h]=-0.6)\ ] ] in which @xmath16 , @xmath31([fe / h]=-1 ) and @xmath31 ( [ fe / h]=-0.6 ) have been normalized to the main s - process component of ba in solar system @xcite . in this case , @xmath21=@xmath32+@xmath33 . by comparison , for the stars in the mw ,
the adopted metallicity - dependent abundance pattern @xmath16 in equation ( 1 ) is taken from the main s - process abundance given by @xcite ( see their fig .
12 ) and @xcite ( see their fig . 3-fig .
6 ) , which included the contributions of low- to intermediate - mass agb stars ( @xmath34 ) and also has been normalized to the main s - process abundance of ba in solar system .    in equation ( 1 )
, we have defined five component coefficients .
we can obtain them by looking for the minimum @xmath35 .
the reduced @xmath35 is defined as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the abundance calculated from equation ( 1 ) , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the observed abundance and error of the ith element , respectively , @xmath40 is the number of elements applied in the fit and @xmath41 is the number of free parameters . here ,
@xmath41=5 , because equation ( 1 ) contains five component coefficients .
using component coefficients , we can determine the relative contributions of each individual process to the stellar abundances .
moreover , we can compare the derived component coefficients with the corresponding coefficients of the solar system in which all of them are equal to 1 .
for the sample stars , the five component coefficients are not equal to each other , because their elemental abundances are not in solar proportions .
in this work we analyze the observational constraints provided by the elemental abundances of the stars in the fornax dsph to investigate the relative contributions from the individual process . using the observed data of fornax dsph stars @xcite
, the fitted parameters can be obtained .
the derived component coefficients and @xmath35 are listed in table 1 .
a comparison between the abundance - decomposed results of fornax dsph stars and the mw stars with a similar metallicity range is necessary to ascertain whether the elements in the two galaxies have a similar origin or a different chemical evolution history . using the observed data of the mw stars @xcite ,
the derived component coefficients and @xmath35 are listed in table 2 .
the [ fe / h ] distributions of the dsph stars and the mw sample stars are compared in figure 1 .
one can see that the dsph stars have a similar distribution of [ fe / h ] to that of the milky way .    as two examples ,
the calculated best - fitting results for the dsph star bl185 and the mw star hip 72803 are shown in fig .
the solid lines and filled circles represent the calculated results and the observed abundances , respectively .
the top panels of figs .
3(a ) and 3(b ) show the individual relative offsets ( @xmath42=@xmath43 ) for the dsph stars and mw stars , respectively .
the bottom panels of figs .
3(a ) and 3(b ) show the root - mean - square offset in @xmath44 .
typical observational uncertainties in @xmath44 are @xmath45 dex ( dash lines ) .
it could be found from fig .
3 that the individual relative offsets are mostly smaller than 0.30 dex and the root - mean - square offset is consistent with zero .
the calculated results shown in figs .
2 and 3 confirm the validity of the abundance approach adopted in this work .    in the study of the abundances of the dsph stars ,
the component coefficient as the function of metallicity is very important , since it shows the chemical evolution features of the dsph . if @xmath46 ( or @xmath47 , k = r , m ; pri ; s , m ; sec and ia ) , the contribution from the process corresponding to the elemental abundances is larger ( or less ) than that in the solar system , after excluding the effect of metallicity .
these component coefficients are not usually expected to be equal to each other , because the relative contributions of these components are not always in proportion to those of the solar - system .
the left panel and right panel in fig .
4 show the component coefficients @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 as a function of [ fe / h ] for the dsph stars and the mw stars , respectively . in this work ,
the adopted primary component and secondary component contain the abundances of light elements , iron group elements and neutron - capture elements . for neutron - capture elements ,
@xmath20 and @xmath22 represent the component coefficients of weak r- and weak s - process , respectively . for light elements and iron group elements ,
@xmath20 and @xmath22 represent the contributions from primary - like and secondary - like yields in massive stars , respectively .    for detailed comparisons , figs .
5 ( a)-5 ( e ) show the distributions of five component coefficients obtained for the dsph stars ( solid lines ) and the mw stars ( dash lines ) .
there is a tendency for the component coefficients @xmath19 , @xmath21 and @xmath23 of the dsph stars to be larger than those of the mw sample stars .
this means that the contributions from main r - process , main s - process and sne ia to the abundances of the dsph stars are larger than those of the mw stars
. however , a trend exists wherein the component coefficients @xmath20 and @xmath22 of the dsph stars are smaller than those of the mw stars .
this means that the contributions from the primary process ( or weak r - process ) and the secondary process ( or weak s - process ) to the dsph stars are smaller than those to the mw stars .
the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) is an important function of a galaxy , which can be applied extensively to various aspects of astrophysics .
the imf of a dwarf galaxy may depend on its dynamics and kinematics characteristics @xcite and directly effect the chemical abundances of the dwarf galaxy stars . because the @xmath0 elements , iron group elements , lighter neutron - capture elements and heavier neutron - capture elements have different astrophysical origins
, one could investigate the imf using the contributions of various processes to the abundances of the dsph stars . recall that the main r - process should occur in o - ne - mg core - collapse sne ii with progenitors of 8 - 10@xmath11 and
the primary elements ( including primary light elements , iron group elements and weak r - elements ) are produced in the massive stars with @xmath12 . on the other hand ,
the secondary elements ( including secondary light elements , iron group elements and weak s - elements ) are produced in the massive stars ( m@xmath24 ) and the main s - process elements are mainly produced in the low - mass agb stars ( @xmath101.5 - 3@xmath9 ) . in fig .
6 , we show the ratios of the average component coefficient between the dsph stars and the mw stars as function of progenitor mass .
the ratios monotonously decrease with the increasing progenitor mass .
this means that , compare to the mw , the bottom - heavy imf for the fonax dsph is strongly suggested .    because stars of various mass contribute different elements to the dsph on different timescales , the observed abundances of the sample stars are the integrated results over the lifetime of the system since the stars were born . in order to make a progress in understanding the chemical evolution of fornax dsph in greater detail
, we derive the component ratios of the individual process ( i.e. , [ element / h]@xmath48 ( k = r , m ; pri ; s , m ; sec ; sne ia ) ) with various metallicities and compare them with those of the mw stars . in figs . 7 - 11
, we show the component ratios of fe , @xmath0 element mg , iron group element ni , lighter neutron - capture element y and heavier neutron - capture element ba .
for ease of comparison with the solar system , we add some lines in these figures .
the dash dotted lines , solid lines , short dotted lines , dash lines , and dotted lines represent the solar component ratios of the main r - process , primary process , main s - process , secondary process and sne ia , respectively . from fig
. 7 ( b ) , we can see that for the mw stars , the contributions from the primary - like yields to [ fe / h ] ratios are larger than those from sne ia and the secondary - like yields
. however , fig . 7
( a ) shows that the fe abundances for the dsph stars predominantly come from sne ia and the ratios of sne ia have reached the solar ratio .
these results are consistent with the bottom - heavy imf for the dsph . in this case , the contributions from the primary - like yields and secondary - like yields produced in the massive stars to the dsph are smaller than corresponding contributions to the milky way .    from fig .
8 ( b ) we can see that , for the mw stars , the mg abundances predominantly come from the primary process and the ratios are larger than the solar ratio . in fig . 8 ( a ) , we find that the mg abundances in the dsph stars also mainly come from the primary process in the massive stars . however , the ratios of the primary process of the dsph stars are close to that of the solar system and lower than those of the mw stars . from fig . 8 ( a )
we can see that the ratios of [ mg / h]@xmath49 , which represent the contributions from massive stars to the primary yields , increase monotonously with increasing [ fe / h ] .
this means that the massive stars have continued chemical enrichment during the dsph evolution , even though they do not dominate the fe enrichment . in other words , for the fornax dsph , the stars formed at all ages and the contributions from the massive stars to @xmath0 elements did not stop , at least for [ fe / h ] reaching to -0.5 . the continual contributions from the massive stars to the primary yields of iron group elements for the metallicity range from [ fe / h]=-1.0 to [ fe / h]=-0.5 can also be found from figure 7 and figure 9 for iron group elements fe and ni .
the correlation between [ mg / h]@xmath49 and [ fe / h ] obtained from this work is a significant evidence that the effect of the galactic wind is not strong enough to halt the star formation in the fornax dsph . because of the bottom - heavy imf for the dsph , the contributions from the primary - like yields produced in the massive stars to the dsph are smaller than corresponding contributions to the milky way .
@xcite have found that the observed [ mg / fe ] of the dsph stars are lower than those of the mw stars and close to the solar ratio ( see their fig .
10 ) . after considering the bottom - heavy imf for the dsph , the abundance ratios of @xmath0 elements ( e.g. , mg , si , ca and ti ) observed in the dsph stars can be explained .    in fig .
9 ( b ) , for the mw stars , the calculated results imply that the ni abundances mainly come from the contributions of the primary process and secondary process . the component ratios of the primary process are larger than that of the solar primary ratio , and the component ratios of the secondary process have reached the solar secondary ratio at [ fe / h]@xmath50 .
although the component ratios of sne ia are smaller than the solar ratio , the component ratios of the primary- and the secondary - like yields produced in massive stars are larger than the corresponding solar ratios .
these are the reasons for the observed [ ni / fe]@xmath70 ( see fig .
12 in @xcite ) in the mw stars .
in contrast to the milky way , from fig . 9 ( a ) we can see that for the dsph stars , the component ratios of sne ia for ni are larger than those of the primary process and the secondary process .
the ratios of the sne ia are close to the solar ratio of the sne ia , and the ratios of the secondary process are lower than the solar secondary ratio by about 0.5 dex . @xcite
have found that the observed [ ni / fe ] of the dsph stars are lower than those of the mw stars and the solar system ( see their fig .
these results are consistent with a bottom - heavy imf for the dsph . in this case , although the component ratios of sne ia have reached the solar ratio , the component ratios of the primary process and the secondary process for the dsph are smaller than the corresponding ratios of the milky way .
these are the reasons of observed [ ni / fe]@xmath250 for the fornax dsph stars . the abundance ratios of another iron group element cr observed in the dsph stars can also be explained after considering the bottom - heavy imf .    from fig .
10(b ) , we can see that for the mw stars , the y abundances mainly come from the weak r - process and main s - process .
the component ratios of the weak r - process are larger than the solar ratio of weak r - process and the component ratios of the main s - process are smaller than the solar ratio of main s - process . on the other hand , from fig .
10 ( a ) we can see that , for most dsph stars , contributions from the main s - process exceed main r - process and weak r - process contributions , and the weak s - process contributions are negligible at all metallicities .
the ratios of the main s - process have reached the solar ratio at [ fe / h]@xmath51 .
because of the bottom - heavy imf , the contributions from main s - process in the agb stars to the dsph are larger than the corresponding contributions to the mw . although the average value of [ y / fe ] for dsph stars is close to that of the mw , the proportions contributed from main s - process , main r - process and weak r - process are obviously different .    from fig .
11(b ) we can see that for the mw stars , the ba abundances mainly come from the main r - process and main s - process .
the component ratios of the main r - process are larger than the solar ratio of main r - process and the ratios of the main s - process are slightly lower than the solar ratio of the main s - process . from fig .
11(a ) we can see that , for most dsph stars , contributions from the main s - process exceed contributions from main r - process for [ fe / h]@xmath52 - 1.0 and begin to drive [ ba / h ] upward to [ ba / h]=0 . in this case , the ratios of the main s - process for fornax stars are larger than those of the solar system and the mw stars . @xcite
have found that the observed [ ba / fe ] of most dsph stars are higher than those of the mw stars and the solar system ( see their fig .
it is natural result that the contributions of main s - process produced in agb stars to the dsph are larger than corresponding contributions to the milky way due to the bottom - heavy imf of the dsph .
similar to ba , the la abundance ratios of the dsph stars can be explained .
@xcite have found that [ eu / fe ] of dsph stars are at the same levels observed in the mw stars for the same [ fe / h ] .
our calculated results about main r - process component coefficients are consistent with their findings .
the apparent rise of [ la / fe ] or [ ba / fe ] observed in fornax dsph or sagittarius dsph is due to pollution by agb stellar wind .
the calculated results presented by @xcite show that [ la / fe ] ( or [ ba / fe ] ) decrease slightly at high metallicities , which is due to the effects of galactic winds on the star formation rate .
this means that there is a discrepancy between predictions of the chemical evolution model and observations .
furthermore , @xcite have found that an increase in the yields of la in agb stars by a factor that is smaller than four is not enough to match the observed ratios .
however , they reported that if the s - process yields of the agb stars were increased considerably , the yields could not be used in the mw and the solar system correctly .
obviously , there is other reason to explain the rise of [ ba / fe ] or [ la / fe ] observed in the dsphs .
historically , variations in the imf have been proposed to reduce the chemical enrichment from massive stars @xcite .
the truncated imf has been used as a possible cause of lowering [ @xmath0/fe ] in dwarfs @xcite . because the s - process yields should mainly be dependent on the initial mass and metallicity of the low mass agb stars , the average yields of the agb stars with the same initial mass and metallicity as the dsph should be similar to those of the mw . in this case , the rise of [ ba / fe ] or [ la / fe ] observed in the dsphs should be attributed to contributions from the larger number of agb stars .
so , the abundances of s - process elements , ba and la , in the dsph can be used to constrain the number of agb stars that have polluted the gas in which the star formed and , thus constrain the imf .
it is interesting to note that , based on our calculation , the ratio of the average main s - process coefficient between the fornax dsph and the mw is about 5.5 , which is close to the increased factor of the agb yields reported by @xcite .
our calculated results mean that the reason for the rise of [ ba / fe ] or [ la / fe ] observed in the dsphs is the bottom - heavy imf , which favors a larger number of low - mass agb stars .
in dsphs , nearly all chemical evolution and nucleosynthetic information is in the elemental abundances of stars with various metallicities . in this work , we investigate the astrophysical origins of the observed abundances of fornax dsph stars and derive the relative contributions from the individual astrophysical process .
our results can be summarized as follows :    \1 . adopting the five - component approach ,
the abundances of most sample stars , including @xmath0 elements , iron group elements , lighter and heavier neutron - capture elements , can be fitted .
the component coefficients of the main r - process , main s - process and secondary process of most dsph stars are different from those of the solar system
. however , the component coefficients of primary process and sne ia are close to those of the solar system .
the component coefficients of the main s - process , secondary process , primary process and sne ia of the dsph stars are obviously different from those of mw stars with similar range of metallicity .
the component coefficients of main r - process , main s - process and sne ia of most dsph stars are larger than those of the mw stars .
this means that the contributions from main r - process , main s - process and sne ia to the dsph stars are larger than those to the mw stars
. however , there are the trends for the dsph stars with smaller @xmath53 , and @xmath54 .
this implies that for the dsph stars , the contributions from primary process and secondary process are smaller than the corresponding contribution for the mw stars .
the detailed abundance trends of five components for fornax dsph could provide the information on the chemical enrichment history . we find that the contribution from massive stars as the primary yields of @xmath0 elements and iron group elements increases monotonously with increasing [ fe / h ] .
this means that the star formed , including massive stars , at all ages and the contributions from the massive stars to @xmath0 elements did not halted , at least until [ fe / h ] reached -0.5 .
these correlations provide the significant evidence that the effect of the galactic wind is not strong enough to halt the star formation in fornax for [ fe / h]@xmath1 - 0.5 .
the ratios of average component coefficient between the dsph stars and the mw stars monotonously decrease with the increasing progenitor mass .
the correlation is significant evidence of the bottom - heavy imf for the fonax dsph , compared to the milky way .    \5 .
although fornax dsph stars have a range of metallicity similar to the mw sample stars , the contribution proportions for fe from various astrophysical processes of fornax dsph stars are different with those of the mw stars .
for the mw stars the contributions of the primary - like yields to fe are larger than those of sne ia and the secondary - like yields .
however , the fe abundances in the dsph stars predominantly come from sne ia .
this means that the contributions from the massive stars to the dsph are smaller than corresponding contributions to the mw , which is consistent with the bottom - heavy imf for the dsph .
although mg abundances predominantly come from the contributions of the primary process for both the mw stars and the fornax dsph stars , the ratios of the primary process of the dsph stars are close to that of the solar system and lower than those of the mw stars .
this suggests that the contributions of the primary - like yields produced in the massive stars to the dsph are smaller than the corresponding contributions to the mw . after considering the bottom - heavy imf for the dsph , the lower [ @xmath0/fe ] observed in the dsph stars
can be explained .
\7 . for the mw stars ,
the abundances of the iron group element ni mainly come from the primary process and secondary process .
however , for the dsph stars , the component ratios of sne ia for ni are larger than those of the primary process and the secondary process .
although the component ratios of sne ia has reached the solar system ratio , the component ratios of the primary process and the secondary process for the dsph are smaller than corresponding ratios of the mw .
these are the reasons for observed [ ni / fe]@xmath250 for fornax dsph stars and are consistent with the bottom - heavy imf .
\8 . for the mw stars ,
the abundances of lighter neutron - capture element y mainly come from the weak r - process and main s - process . on the other hand , for most dsph stars
, the contributions from the main s - process exceed the contributions from main r - process and weak r - process . the contributions from weak s - process can be negligible at all metallicities .
although the average value of [ y / fe ] for dsph stars is close to that of the mw stars , the contributed proportions of the main s - process , main r - process and weak r - process are obviously different with those of the mw stars .    \9 . because there are some differences in the s - process abundance characteristics between the dsph and the mw , the s - process abundance patterns of the mw are not adequate to used in the dsph stars . by adopting the mixing of the main s - process abundance produced by low - mass agb stars with [ fe / h]=-1.0 and [ fe / h]=-0.6 presented by @xcite , the abundances of the s - process elements , ba and y , can be fitted .
the fitted results mean that the s - process elements in the dsph predominantly come from the low - mass agb stars , which is consistent with the suggestion of the bottom - heavy imf for the fornax dsph .
\10 . for the mw stars ,
the abundances of the heavier neutron - capture element ba mainly come from the contributions of the main r - process and main s - process . on the other hand , for the most dsph stars ,
contributions from the main s - process to ba exceed contributions from the main r - process for [ fe / h]@xmath52 - 1.0 and begin to drive [ ba / h ] upward to [ ba / h]=0 . the rise of [ ba / fe ] or [ la / fe ] observed in fornax dsph can be attributed to contributions from the larger number of agb stars .
it is a natural result that the contributions of main s - process produced in the low - mass agb stars to the dsph are larger than corresponding contributions to the milky way due to the bottom - heavy imf of the dsph .
our abundance approach is based on the abundance patterns of the main r - process , main s - process , sne ia , primary process and secondary process to decompose stellar elemental abundances , rather than the traditional galactic chemical evolution model which integrates stellar yields beginning from early galaxies .
this procedure allows us to use available elemental abundances to investigate their astrophysical origins and chemical evolution when each contribution is showed as a function of metallicity .
we hope that the results here will provide a useful guide for more complete chemical evolution models of fonax dsph .
obviously , a more precise knowledge about the elemental abundances in the dsph stars is needed .

 this implies that there is a key factor of galactic evolution that is different from that of the milky way ( mw ) . 
 the chemical abundances of the stars in the fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy ( fornax dsph ) provide excellent information for setting constraints on the models of the galactic chemical evolution . in this work , adopting the five - component approach , we fit the abundances of the fornax dsph stars , including @xmath0 elements , iron group elements and neutron - capture elements . for most sample stars , 
 the relative contributions from the various processes to the elemental abundances are not usually in the mw proportions . 
 we find that the contributions from massive stars to the primary @xmath0 elements and iron group elements increase monotonously with increasing [ fe / h ] . 
 this means that the effect of the galactic wind is not strong enough to halt star formation and the contributions from massive stars to @xmath0 elements did not halted for [ fe / h]@xmath1 - 0.5 . 
 the average contributed ratios of various processes between the dsph stars and the mw stars monotonously decrease with increasing progenitor mass . 
 this is important evidence of a bottom - heavy initial mass function ( imf ) for the fonax dsph , compared to the mw . considering a bottom - heavy imf for the dsph , the observed relations of [ @xmath0/fe ] versus [ fe / h ] , [ iron group / fe ] versus [ fe / h ] and [ neutron - capture / fe ] versus [ fe / h ] for the dsph stars can be explained .

"giant planets are found orbiting nearby stars with semimajor axes as small as 0.04  ( @xcite ) .
the difficulty of forming planets so close to a star has led to the suggestion that these planets formed at larger radii and migrated inwards , perhaps through gravitational interactions with the gaseous protoplanetary disk or planetesimal disk ( @xcite ) .
when massive planets migrate , they can capture smaller bodies in mean - motion resonances .
resonant capture in the solar system was invoked by goldreich ( 1965 ) to explain the frequent occurrence of commensurable periods among planetary satellites ; in this case the satellites are migrating outwards due to tidal friction ( see @xcite for a review ) .
similarly , the outward migration of neptune probably led to the capture of pluto and many kuiper - belt objects ( `` plutinos '' ) into the 2:3 resonance with neptune ( malhotra 1993 , 1995 ) .
all known examples of resonant capture in the solar system involve outward migration .
however , the compact orbits of exosolar planets are believed to result from inward migration .
the purpose of this paper is to explore some of the novel features of resonant capture during inward migration .
we shall use the delaunay elements , l=(m_a)^1/2 , g = l(1-e^2)^1/2 , h = gi , , g= , h= ; [ eq : delaunay ] here @xmath3 is the mass of the star in units where the gravitational constant is unity , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 are the semimajor axis , eccentricity , and inclination ; @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the mean anomaly , argument of periastron , and longitude of the ascending node ; @xmath10 is the specific angular momentum and @xmath11 is the @xmath12-component of the angular momentum . in these variables
the kepler hamiltonian is h_k(l)=-m_^22l^2 , [ eq : kepham ] and the mean motion @xmath13 .    for simplicity we shall consider only the case of a test particle that is captured by a massive body on a circular orbit with zero inclination .
we shall call this body `` jupiter '' ; its mass , semimajor axis , and mean motion are denoted by @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 .
a @xmath17 mean - motion resonance occurs when @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are integers .
we distinguish inner resonances , which lie inside jupiter ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) , from outer resonances ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) .
the hamiltonian of the test particle can be written in the form h_k(l)+_p , q , ma_pqm(l , g , h ) ; [ eq : hamres ] here @xmath27 is the azimuth of jupiter , and @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 are integers . the angles @xmath31 and @xmath32 can only appear in the combination @xmath33 because the hamiltonian is invariant to changes in the origin of the azimuth .
the restriction that the coefficient of @xmath34 must be an even integer @xmath35 arises because the planetary potential is symmetric about the equatorial plane , so that the hamiltonian must be invariant under the transformation @xmath36 , @xmath37 . for low - eccentricity , low - inclination orbits , @xmath38 for @xmath39 .
the terms with @xmath40 can also contain a contribution from an additional axisymmetric potential , due for example to a protoplanetary disk or the equatorial bulge of the central star .
terms with @xmath41 are sometimes called the secular hamiltonian since they do not depend on either the mean anomaly @xmath7 or the azimuth of jupiter @xmath32 and thus are time - independent for keplerian motion .
each @xmath17 mean - motion resonance is represented in the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamres ] ) by an infinite series in @xmath30 .
we can isolate the slowly varying resonant angle by a canonical transformation to new momenta and coordinates @xmath42 defined by the mixed - variable generating function s(,,g , h)=r_1 + r_2 g + r_3[p+ ( p+q)(g+h-_j ) ] .
[ eq : sssone ] we have l = s = r_1+pr_3,g = sg = r_2 + ( p+q)r_3,h = sh=(p+q)r_3 , [ eq : rdef ] r_1=sr_1= , r_2=sr_2=g , r_3=sr_3=p+ ( p+q)(g+h-_j ) . [
eq : ssstwo ] near the resonance , @xmath43 varies much more rapidly than @xmath44 or @xmath45 , so we can average the hamiltonian over the fast variable @xmath43 at fixed @xmath44 , @xmath45 .
the conjugate action @xmath46 is a constant of motion in the averaged hamiltonian and an adiabatic invariant of the original hamiltonian
. therefore c_pq(p+q)r_1=(p+q)l - ph=(m_a)^1/2[(p+q)-p(1-e^2)^1/2i ] [ eq : adinv ] is adiabatically invariant .
the averaged hamiltonian has two degrees of freedom .
the nature of the trajectories in the averaged hamiltonian depends on the relative strength of the secular and resonant hamiltonians .
if the secular hamiltonian is either large or small compared to the resonant hamiltonian , the timescales for libration or circulation of the associated coordinates @xmath44 and @xmath45 are well - separated , and the problem can be reduced to one degree of freedom by a second averaging . in the intermediate case ,
resonances with different @xmath30 can overlap , leading to chaotic motion .
all three regimes are present in various solar - system contexts .    despite these complexities ,
some of the principal features of resonant capture can be deduced directly from the adiabatic invariant @xmath47 ( eq . [ eq : adinv ] ) .
suppose that the test particle is initially on a circular , equatorial orbit at semimajor axis @xmath48
. then @xmath49 .
once the particle is captured into resonance , its semimajor axis will migrate along with jupiter s to preserve the mean - motion resonance , thereby pumping up the test particle s eccentricity and/or inclination .
the adiabatic invariance of @xmath47 then requires that ( 1-e^2)^1/2i=1+qp .
[ eq : kappadef ] the quantity on the left is initially unity ( since @xmath50 ) and can only decrease . for an outer resonance ( @xmath26 )
this requires that @xmath51 ; in other words capture into an outer resonance can only occur if the perturber migrates outward .
if the perturber migrates a long way outwards , then @xmath52 and @xmath53 .
note that @xmath54 since @xmath19 , @xmath55 ; thus captured orbits never achieve radial ( @xmath56 ) or polar ( @xmath57 ) orbits .
similarly , capture into an inner resonance ( @xmath23 ) can only occur if the perturber migrates inward . however , in this case the eccentricity and inclination evolution is more dramatic .
the quantity @xmath58 when @xmath59 ; in other words , by the time jupiter has migrated inward by a factor of @xmath60 after capture , the test particle has been driven onto either a radial or a polar orbit . if migration continues past this point and the test particle remains in resonance , it must be driven onto a retrograde orbit ( @xmath61 ) .
the minimum possible value of @xmath62 is @xmath63 ( for @xmath64 , @xmath65 ) .
this is attained when jupiter has migrated inward by a factor of @xmath66 since capture ; if migration continues past this point the test particle can not remain in resonance .
these simple considerations suggest that inward migration of a planet can excite small planets or planetesimals into high - eccentricity , high - inclination , or retrograde orbits . in the remainder of this paper
we shall investigate the evolution and fate of these objects numerically .
in our integrations we use units in which the gravitational constant , jupiter s initial semimajor axis @xmath67 and orbital period are all unity , so @xmath68 .
jupiter s mass is @xmath69 .
jupiter is assumed to follow a circular orbit that migrates inward according to the rule a_j(t)=a_jf+(1-a_jf)(-t/ ) , where @xmath70 and @xmath71 .
the test - particle integrations were carried out in regularized coordinates .
figure [ fig : one ] shows the evolution of a test particle initially on a zero - inclination , circular orbit with semimajor axis @xmath72 .
the test particle is captured into the 2:1 resonance ( @xmath73 ) with jupiter at @xmath74 .
thereafter its orbit shrinks and its eccentricity grows , as predicted by the adiabatic invariant @xmath62 ( eq . [ eq : kappadef ] ) . eventually at @xmath75 , when the semimajor axis has shrunk by a factor of @xmath76 since capture , the orbit is nearly radial ( @xmath77 ) . in typical planetary systems , a small body in this high - eccentricity phase
would be vaporized by or collide with the star , but we shall continue to follow the dynamical evolution assuming that the particle survives . at this point
the inclination flips rapidly from @xmath78 to @xmath79 ( recall that inclination is undefined for radial orbits ) .
once the inclination is @xmath79 the eccentricity shrinks as the orbit continues to shrink , again as predicted by adiabatic invariance .
finally , at @xmath80 , when the semimajor axis is a factor of @xmath81 smaller than at capture , the test particle is released from the resonance on a retrograde , equatorial , near - circular orbit .
figure [ fig : two ] shows the final states of an ensemble of test particles , on initially circular , zero - inclination orbits with initial semimajor axes @xmath48 between 0.26 and 0.6 .
the planet migrates from @xmath82 to @xmath70 , so the 2:1 resonance migrates from @xmath83 to @xmath84 . according to equation ( [ eq : kappadef ] ) , particles will be captured into resonance during the migration if @xmath85 , flipped onto retrograde orbits if @xmath86 , and released from resonance on nearly circular , retrograde orbits if @xmath87 . for particles with @xmath88 the eccentricity is given by a_i = a_rf^2 , [ eq : predict ] which is plotted as a dotted line .
all of these predictions agree very well with the results shown in the figure .
the evolution is more complicated when the test particles have non - zero eccentricities and inclinations .
figure [ fig : three ] shows the final states of test particles with the same range of initial semimajor axes as in figure [ fig : two ] , but with eccentricities and inclinations chosen from the schwarzschild or rayleigh distribution , n(e , i)dedi(-e^22e_0 ^ 2-i^22i_0 ^ 2)edeidi . [ eq : ray ] at the end of the integration , most of the particles
are found in one of three final states :    * the particles shown as filled circles are in retrograde ( @xmath89 ) orbits trapped in the 2:1 resonance , like those shown in figure [ fig : two ] .
if migration had continued , these would eventually be released from resonance on nearly circular orbits , after their semimajor axis had migrated by a factor 9 since capture ( this has already happened for two particles , marked by open circles ) .
these particles typically have small initial eccentricities and inclinations , @xmath90 , @xmath91 .
* the particles marked by crosses are on escape orbits , or chaotic orbits that are likely to escape in the future . in most cases these particles
are pumped onto high - eccentricity orbits , released from resonance , and then suffer a close encounter with jupiter , leading to a random walk in semimajor axis and eventual escape .
the evolution of the orbital elements in a typical case is shown in figure [ fig : four ] .
these particles typically have initial eccentricities @xmath92 .
note that the final eccentricity and inclination for the escaping orbits are given in the center - of - mass frame , while all other orbital elements in this and other figures are given in the star - centered frame . *
the particles marked by open triangles were trapped in the 2:1 resonance and later released on nearly polar orbits ( @xmath93 ) .
these particles have high eccentricities and arguments of perihelion @xmath8 that librate around @xmath94 .
this secular resonance protects high - eccentricity orbits from close encounters with jupiter , so the particle orbits are stable on the timescale of our integrations ( @xmath95 initial orbital periods of jupiter ) .
these orbits typically have initial inclination @xmath96 .
an example is shown in figure [ fig : five ] .
giant planets are found orbiting close to many nearby stars . because the conditions in the inner parts of protoplanetary disks are unfavorable to planet formation
, it is likely that these planets formed at much larger radii and migrated inward .
moreover , because the characteristic evolution times in a protoplanetary disk are longer at larger radius , it is likely that planetesimals and small planets had already formed interior to this giant planet before it began its inward journey . in these circumstances
resonant capture by the inward migrating planet is likely to occur at the 2:1 mean - motion resonance .
we have shown that small bodies that are captured from circular , equatorial orbits into the 2:1 resonance will be excited onto nearly radial orbits by the time their semimajor axis has shrunk by a factor of four , and released from the resonance on nearly circular retrograde orbits when the semimajor axis has shrunk by a factor of nine . in most of the known planetary systems ,
these small bodies would be consumed by the central star during this high - eccentricity phase .
thus , substantial migration of a giant planet is likely to pollute the outer parts of the star with most of the mass in the interior planetesimal disk : specifically , if the planet migrates from @xmath67 to @xmath97 , then the planetesimals with initial semimajor axes in the range @xmath98 will be excited to high - eccentricity orbits and are likely to be vaporized by or collide with the central star .
bodies that do not collide with the star will eventually be released from resonance as migration continues . some of these will be ejected , but some are protected from ejection by secular resonance and can survive on polar , high - eccentricity orbits .
others are released from resonance on circular and equatorial but retrograde orbits , and will survive if the migration stops before the giant planet reaches their semimajor axis . thus ,
if the captured planets survive the high - eccentricity phase , their post - migration configuration may not be planar ; if the orbits are coplanar , they may not all orbit in the same direction .
if multiple bodies formed from a single disk ( `` planets '' ) are not necessarily on coplanar orbits , they may be difficult to distinguish from bodies formed from fragmentation of a collapsing gas cloud ( `` stars '' ) .
radial - velocity observations can not directly measure the relative inclinations of planets in multi - planet systems ; this determination requires astrometric measurements such as those planned for the space interferometry mission ( sim ) .
this preliminary study has not addressed many important issues , including the effects of an eccentric planet orbit , the stability of these resonances to gravitational noise from other planets and massive planetesimals , or migration in systems containing two or more giant planets ." ," we investigate resonant capture of small bodies by planets that migrate inwards , using analytic arguments and three - body integrations . 
 if the orbits of the planet and the small body are initially circular and coplanar , the small body is captured when it crosses the 2:1 resonance with the planet . 
 as the orbit shrinks it becomes more eccentric , until by the time its semimajor axis has shrunk by a factor of four , its eccentricity reaches nearly unity ( @xmath0 ) . in typical planetary systems , 
 bodies in this high - eccentricity phase are likely to be consumed by the central star . 
 if they can avoid this fate , as migration continues the inclination flips from 0 to @xmath1 ; thereafter the eccentricity declines until the semimajor axis is a factor of nine smaller than at capture , at which point the small body is released from the 2:1 resonance on a nearly circular retrograde orbit . 
 small bodies captured into resonance from initially inclined or eccentric orbits can also be ejected from the system , or released from the resonance on highly eccentric polar orbits ( @xmath2 ) that are stabilized by a secular resonance . 
 we conclude that migration can drive much of the inner planetesimal disk into the star , and that post - migration multi - planet systems may not be coplanar

"one very fascinating result in condensed matter physics in recent decades is the understanding that , in spite of early predictions,@xcite the long - range topological order associated with broken continuous symmetries can survive in systems with random pinning.@xcite in bulk type - ii superconductors with weak point - like disorder the existence of a novel bragg glass phase has been predicted.@xcite this reaffirmed experimental facts known since the 1970s , that vortex lattices in weak - pinning , bulk , type - ii superconductors can produce pronounced bragg peaks in neutron diffraction.@xcite recent experiments@xcite have shown that a genuine order - disorder transition occurs in vortex matter .
this transition appears to be the underlying mechanism of the well - known anomaly of the peak effect@xcite in the critical current near .
however there are still many outstanding issues concerning the bragg glass phase boundary and the nature of the disordered vortex state above the peak effect .
previous studies in a niobium single crystal have revealed an intriguing picture of the peak effect in weakly - pinned conventional superconductors .
neutron scattering has shown that a vortex lattice order - disorder transition occurs in the peak effect region .
this transition shows hysteresis and is believed to be first order , separating a low temperature ordered phase from a high temperature disordered one.@xcite the hysteresis was not observed across the lower field part of the superconducting - to - normal phase boundary .
magnetic ac - susceptometry showed that at lower fields the peak effect disappears as well , indicating further connection between the peak effect and the order - disorder transition.@xcite in addition , the line of surface superconductivity , @xmath0 , terminates in the vicinity of the region where the peak effect disappears .
this picture is summarized in fig.[fig1 ] .
it was thus proposed that the peak effect is the manifestation of a first - order transition which terminates at a multicritical point ( mcp ) where the peak effect line meets a continuous , abrikosov transition ,
. the mcp would be bicritical if a third line of continuous transitions ends there .
the transition lines considered as a possible third candidate were a continuous vortex glass transition , @xmath1 , and the line of surface superconductivity .
alternatively , the mcp would be tricritical if the disordered phase is a pinned liquid with no high field transition into the normal state.@xcite subsequently , the disappearance of the peak effect at low fields has also been reported in other systems.@xcite    thermodynamic considerations@xcite suggest that the mcp is likely a bicritical point .
since bicriticality implies the existence of competing types of order in the vortex system the question of which of the two lines , @xmath1 or @xmath0 , is relevant to the bicritical point has major importance .
its answer will provide insight into the disordered vortex state above the peak effect and the disordering transition itself .
evidently , the possible relevance of surface superconductivity to the destruction of bulk bragg glass ordering , and hence the existence of the multicritical point , can not be dismissed _
a priori_. in fact it is well known that surface premelting plays an important role in solid - liquid transitions.@xcite    [ ht ]     this issue could be resolved by repeating the ac magnetic susceptibility measurements after having suppressed surface superconductivity with appropriate surface treatment .
efforts to nondestructively achieve this , e.g. by elecroplating the sample surface with a ferromagnetic layer , proved unfruitful , possibly due to high oxygen content of the surface . to address the problem , we performed measurements of magnetocaloric effects on the nb single crystal studied by ling _ _ et al.__@xcite and park _ _ et al.__@xcite    here we report a study of the peak effect using a magnetocaloric technique .
clear features associated with the peak effect , have been identified in the magnetocaloric data .
we find that the superconducting to normal transition shows inhomogeneity broadening at all fields .
the peak effect in the bulk critical current is found to disappear when it enters into the inhomogeneity broadened transition region .
it is concluded that the concurrent disappearance of surface superconductivity and the peak effect is likely due to interference of surface superconductivity with the ac - susceptibility measurements .
nevertheless , the location of the mcp , as determined from magnetocaloric measurements , is in close vicinity to the location previously reported.@xcite the transition across @xmath1 seems to be the same as that at @xmath2 , and surface superconductivity plays only a coincidental role in the critical point .
this result suggests that the disordered vortex state , which is represented by the shaded part in fig.[fig1 ] , is a distinct thermodynamic phase .
bicriticality implies that this phase has an order parameter competing with that of the bragg glass phase .
we also discuss an alternative scenario , in which no critical point exists at any finite field or temperature .
the paper is organized as follows : in sec.[sec2 ] we review the basic principle of magnetocaloric measurements , and give the experimental details of the sample and the technique used . in sec.[sec3 ] we present our main results , discuss the consequences of irreversible and nonequilibrium effects on magnetocaloric measurements , and proceed to interpretation of the data and estimates of sample properties .
finally we summarize our findings and conclusions , and propose experimental work necessary to address the issues raised .
in studies of vortex phases in bulk superconductors , various experimental techniques provide complementary pieces of information . combining these in a consistent picture is a non - trivial task .
magnetic ac - susceptibility measurements are sensitive to screening currents , and thus to the location of peak effect features , but are not suitable for the identification and study of the mean field transition itself.@xcite commercial magnetometers are not suited for study of large samples .
calorimetric@xcite and ultrasonic attenuation@xcite measurements determine the upper critical field where bulk condensation of cooper pairs occurs , but it remains unclear under what circumstances they also provide a peak effect signature .
moreover the combination of information obtained with different techniques has to rely on thermometer calibration issues .
furthermore , the dynamical measurements suffer from thermal gradients in the studied samples .
magnetocaloric measurements overcome these difficulties because they are sensitive to both the presence of bulk superconductivity and to dynamical , flux - flow related effects .
moreover they can be performed in quasi - adiabatic conditions , where virtually no thermal gradients are present in the sample .
finally , they can be easily performed using a common calorimeter .
the magnetocaloric effect is a special case of thermomagnetic effects in the mixed - state of superconductors which have long been known and investigated.@xcite these arise from the coexistence of the superconducting condensate which is not involved in entropy - exchange processes for the superconductor , and the quasiparticles , localized in the vortex cores , which are entropy carriers . due to the presence of localized quasiparticles in the vortex cores , vortex motion results in entropy transport , which causes measurable thermal effects .
specfically , during field increase , new vortices are created at the edge of the sample , quasiparticles inside the vortices absorb entropy from the atomic lattice and cause quasi - adiabatic cooling of the sample .
conversely , during field decrease , the exiting vortices release their entropy to the atomic lattice , causing quasi - adiabatic heating .    typically , in an experiment , the amount of entropy carried by the vortices entering or leaving the sample is not the exact thermodynamic equilibrium vortex entropy .
the reason is that the vortex assembly is not equilibrated due to pinning as well as metastability associated with the underlying first - order phase transition at the peak effect . in practice , the magnetocaloric cooling and heating due to vortex entry and exit
can be understood formally in terms of the actual entropy exchange between the vortex and atomic lattices .
a superconductor subject to a changing magnetic field and allowed to exchange heat with the environment , undergoes a temperature change.@xcite this process is described by the relation : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the net rate of heat absorption , positive for absorption of heat by the sample , @xmath5 is the molar number of the superconductor , @xmath6 its temperature , @xmath7 the molar magnetocaloric coefficient , and @xmath8 the specific heat of the superconductor .
the magnetocaloric term in the equation induces temperature changes .
these are smeared out by the last term , describing the effect of specific heat .
nevertheless , in practice this last term is constrained to be negligible when magnetocaloric effects are measured . in our measurements
, we use very low field ramp rates ( @xmath9 ) , which result in very low temperature change rates ( @xmath10 ) causing the last term to be negligible .
a schematic of our setup is represented in fig.[fig2]a . in this setup , absorption or release of heat from the sample results in minute , but measurable , variation of its temperature . in a typical measurement ,
the sample temperature is first fixed at a selected value , @xmath11 .
subsequently , the field is ramped at a steady rate , resulting in quasi - adiabatic absorption or release of heat from the sample .
the resulting sample temperature change is recorded .
if we neglect irreversible and non - equilibrium effects , the temperature change of the sample ( ) around its static value , @xmath11 , allows us to determine the molar magnetocaloric coefficient by use of : @xmath12 where the sample temperature @xmath13 , differential thermal conductance of the heat link @xmath14 , molar number for the sample @xmath5 , and field ramp rate @xmath9 are all independently measured .
the latter is positive for increasing fields , negative for decreasing fields .      in deriving the above equations we assumed that heat
is only exchanged between the superconductor and the environment and that the superconductor reaches its quasi - static state as the measurement is performed . in an actual experiment , non - equilibrium and irreversible effects need to be considered .
the heat generated by the dissipative processes between the vortex lattice and atomic lattice leads to a modification of the left hand side of equations [ eq1]&[eq2 ] .
non - equilibrium effects lead to a modification of the right hand side . while the effects of the bean - livingston surface barrier,@xcite flux flow heating,@xcite and the bean critical state@xcite can be complex and subtle , a detailed analysis can be performed and it will be discussed in sec.[sec3b1 ] .
we show that the magnetocaloric measurements allow us to shed light into the problem of the peak effect in nb that would not have been possible with any other single technique . in concluding this section
, we note that since eq.[eq2 ] is approximate , in what follows we refrain from using to symbolize the quantity related to the magnetocaloric temperature change , @xmath15 .
instead , we choose @xmath16 to symbolize the measured `` entropy '' derivative .
we used a nb single crystal sample with mass of @xmath17 which was previously studied using sans and ac - susceptometry.@xcite it has an imperfect cylindrical shape ( radius @xmath18 , length @xmath19 ) with the cylinder axis oriented parallel to the [ 111 ] crystallographic direction .
it has a of @xmath20 and upper critical field @xmath21 , as previously reported.@xcite we performed a zero field specific heat measurement , shown in fig.[fig2]b .
this was done with the heat - pulse ( relaxation ) technique . from this measurement
we obtain the ginzburg - landau parameter @xmath22 which is higher than the previous estimate@xcite .
in addition we find a superconducting transition width of @xmath23 .
the residual resistivity ratio from @xmath24 to @xmath25 of this sample is measured to be 12 , suggesting a significant amount of defects in this nb crystal .
this is consistent with the large @xmath26 and upper critical field values .
[ ht ]     our experimental setup is a homemade calorimeter and its idealized heat - flow diagram is shown in fig.[fig2]a .
it consists of an oxygen - free , high - purity copper can which serves the role of a heat bath surrounding the sample .
a piece of high - purity copper wire is used as a heat link between the sample and heat bath and the mechanical support for the sample is provided by nylon rods . during measurements , the heat bath is maintained at a temperature of @xmath27 and a carbon glass thermometer ( lakeshore ) monitors its temperature . a second thermometer ( cernox , lakeshore ) is directly attached with silver epoxy to the lower end of the sample for reading the sample temperature .
to minimize electronic noise in reading the thermometer resistance , high - frequency sinusoidal excitation together with pulse - sensitive detection is used .
a manganin wire , which is non - inductively wound on the sample and secured with stycast epoxy , serves as a heater .
a 50-turn high - purity copper coil is directly wound on the sample for simultaneous ac magnetic susceptibility measurement . during measurements the vacuum in the calorimeter
is maintained to lower than @xmath28 by use of activated charcoal in thermal contact with the helium bath .
calorimetric measurements are performed with the standard heat - pulse technique .
the heat input to the sample is increased incrementally , with step duration of 60 - 100 sec .
every incremental increase of the heat input results in exponential temporal relaxation of the sample temperature to its new equilibrium value .
the sample heat capacity is determined through the decay time of the exponential .
this technique offers moderate resolution and is not suited for studying the thermodynamics of the peak effect .
nevertheless , it allows us to characterize our sample . in fig.[fig2]b
, we show the data acquired in zero applied field , from which we measured the sample properties quoted above .    during magnetocaloric measurements , a constant heat input , @xmath29 ,
is supplied to the sample through the manganin heater , fixing the temperature at a selected static value , @xmath11 . after the sample temperature has stabilized to @xmath11 ,
the magnetic field is ramped up , then down , at a constant rate . during a field ramp ,
the sample temperature as a function of field , @xmath30 , is recorded .
the magnetocaloric signal , @xmath31 , has to be measured with respect to a _ field dependent _ , static sample temperature _ reading _ : @xmath32 .
this is the thermometer reading obtained at a given field , @xmath33 , in the absence of field ramping .
in other words one has to determine @xmath34 .
an example of raw data , @xmath15 @xmath35 , is shown in fig.[fig3 ] .
the field dependence of the @xmath36 thermometer reading is a result of the following two effects : first , the magnetoresistance of the thermometer used .
second , a changing temperature gradient across the sample , as its field dependent thermal conductivity changes .
this gradient can become considerable in the meissner state for the highest measured temperatures ( @xmath37 at @xmath38 ) . nevertheless , it is negligible ( less than @xmath39 ) in the peak effect region which is the main focus of this paper .
we stress here that the thermal gradient is a result of the external heat input @xmath29 , not the magnetocaloric effect .        a possible variation of the heat input with applied field , which could be due to magnetoresistance in the heater ,
was investigated .
it was verified that the heat input from the manganin heater does not vary by more than 1 part in @xmath40 for the entire field range covered in any of our measurements .
the differential thermal conductance of the heat link between the sample and heat bath , @xmath14 to be used in eq.[eq2 ] above , is also measured at all temperatures of interest , for the entire range of applied fields .
this is done through application of a small , pulsed heat input ( @xmath41 ) to the sample and recording of the resulting temperature change , at different applied fields .
the link conductance is found to vary smoothly by no more than 1 part in 100 for the entire field range studied .
this variation is insignificant compared to the random noise in the raw @xmath15 data , and shall not be considered further .
finally , the field ramp rate is measured through a resistor connected in series with the magnet coil , which allows us to monitor the current through the magnet . for all of the measurements presented here
the ramp rate is @xmath42 , which is the lowest possible with our system . at higher ramp rates , for example @xmath43 ,
giant flux jumps occur in the sample .
in fig.[fig4]a&b , we summarize the molar entropy derivative , @xmath16 , measurements on increasing ( a ) and decreasing ( b ) fields , at different temperatures .
@xmath16 is calculated from the @xmath44 data following the procedure outlined above .
as indicated for the lowest temperature curve , @xmath45 ( the upper most curve in fig.[fig4]a ) several important features deserve attention .
on increasing fields a peak occurs at low field .
this is marked by .
it corresponds to the lowest field for vortex entry through a surface barrier .
its locus on the @xmath46 plane closely follows the thermodynamic field , but occurs slightly lower .
this behavior is expected for a sample with finite demagnetizing factor and mesoscopic surface irregularities.@xcite no corresponding peak is present on decreasing fields .
rather , a smoother increase of @xmath16 occurs as the field is lowered , before entry of part of the sample into the meissner state where the magnetocaloric signal vanishes , as seen in figures [ fig3]&[fig4]b .    in intermediate fields ,
we identify a novel feature which was not observed in previous magnetic susceptibility studies.@xcite this appears as a knee in @xmath16 , which shows larger negative slope as a function of field for fields lower than @xmath47 , as illustrated in fig.[fig4]c .
the feature is the same for both field - ramp directions . with our setup
we can identify the @xmath47 feature up to @xmath48 .
as the temperature is increased , the region between @xmath49 and @xmath2 narrows and it becomes increasingly difficult to discern @xmath47 .
thus it is unclear how this new feature terminates , i.e. whether it ends on the line at around @xmath50 , or if it continues to lower fields .    at high field , across @xmath2 , the equilibrium mean - field theory of abrikosov predicts a step function for @xmath51.@xcite thus , in the simplest picture one would expect a simple step function for the molar entropy derivative at @xmath2 .
instead , we observe that across the peak - effect regime , complex features of valley and peak appear in @xmath16 below the field marked .
the valley in @xmath16 corresponds to the peak effect , as seen in fig.[fig4 ] .
similar features appear in decreasing field . at fields above the peak effect , the disappearance of the magnetocaloric effect marks the upper critical field , .
as we will soon discuss , our magnetocaloric measurements indicate that the upper critical field shows inhomogeneity broadening , in agreement with the zero field calorimetric data mentioned in section [ sec2]c . in fig.[fig4 ] we mark with the upper end of the upper critical field .
this is the value of field at which the magnetocaloric signal in the mixed state exceeds noise levels .
our technique is not sensitive to @xmath0 effects and the data are featureless above .    [ !
tb ]        to verify the identification of the peak effect in our measurements , we performed simultaneous magnetocaloric and ac - susceptibility measurements , as shown in fig.[fig5]a .
in the quasi - adiabatic magnetocaloric setup , the ac - amplitude used in this procedure has to be small . for large amplitudes
inductive heating occurs in the mixed state on increasing _ dc _ field .
consequently the sample temperature increases rapidly by several degrees as the peak effect is crossed .
this behavior is not surprising , but reaffirms that caution has to be taken when dynamic perturbations are combined with quasi - adiabatic measurements .
we used an amplitude of @xmath52 at @xmath53 as a compromise between feasibility of the magnetocaloric measurement and resolution in the @xmath54 results .
the results are shown in fig.[fig5]a .    in this combined measurement
we find that both the onset and the peak of the peak effect have corresponding features .
moreover , we find no clear change in @xmath54 when the upper critical field , determined from the magnetocaloric measurement , is crossed .
a slight change occurs in the slope of the @xmath55 curve across , but significant amount of screening , caused by surface superconductivity , remains when the bulk of the sample is in the normal state .
this is a typical example of the inadequacy of ac - susceptometry in determining the upper critical field .
even with the use of larger ac fields the change in slope of @xmath55 turns into a shoulder which does not reveal the exact location or characteristics of the bulk superconducting transition.@xcite .      in light of the first - order transition underlying the peak effect , it is tempting to interpret the peak appearing in @xmath16 at the peak effect as a manifestation of the entropy discontinuity of the transition
. nevertheless , a simpler interpretation exists in the context of critical state screening .    in specific ,
the magnetocaloric signature of the peak effect is consistent with critical - state@xcite induced , non - equilibrium magnetization during the field ramps .
the magnetocaloric valley - and - peak features in the peak - effect regime allow us to determine the positions of the onset , , the peak , , and the end , @xmath56 , of the peak effect .
we start with increasing field data . at low temperatures below @xmath57 where the peak effect is observed ,
the magnetocaloric signal starts dropping at the onset , , of the peak effect .
a minimum occurs in the vicinity of the peak of the peak effect , , and it is followed by a peak , see fig.[fig5]b .
this indicates slowing down , then acceleration of vortex entry into the sample , as the critical state profile becomes steep , then levels , in the peak effect region .
finally the magnetocaloric signal gradually drops to zero in the region of the upper critical field .
on decreasing field a magnetically reversible region exists for fields between @xmath56 ( the `` end '' of the peak effect ) and .
this is shown in fig.[fig5]b .
such behavior can be understood keeping in mind that the upper critical field in our sample is characterized by inhomogeneity broadening .
we believe that the sliver of magnetic reversibility corresponds to the appearance of superconducting islands in our sample .
these give rise to magnetocaloric effects , but they are isolated within the bulk and can not support a screening supercurrent around the circumference of the sample , hence the reversible behavior .
the `` end '' of the peak effect marks the onset of irreversibility and corresponds to a shoulder in the decreasing field curve . in the critical state screening picture , this occurs when continuous superconducting paths form around the sample and a macroscopic critical current is supported .
as the field is lowered below @xmath56 , flux exit is delayed due to the increase in critical current , until past the peak of the peak effect , when accelerated flux exit results in a peak in @xmath16 below .
[ ht ]        in both field - ramp directions , the features due to the peak effect become less pronounced for higher temperatures , and finally disappear even before the previously identified@xcite critical point is reached . on increasing fields , for @xmath58
, a new peak appears in @xmath16 just below the critical field , shown in fig.[fig5]c .
this peak feature has already been reported in calorimetric measurements in pure nb and nb@xmath59sn.@xcite it has been attributed to critical fluctuations in the superconducting order parameter which set in as the critical field is approached.@xcite in our measurements we see the effect of critical - fluctuation entropy enhancement in . we expect the same peak to exist in the curves displaying the peak effect feature , but its presence will be obscured by the dramatic results of non - equilibrium magnetization discussed above .
interestingly a similar peak is _ not _ observed on the decreasing field data , fig.[fig5]c .
moreover , it is evident in fig.[fig5]c , that apart from hysteretic behavior over an approximately @xmath60 wide region between and the behavior of the sample is reversible to within noise levels .
this behavior occurs consistently at all temperatures where the peak effect is not observed .
a very striking feature of our data is the invariance of the shape of the transition into ( or out of ) the bulk normal state with changing temperature , or critical field . for increasing fields
, the transition into the normal state occurs between the fields and , where @xmath16 drops to zero monotonically , as shown in fig.[fig6]a . to illustrate this , in fig.[fig6 ]
we show the _ normalized _ entropy derivatives as a function of field for temperatures ranging from @xmath45 to @xmath38 , with an expanded view of the upper critical field region .
the normalization has been performed such that the average of @xmath61 over a @xmath62 wide region below the onset of the peak effect equals unity .
the curves have also been horizontally offset , on a @xmath63 axis .
the horizontal alignment can alternatively be performed by aligning the ordinate of either , or the part of the curve where the signal equals a given value , for example 0.1 in the normalized y axis .
all different criteria result in alignments differing by only a few oe . the case is similar for decreasing fields .    in fig.[fig6]a we present increasing field data that display the peak effect on the normalized / offset axes . for comparison , one curve which does not display the peak effect
has been included .
this corresponds to t=7.41k . in fig.[fig6]b
we present the corresponding decreasing field data .
in fig.[fig6]c we show only curves without a peak effect , for both increasing and decreasing field .
these figures illustrate the uniform characteristics of the transition between the mixed state and the normal state .
this is most evident in fig.[fig6]c : all different curves collapse onto one uniform curve for each field ramp direction . in figures
[ fig6]a&b , the occurrence of the peak effect results in variations of the magnetocaloric signal around this uniform transition .
these variations are , as already discussed , consistent with critical state induced flux screening on the field ramps .
the uniformity of the transition for all field values implies that critical fluctuation broadening of the transition plays a minor role in our sample .
rather , inhomogeneity broadening seems to be the cause for the observed behavior .    [ !
t ]       as already stated in sec.[sec2 ] , calorimetric measurements indicate inhomogeneity broadening to a width of approximately 83mk for the zero field transition in our sample . with this in mind , we conclude that for increasing fields the gradual disappearance of the magnetocaloric signal in the region between and corresponds to the gradual loss of bulk superconductivity in our sample . in all of our measurements ,
the width @xmath64 is essentially constant around a mean of @xmath65 ( fig.[fig6]a&c ) , which translates to a width of @xmath66 on the temperature axis .
this value is in good agreement with that obtained in the calorimetric measurement , given the finite temperature step of 10 to 15mk used in the latter .
based on the identification of the lower and upper limits of the upper critical field , we identify the location of the mean field transition , , to be in the midpoint of the to range , see fig.[fig6]a .
local variations in electronic properties in the sample cause broadening around this value . with this in mind
we proceed to the discussion of the evolution of the peak effect .
we already mentioned that in the magnetocaloric measurements the peak effect is not observed for temperatures above @xmath67 , or critical fields below @xmath68 .
the disappearance of the bulk peak effect at such high field seems to contradict the previous observation , from ac - susceptometry , that the peak effect occurs for fields as low as approximately @xmath69.@xcite our current findings offer a resolution of this controversy .    [ !
tb ]      to do this we trace the evolution of the positions of the onset and the peak of the peak effect versus in our increasing field data .
we focus on increasing fields , because in these the range of the upper critical field transition between and is clearly discernible .
the location of each of these features is identified by the intersection of two linear fits on different sections of the @xmath16 curve .
each fit is performed in a limited @xmath70 range on either side of the turning point where the feature occurs .
for example , is defined by the intersection of two linear fits to the data , one roughly in the range of to and one in the range of to . in fig .
[ fig7]a we show the positions of , @xmath47 , , and in @xmath33 vs. @xmath71 axes . in fig .
[ fig7]b we mark the positions of the onset , the peak , and the end of the peak effect , as well as the lower end ( ) and the midpoint ( ) of the transition in @xmath70 vs. axes .
it is evident in the figure that the peak effect disappears when it crosses over into the to range , where bulk superconductivity is partially lost due to sample inhomogeneity .
it is not clear whether the peak effect continues to exist with a reduced magnitude inside this region .
it seems likely that its magnitude is reduced below detectable levels .
this can be due to loss of superconductivity in regions of the sample and the resulting absence of bulk macroscopic critical current .
however the peak effect continues to manifest itself in ac - susceptibility .
this can be explained under the assumption that the screening supercurrent near the sample surface is assisted by the sheath of surface superconductivity .
this picture also provides an explanation for the approximately simultaneous disappearance of the peak effect and surface superconductivity in previous studies.@xcite    the observation with ac - susceptometry of a continuation of the peak effect line on the surface of the sample is an indication that the peak effect exists , though unobservable , at these lower fields , in isolated superconducting islands in the bulk of the sample as well .
moreover , as shown in fig .
[ fig7 ] , the linear extrapolation of the onset and the peak of the peak effect , as well as , merge at a field of approximately @xmath72 , suggesting that this may indeed be the vicinity of the critical point where the first - order phase transition underlying the peak effect ends .      the nature of the mcp which was previously identified by park _ _ et al.__@xcite remained unresolved .
our current findings suggest that surface superconductivity plays only a coincidental role in the disappearance of the peak effect .
thus , the nature of the mcp is determined from the nature of the and @xmath1 lines discussed in section [ sec1 ] .
we have a means of comparing the and @xmath1 transitions .
the approximate location of the mcp in ac - susceptometry is at @xmath738.1k , @xmath74900oe .
the disappearance of the peak effect below @xmath68 in the magnetocaloric measurements but only below approximately @xmath69 in ac - susceptometry , allows us to compare the transitions into the bulk normal state on the two sides of the mcp .
as shown in fig.[fig6]c , all the curves with @xmath75 ( or equivalently @xmath58 ) for both increasing and decreasing fields collapse strikingly on two different curves .
these data include transitions on both sides of the mcp .
this suggests that the phase transitions out of the bragg glass ( ) and disordered ( @xmath1 ) phases are of the same nature . in other words ,
well defined vortices exist in the disordered vortex state above the peak effect . here
`` well defined '' is taken to mean that their magnetocaloric signature is indistinguishable from the one obtained in the transition between the normal and the bragg glass phases .
however , it has to be borne in mind that changes in critical behavior can be subtle and hard to identify in our sample which shows significant inhomogeneity broadening .     for @xmath70 from @xmath76 to @xmath77 , for increasing ( @xmath78 ) and decreasing ( @xmath79 ) fields .
the peak effect feature was not observed at these temperatures .
the error bars reflect the uncertainty in alignment of the magnetocaloric curves .
temperatures above 8.15k correspond to the line of transitions proposed by park _
_ et al.__@xcite ]    we can overcome this difficulty and look for changes in critical behavior by integrating the normalized experimental curves . this way , a change or a trend in critical behavior obscured by inhomogeneity broadening will be more easily discerned as a trend in the computed integrals .
the computed integrals of the normalized increasing ( @xmath80 ) and decreasing ( @xmath81 ) field curves around the region of the upper critical field are shown in fig.[fig8 ] .
the integration has been performed between @xmath82 and @xmath83 in the aligned axis . more explicitly : @xmath84 the error bars arise from the alignment uncertainty .
all temperatures refer to the @xmath1 transition , except for the two marked with an asterisk which correspond to .
we see no systematic trend in the result in any of the available temperatures . in conclusion , as far as the inhomogeneity of our sample allows us to discern , there is no detectable change between the low - field @xmath2 transition and the high - field @xmath1 transition to the normal state .
finally , we discuss the `` end '' of the peak effect .
its position in the phase diagram is shown in fig.[fig7]b . in our data
@xmath56 occurs in a range between 32 and 39oe below and slightly above the position of the average superconducting transition , .
@xmath56 has been identified as the field at which a superconducting network which can support a macroscopic screening supercurrent forms inside the sample .
the `` end '' feature occurs slightly above the midpoint of the to range , as shown in fig.[fig7]b .
this indicates that the critical current appears when roughly half of the sample is in the mixed state while the rest is still in the normal state .
this observation is very interesting but requires further investigation .
the role of surface superconductivity in establishing macroscopic supercurrents in the superconducting network can be examined experimentally .
we can extend the conclusions from our measurements by evaluating the results of non - equilibrium and irreversible processes in the magnetocaloric effect .
we start with the surface barrier .
its presence results in delay of flux entry into the sample on increasing fields , up to a field approximately equal to the thermodynamic critical field , @xmath85.@xcite in addition , the surface barrier has the more subtle consequence of introducing an asymmetry between the measured on increasing and decreasing fields . on increasing fields , vortices have to enter the sample through an energy barrier in a vortex free region.@xcite in this process , energy is dissipated approximately at a rate @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the sample volume and @xmath85 the thermodynamic critical field .    in our measurements , for example at @xmath88 ,
this amounts to approximately @xmath89 , and will reduce the ( negative ) observed on increasing fields by roughly @xmath90 . on decreasing fields , the surface barrier has essentially no effect , and no irreversible heating is expected.@xcite an asymmetry of this kind is shown schematically in fig.[fig9]a , and it is present in our data , for example in fig.[fig5]b .
moreover , this type of asymmetry disappears for lower values of the critical field , where surface superconductivity has disappeared,@xcite for example in fig.[fig5]c .
flux flow heating of the sample also leads to a similar asymmetry between the ascending and descending field branches . on increasing fields the negative
is reduced and on decreasing fields the positive increased .
an order of magnitude estimate of flux - flow heating can be obtained on the basis of the bardeen - stephen model.@xcite for a cylindrical sample of radius @xmath91 , length @xmath92 , and for smooth field ramping at a rate @xmath9 , one obtains @xmath93 .
this turns out to be negligible for the field ramp rates , approximately 1oe / sec , used in our measurements .
we show the effect of this mechanism , grossly exaggerated , in fig.[fig9]b . between the above two sources of irreversible heating ,
it is clear that low field ramp rates will render the latter ( @xmath94 ) negligible , but will not reduce the effect of the former which scales as @xmath9 , as does the magnetocaloric .
[ ht ]     next we examine the case of a non - equilibrium critical state profile outside the peak effect region .
a critical current that monotonically decreases with field , i.e. away from the peak effect region , will result in the opposite asymmetry than the one just mentioned .
this is so , because on increasing fields the critical state profile becomes less steep , resulting in faster loss of flux than the field ramp rate , and thus increased .
the opposite occurs on decreasing fields , resulting in a lower than indicated by the equilibrium .
this mechanism is shown schematically in fig.[fig9]d . a simplified calculation for cylindrical sample geometry , like the ones found in the literature
, @xcite yields an asymmetry factor in equal to : @xmath95 for increasing ( @xmath96 ) and decreasing ( @xmath97 ) fields . here
, @xmath91 is the sample radius and @xmath98 the @xmath33 dependent critical current .
moreover it is assumed that the critical state field profile does not result in significant modification of the critical current in the sample interior . nevertheless , even in the case where the value of the critical current varies spatially inside the sample , @xmath99 , the same type of asymmetry results , with slightly modified value though .
the derivation of the above factor is outlined in the appendix .
this asymmetry is illustrated in fig.[fig9]c .
this type of asymmetry is only observed in our data in the region of the upper critical field and the peak effect .
for example , in data without peak effect , as shown in fig.[fig5]c , the magnetocaloric curves are reversible outside a region between and but consistently show hysteresis in that region , see also fig[fig6]b .
this behavior can be attributed to critical state screening .
then , the hysteresis which persists almost all the way up to indicates that the critical current is nonzero arbitrarily close to the upper critical field , and vanishes abruptly only at a distance of @xmath100 -@xmath77 from . in addition , the lack of asymmetry in the increasing and decreasing field curves below the hysteretic region , implies that the critical current density varies very weakly with applied field .
more specifically , the asymmetry in any of the data without peak effect is less than 5% of the magnitude of @xmath16 . by eq.[eq3 ] we obtain @xmath101 where the numerical result is expressed in conventional units for convenience .      from the measurements we can estimate the value of the critical current before it vanishes in the upper critical field region , in the context of critical state screening .
we assume that the entropy per vortex is essentially constant in the neighborhood of the upper critical field and the peak effect.@xcite therefore changes in magnetic flux ( @xmath102 ) are proportional to changes in entropy , @xmath103 .
then an integral of @xmath104 , such as @xmath80 and @xmath81 , can be approximately taken to represent a change in magnetic flux in the sample . in the critical state model
, we can relate changes in flux to the critical current .    at the temperatures where no peak effect is observed , we estimate the critical current in the neighborhood of . for simplicity
we consider a linear field profile in the sample , with slope @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the radial distance from the axis of the ( cylindrical ) sample . in the vicinity of simple integration
gives a macroscopic magnetic flux difference ( @xmath102 ) between the increasing and decreasing field branch approximately equal to : @xmath107 see eq.[eqa2 ] in the appendix .
due to the normalization performed for the integrals in fig.[fig8 ] the flux difference is also approximately given by : @xmath108 these two relations , allow us to obtain estimates for the critical current in the sample before this collapses to zero in the upper critical field region .
we show these in fig.[fig10 ] , for temperatures above 7k , corresponding to the symbol for @xmath109 .
one should note that critical currents with the values given for @xmath109 in the figure , will lead to radial variation of the induction inside the sample by roughly 10oe .
due to the constraint imposed on @xmath110 , ( see discussion above ) , the critical current density will vary inside the sample due to screened induction by less than 3.6a/@xmath111 .
this represents only 10% of its value , and thus the assumption that the slope of the critical state profile ( i.e. @xmath112 ) is essentially constant is self consistent .    a similar procedure can be followed for the curves showing the peak effect , in order to estimate the critical current at the peak of the peak effect .
this is most easily done for the decreasing field , curves , under the additional assumption that the critical current increases linearly from zero at @xmath56 to @xmath113 at .
the integration relating the screened flux ( @xmath102 ) to these three quantities leads to the rather complicated equation : @xmath114 where @xmath115 , @xmath116 .
the screened flux for a curve with peak effect is obtained via integration between and with respect to the universal curve of fig.[fig6]b ( bottom ) .
the resulting equations are solved numerically , and the results for @xmath113 are shown in fig.[fig10 ] .
the value at @xmath117 is not included , because the peak effect is barely observable at that temperature , which makes the procedure we outlined inapplicable .
we return to the low - field hysteresis near , illustrated in fig.[fig5]b .
the combination of hysteretic and reversible behavior in the vicinity of is striking .
furthermore this behavior persists in all of the measurements which do not show the peak effect , down to an upper critical field of @xmath118 .
in addition , we suggested earlier that the disappearance of the peak effect in our bulk measurements is due to loss of superconductivity in parts of the sample , while in ac - susceptometry it is due to the disappearance of surface superconductivity . thus the possibility arises that the peak effect continues to exist at low fields , but it is not observable with the techniques used so far . in other words ,
our data raise the question whether the hysteretic order - disorder transition reported previously@xcite continues down to low fields , where no peak effect is observed , but hysteresis occurs over a range too narrow to be detectable in neutron scattering . in this scenario ,
the hysteresis seen in fig.[fig5]c is related to a first order phase transition .
if this is the case the hysteresis presented here will be observable in high resolution calorimetric measurements .
finally we return to the newly identified `` knee '' feature , shown in fig.[fig4]c . from the occurrence of the knee in both ramp directions
we conclude that it corresponds to an equilibrium feature of the thermodynamic behavior inside the bragg glass phase . to appreciate this argument , note that all three sources of irreversible and non - equilibrium effects discussed at the beginning of this subsection , will induce asymmetry on the @xmath16 curves for opposite field - ramp directions . for example , the two curves of fig.[fig4]c show asymmetry , as already mentioned .
this is due to surface barrier - related heating on increasing field .
on the other hand , symmetric trends in the measured @xmath16 curves have to be related to equilibrium behavior , and we thus conclude that @xmath47 corresponds to an equilibrium feature .
neutron scattering did not reveal any structural changes in the vortex lattice@xcite around @xmath47 , which suggests that the nature of this feature is rather subtle
. it would be interesting to investigate the corresponding part of the phase diagram for changes in dynamical response , as well as for a possible relation of this novel feature to the thermomagnetic instability in nb .      from the reported magnetocaloric - effect results , we gain a significant amount of novel information about the nb sample previously studied using sans and ac - susceptometry .
the upper critical field shows significant inhomogeneity broadening .
the broad transition is related to the disappearance of the peak effect in bulk measurements .
the peak effect disappears in the phase diagram when it enters the range where regions of the sample are normal . yet , magnetic irreversibility , indicating nonzero critical currents , occurs when regions of the sample are normal .
the peak effect is observable with ac - susceptometry at fields much lower than with magnetocaloric measurements . in the former case screening
occurs locally , near the surface,@xcite presumably assisted by a superconducting surface layer .
this could indicate that the peak effect still occurs in the bulk of the sample in regions that are superconducting .
the low field transition from the bragg glass phase into the normal state seems to be the same as the high field transition between the structurally disordered@xcite vortex state and the normal state .
moreover , hysteresis occurs in magnetocaloric curves that do not display the peak effect , but in the neighborhood of this hysteresis the non - equilibrium and irreversible effect signatures that we discussed are absent . finally a new feature corresponding to a knee in the magnetocaloric coefficient has been identified and its position mapped out in the phase diagram , fig .
these new findings allow us to refine the previously proposed peak effect phase diagram ( fig.[fig1 ] ) , but also point to an alternative picture .    in the multicritical point picture ,
the magnetocaloric - effect results reported here have strong implications for understanding the nature of the multicritical point where the peak effect disappears.@xcite a tricritical point can be ruled out since the change in slope between the and low field lines would lead to violation of the 180@xmath119 rule@xcite imposed by thermodynamics .
the fact that the magnetocaloric transition appears to be continuous and of the same character across both @xmath120 and @xmath121 , suggests that the critical point is bicritical .
bicriticality implies the competition of two bulk vortex phases , an ordered bragg glass@xcite and a disordered vortex glass .
the vortex glass phase is not necessarily superconducting in the sense of the original proposal,@xcite but it has to be a genuine phase possessing an order parameter absent in the normal state,@xcite and _ in competition _ with that of the bragg glass . in addition , it possesses superconducting phase rigidity even under partial loss of bulk ( mixed state ) superconductivity .
finally , we wish to discuss an alternative picture in which the order - disorder transition does not end at the previously identified critical point
. the experimental disappearance of the peak effect in magnetocaloric measurements may be due to sample inhomogeneity .
in addition , the peak effect disappears in ac - susceptometry due to the disappearance of surface superconductivity.@xcite nevertheless , the vortex lattice disordering transition can continue to lower fields , where the peak effect is not detectable .
hysteresis related to a first order phase transition occurs over a narrow range in this part of the phase diagram , and the width of the hysteresis region grows appreciably only at higher fields where the peak effect is sufficiently far from the region . in this picture , no critical point associated with the disordering transition exists at any finite field or temperature.@xcite
we have identified the magnetocaloric signatures of the peak effect in a nb single crystal .
in addition we classified and outlined the various sources of irreversible and non - equilibrium effects occurring in such measurements and offered ways for their evaluation . with these in mind
, magnetocaloric measurements prove very useful in studies of the mixed state .
they are suitable for studying the upper critical field region .
they allow the identification and study of dynamical effects , such as the onset , the peak and the end of the peak effect , and provide estimates of the critical currents involved
. moreover they are useful in identification of changes in thermodynamic behavior deeper inside the mixed state , e.g. the `` knee '' feature identified here .    with the wealth of novel information obtained in our measurements we were able to shed light into the diasppearance of the peak effect in nb .
we refined the multicritical point scenario drawn previously.@xcite in addition , based on experimental facts , we proposed an alternative scenario which can be experimentally tested .

first we derive the critical state asymmetry factor of @xmath16 discussed in section [ sec3b ] .
we limit our discussion to cylindrical sample geometry , with the field applied along the cylindrical axis .
the critical current is taken to depend on @xmath122 , or equivalently on @xmath33 .
we focus on the region close to , where these are linearly related by : @xmath123 , with @xmath124.@xcite due to critical current screening , the local induction ( or field ) inside the sample is modified with respect to the applied field and depends on radial distance from the axis ( @xmath106 ) of the sample : @xmath125 . from the ampre law the field variation resulting from the critical current is : @xmath126 for increasing ( @xmath97 ) and decreasing ( @xmath96 ) field .
the critical current depends on @xmath122 , but we make the simplifying assumption that for a given value of applied field @xmath127 , the local induction inside the sample leads to a negligible critical current variation : @xmath128 . in addition
we neglect demagnetizing effects .
we then obtain : @xmath129 where @xmath91 is the sample radius and again the solutions correspond to increasing ( @xmath97 ) and decreasing ( @xmath96 ) field .
the corresponding magnetic induction is simply : @xmath130 this is easily integrated over the cross sectional area of the sample , in order to obtain the magnetic flux through the sample : @xmath131 to yield : @xmath132 note that here the significance of the signs is reversed for increasing ( @xmath96 ) and decreasing ( @xmath97 ) field . the rate of change in magnetic flux through the sample for changes in applied field is : @xmath133 this is proportional to the magnetocaloric signal , and includes the asymmetry factor given in eq.[eq3 ] , with negative ( @xmath96 ) sign for increasing field , positive ( @xmath97 ) for decreasing .      the critical current between and @xmath56 is taken to be : @xmath134 then the ampre law for the field ( @xmath135 ) inside the sample is : @xmath136 this is solved for applied field @xmath137 , with the boundary condition @xmath138 ( again by neglecting demagnetizing effects ) , and yields : @xmath139 with @xmath140 . from this ,
the local induction is obtained , and via integration over the sample cross - section , see eq.[eqa1 ] the magnetic flux through the sample is : @xmath141 where we used the notation @xmath142 . the flux in the absence of screening ( @xmath143 ) is : @xmath144 therefore the amount of screened flux @xmath145 , turns out to be : @xmath146 the additional definition @xmath147 , straightforwardly leads to eq.[eq4 ] : @xmath148 +   +   +   +      a. i. larkin , sov .

 the thermomagnetic effects due to vortex flow into and out of the sample are measured . 
 the magnetocaloric signature of the peak effect anomaly is identified . 
 it is found that the peak effect disappears in magnetocaloric measurements at fields significantly higher than those reported in previous ac - susceptometry measurements . 
 investigation of the superconducting to normal transition reveals that the disappearance of the bulk peak effect is related to inhomogeneity broadening of the superconducting transition . 
 the emerging picture also explains the concurrent disappearance of the peak effect and surface superconductivity , which was reported previously in the sample under investigation . based on our findings 
 we discuss the possibilities of multicriticality associated with the disappearance of the peak effect . "
"understanding the emergence and persistence of cooperation is one of the central problems in evolutionary biology and socioeconomics @xcite . in investigating this problem
the standard framework utilized is evolutionary game theory @xcite .
especially two models , the prisoner s dilemma @xcite and its variation , the snowdrift game @xcite , have attracted most attention . in both games , the players can either cooperate for common good , or defect and exploit other players in attempt to gain benefits individually . in the prisoner
s dilemma , the precondition is that it pays off to be non - cooperative . because of this , defection is the only evolutionarily stable strategy ( ess ) in populations which are fully mixed , i.e. where each player interacts with any other player @xcite .
however , several models which are extensions of the prisoner s dilemma have proved to sustain cooperation .
these models include those in which the players are assumed to have memory of the previous interactions @xcite , or characteristics that allow cooperators and defectors to distinguish each other @xcite , or players are spatially distributed @xcite .
a typical spatial game is such where player - player interactions only take place within restricted neighborhoods on regular lattices @xcite or on complex networks @xcite .
these games have been found to generate highly complex behavior and enable the persistence of cooperation . regarding the latter ,
the opposite was recently seen in the case of the snowdrift game played on a two - dimensional lattice @xcite , where the spatial structure resulted in decreased cooperator densities compared to the fully mixed `` mean - field '' case .
this result was surprising , as intermediate levels of cooperation persist in unstructured snowdrift games , and the common belief has been that spatial structure is usually beneficial for sustained levels of cooperation .    in these studies
the viewpoint has largely been that of biological evolution , as represented by the so - called _ replicator dynamics _
@xcite , where the fraction of players who use high - payoff - strategies grow ( stochastically ) in the population proportionally to the payoffs .
this mechanism can be viewed as depicting darwinian evolution , where the fittest have the largest chance of survival and reproduction .
overall , the factors influencing the outcomes of these spatially structured games are ( i ) the rules determining the payoffs ( e.g. ref .
@xcite ) , ( ii ) the topology of the spatial structure ( e.g. ref .
@xcite ) , and ( iii ) the rules determining the evolution of each player s strategy ( e.g. ref .
we have studied the effect of changing the strategy evolution rules ( iii ) in the two - dimensional snowdrift game similar to that discussed in ref .  @xcite . in our version ,
the rules have been defined in such a way that changes in the players strategies represent player _ decisions _ instead of different strategy genotypes in the next evolutionary generation of players .
thus , the time scale of the population dynamics in our model can be viewed to be much shorter than evolutionary time scales . instead of utilizing the evolution - inspired replicator dynamics ,
we have endowed the players with primitive `` intelligence '' in the form of local decision - making rules determining their strategies .
we show with simulations and analytic approach that these rules result in cooperation levels which differ largely from those obtained using the replicator dynamics .    in this study we will concentrate on an adaptive snowdrift game , with agents interacting with their nearest neighbor agents on a two - dimensional square lattice . in what follows
we first describe our spatial snowdrift model and then analyze its equilibrium states .
next we present our simulation results and finally draw some conclusions .
the snowdrift model can be illustrated with a situation in which two cars are caught in a blizzard and there is a snowdrift blocking their way .
the cars are equipped with shovels , and the drivers have two choices : either start shoveling the road open or remain in the car .
if the road is cleared , both drivers gain the benefit @xmath1 of getting home . on the other hand
, clearing the road requires some work , and cost @xmath2 can be assigned to it ( @xmath3 ) .
if both drivers are cooperative and willing to shovel , this workload is shared between them , and both of them gain total benefit of @xmath4 .
if both choose to defect , i.e. remain in their cars , neither one gets home and thus both obtain zero benefit @xmath5 . if only one of the drivers shovels , both get home , but
the defector avoids the cost and gains benefit @xmath6 , whereas the cooperator s benefit is reduced by the workload , i.e. @xmath7 .    the above described situation can be presented with the bi - matrix @xcite ( table [ payoffs ] ) , where @xmath8 in case of the so called one - shot game , each player has two available strategies , namely defect ( d ) or cooperate ( c ) .
the players choose their strategies simultaneously , and their individual payoffs are given by the appropriate cell of the bi - matrix . by convention ,
the payoff to the so - called row player is the first payoff given , followed by the payoff of the column player .
thus , if for example player 1 chooses d and player 2 chooses c , then player 1 receives the payoff t and player 2 the payoff s.    the best action depends on the action of the co - player such that defect if the other player cooperates and cooperate if the other defects .
a simple analysis shows that the game does not have _ stable evolutionary strategy _
@xcite , if the agents use only pure strategies , i.e. , they can choose either to cooperate or to defect with probability one , but they are not allowed to use a strategy which mixes either of these actions with some probability @xmath9 .
this leads to stable existence of cooperators and defectors in well - mixed populations @xcite .
lll & d & c + d & p , p & t , s + c & s , t & r , r +    in order to study the effect of spatial structure on the snowdrift game , we set the players on a regular two - dimensional square lattice consisting of @xmath10 cells .
we adopt the notation of ref .
( @xcite ) and identify each cell by an index @xmath11 which also refers to its spatial position . each cell , representing a player , is characterized by its strategy @xmath12 , which can be either to cooperate ( @xmath13 ) or to defect ( @xmath14 ) .
the spatio - temporal distribution of the players is then described by @xmath15 which is an element of a @xmath16 dimensional hypercube
. then every player  henceforth called an _ agent _  interacts with their @xmath17 nearest neighbors .
we use either the moore neighborhood in which case each agent has @xmath18 neighbors , in n , ne , e , se , s , sw , w and nw , or the von neumann neighborhood in which case each agent has @xmath19 neighbors , in n , e , s and w compass directions @xcite .
we require that an agent plays _ simultaneously _ with all its @xmath17 neighbors , and define the payoffs for this @xmath20 game such that an agent @xmath21 who interacts with @xmath22 cooperators and @xmath23 defectors , @xmath24 , gains a benefit of @xmath25 from defecting or cooperating , respectively .    for determining their strategies ,
the agents are endowed with primitive decision - making capabilities .
the agents retain no memory of the past , and are not able to predict how the strategies of the neighboring agents will change .
every agent simply assumes that the strategies of other agents within its neighborhood remain fixed , and chooses an action that maximizes its own payoff . in this sense
the agents are myopic . the payoff is maximized , if an agent ( a ) defects when @xmath26 , and ( b ) cooperates when @xmath27 .
if ( c ) @xmath28 the situation is indifferent . using eqs .
( [ neiguta ] ) and ( [ neigutb ] ) we can connect the preferable choice of an agent and the payoffs of the game .
let us denote @xmath29 then , if @xmath30    thus , for each individual agent , the ratio @xmath31 determines a following decision - boundary @xmath32 which depends on the neighborhood size @xmath17 and the `` temptation '' parameter @xmath31 . because @xmath31 is determined only by the differences @xmath33 and @xmath34 , we can fix two of the payoff values , say @xmath35 and @xmath5 .
based on the above , we define the following rules for the agents :    1 .   if an agent @xmath21 plays at time @xmath36 a strategy @xmath37 for which @xmath38 , then at time @xmath39 the agent plays @xmath40 .
if an agent @xmath21 plays at time @xmath36 a strategy @xmath37 for which @xmath41 , then at time @xmath39 the agent plays @xmath42 with probability @xmath0 , and @xmath43 with probability @xmath44 .    hence , the strategy evolution of an individual agent is determined by the current strategies of the other agents within its neighborhood , with the parameter @xmath0 acting as a `` regulator '' which moderates the rate of changes .
a spatial game is in stable state or equilibrium if retaining the current strategy is beneficial for all the agents  @xcite .
there can be numerous equilibrium configurations , depending on the temptation parameter @xmath31 , geometry and size of the @xmath17-neighborhood , and the size and boundary conditions of the lattice upon which the game is played .
an aggregate quantity of particular interest is the fraction of cooperators @xmath45 in the whole population ( or , equivalently , that of the defectors @xmath46 ) .
below , we derive limits for @xmath45 , first in a `` mean - field '' picture based cooperator densities within neighborhoods and then by investigating local neighborhood configurations .      without detailed knowledge of local equilibrium configurations
we can already derive some limits for the fraction of cooperators in equilibrium .
let us consider a square lattice with @xmath47 cells with periodic boundary conditions , where @xmath48 is the linear size of the lattice , and assume that @xmath49 cells are occupied by cooperators .
we denote by @xmath50 the number of those agents who have @xmath51 cooperators each in their @xmath17-neighborhood , excluding the agents themselves , and denote the local density of cooperators in such neighborhoods by @xmath52 .
hence , the total amount of cooperators @xmath49 can be written in terms of the densities as follows    @xmath53    from eqs .
( [ boundarya])-([boundaryc ] ) we can infer that a cooperator will retain its current strategy , if it has at most @xmath2 cooperators in its @xmath17-neighborhood , where @xmath2 is the integer part of @xmath54 .
similarly , a defector will remain a defector if it has more than @xmath2 cooperators in its neighborhood .
thus , in equilibrium , all agents having @xmath55 cooperators in their neighborhood are likewise cooperators , and thus @xmath56 .
we denote by @xmath57 the average density of cooperators as the nearest neighbors of cooperators .
similarly , @xmath58 denotes the average density of cooperators as the nearest neighbors of defectors , i.e. @xmath59
. then we can write eq .
( [ id1 ] ) as @xmath60    the density @xmath61 of cooperators around each cooperator is bounded : @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and as @xmath64 , the relation @xmath65 holds for the average density .
similarly , the density of cooperators around each defector @xmath66 can be at most @xmath67 and is at least @xmath68 , and thus the average density @xmath69 . using these relations together with eq .
( [ id2 ] ) we obtain the following limits for the density of cooperators @xmath70 in the whole agent population ( see also fig .  [ fig1 ] ) : @xmath71      in the above derivation we ignore how the strategies can actually be distributed in the lattice .
hence , it is of interest to examine possible local equilibrium configurations of the player strategies .
again , eqs .
( [ boundarya])-([boundaryc ] ) tell us how many cooperative neighbors each defector or cooperator can have in the equilibrium state .
the number of cooperators around each agent depends on the value of the temptation parameter @xmath31 , and for a given value of @xmath31 the lattice has to be filled such that these conditions hold for the neighborhood of each agent . in a lattice with periodic boundary conditions , the lattice size @xmath72 and the neighborhood size
@xmath17 obviously have an effect on the elementary configurations .
hence , we restrict ourselves to infinite - sized lattices , filled by repeating elementary configuration blocks , and look for the resulting limits on the cooperator density @xmath45 .
note that these conclusions also hold for finite lattices with periodic boundary conditions , if @xmath73 and @xmath74 are integer multiples of @xmath75 and @xmath76 , respectively , where @xmath77 is the elementary block size . here
, we will restrict the analysis to the case of the moore neighborhood with @xmath18 .
lllccll i & @xmath78 & @xmath79 & @xmath80 & @xmath81 & @xmath82 & @xmath83 + 1&@xmath84 & @xmath85 & 8 & 7 & @xmath86 & @xmath87 + 2&@xmath85 & @xmath88 & 7 & 6 & @xmath89 & @xmath90 + 3&@xmath88 & @xmath91 & 6 & 5 & @xmath92 & @xmath89 + 4&@xmath91 & @xmath93 & 5 & 4 & @xmath92 & @xmath89 + 5&@xmath93 & @xmath94 & 4 & 3 & @xmath95 & @xmath92 + 6&@xmath94 & @xmath96 & 3 & 2 & @xmath97 & @xmath92 + 7&@xmath96 & @xmath98 & 2 & 1 & @xmath99 & @xmath97 + 8&@xmath98 & @xmath100 & 1 & 0 & @xmath101 & @xmath102 +    as an example , consider the local configurations when @xmath103 , and hence the decision boundary value @xmath104 .
thus , from eqs .
( [ boundarya])-([boundaryc ] ) one can infer that in equilibrium all defectors should have more than @xmath105 cooperators in their moore neighborhoods . because the number of cooperating neighbors can take only integer values
, this means that every one of the @xmath18 neighbors of a defector should be a cooperator . on the other hand , from eqs .
( [ boundarya])-([boundaryc ] ) we see that the density @xmath61 of cooperators around each cooperator should be less than @xmath106 , i.e. they should have at most @xmath107 cooperators in their moore neighborhood .
the smallest repeated elementary block fulfilling both conditions is a @xmath108-square with one defector 
when the lattice is filled with these blocks , the cooperator density equals @xmath109 ( see fig .
( [ fig2 ] ) , case 1 , left block ) . on the other hand ,
both requirements are likewise fulfilled with a repeated @xmath110-square , where the central cell is a defector and the rest are cooperators , resulting in the cooperator density of @xmath111 .
this configuration is illustrated in fig .
( [ fig2 ] ) , as case 1 , right block .    by continuing the analysis of elementary configuration blocks in similar fashion for different values of @xmath31
, we obtain lower and upper limits for the fraction of cooperators , which are listed in table [ tab1 ] .
the corresponding elementary configuration blocks are depicted in fig .
( [ fig2 ] ) .
the table is read so that when the value of the temptation parameter is within the interval @xmath112 , the number of cooperators in each defector s neighborhood @xmath113 must be at least @xmath114 and the number of cooperators in each cooperator s neighborhood @xmath115 can be at most @xmath116 . here
@xmath117 , @xmath118 and @xmath119 these conditions are those of eqs .
( [ boundarya])-([boundaryc ] ) and they are fulfilled by the configuration blocks depicted in fig .
( [ fig2 ] ) , for which the minimum and maximum densities of cooperators are @xmath82 and @xmath83 .
we have studied the above described spatial snowdrift model with discrete time - step simulations on a @xmath120-lattice with periodic boundary conditions . we have specifically analyzed the behavior of the cooperator density @xmath45 , and equilibrium lattice configurations . in the simulations ,
the lattice is initialized randomly so that each cell contains a cooperator or defector with equal probability .
however , biasing the initial densities toward cooperators or defectors was found to have no considerable effect on the outcome of the game .
we have simulated the game using both the moore and the von neumann neighborhoods with @xmath18 and @xmath19 nearest neighbors , respectively . in the simulations we update strategies of the agents asynchronously @xcite with the random sequential update scheme , so that during one simulation round , every agent s strategies are updated in random order . in the following
, the time scale is defined in terms of these simulation rounds .
first , we have studied the development of the cooperator density @xmath45 as a function of time . as expected
, the probability @xmath0 of discontent agents changing their strategies plays the role of defining the convergence time scale only would be more important if synchronous update rules were used . in that case
@xmath121 corresponds to a situation where each discontent agent simultaneously changes its strategy to the opposite .
this , then , could result in a frustrated situation with oscillating cooperator density .
however , small enough values of @xmath0 should damp these oscillations , resulting in static equilibrium .
] , as in the long run @xmath45 converges to a stable value irrespective of @xmath0 .
this is depicted in fig .
[ fig3 ] , which shows @xmath45 as function of time for several values of @xmath0 and two different values of the temptation @xmath31 . in these runs , we have used the moore neighborhood , i.e. @xmath18 . in all the studied cases , @xmath45 turns out to converge quite rapidly to a constant value , @xmath122 for @xmath123 and @xmath124 for @xmath125 .
it should be noted that @xmath45 does not have to converge to exactly the same stable value for the same @xmath31 ; even if the game is considered to be in equilibrium , there can be some variance in @xmath45 , which is also visible in fig .
however , the value of @xmath45 was found to eventually remain stable during individual runs , i.e. no oscillations were detected .
next , we have studied the average equilibrium fraction of cooperators @xmath126 in the agent population as function of the temptation parameter @xmath31 . we let the simulations run for 500 rounds ( with @xmath127 ) , and averaged the fraction of cooperators for the subsequent 500 rounds . in all cases , the fraction had already converged before the averaging rounds .
( [ fig4 ] ) shows the results for the von neumann neighborhood ( @xmath19 ) , illustrated as the squares .
the dotted lines indicate the upper and lower limits of eq .
( [ loup ] ) , and the dashed diagonal line is @xmath128 , corresponding to the fraction of cooperators in the fully mixed case  @xcite . the fraction of cooperators @xmath129 is seen to follow a stepped curve , with steps corresponding to @xmath130 , where @xmath131 .
this is a natural consequence of eqs .
( [ boundarya])-([boundaryc ] ) , where the decision boundary @xmath54 can take only discrete values .
a similar picture is given for the moore neighborhood ( @xmath18 ) in the middle panel of fig .
( [ fig5 ] ) .
furthermore , in the middle panel of fig .
( [ fig5 ] ) the values of @xmath45 fall between the limits given in table [ tab1 ] for all @xmath31 as shown with solid lines .    in both cases ( i.e. with moore and von neumann neighborhoods ) cooperation
is seen to persist during the whole range @xmath132 $ ] .
this result differs largely from the @xmath133-curves of the spatial snowdrift game with replicator dynamics  @xcite , where the fraction of cooperators vanished at some critical @xmath134 .
hence , we argue that no conclusions on the effect of spatiality on the snowdrift game can be drawn without taking into consideration the strategy evolution mechanism ; local decision - making in a restricted neighborhood yields results which are different from those resulting from the evolutionary replicator dynamics .
we have also studied the equilibrium lattice configurations for various values of @xmath31 .
( [ fig5 ] ) depicts the central part of the @xmath135-lattice after 1000 simulation rounds using the moore neighborhood and @xmath127 , with white pixels corresponding to cooperators and black pixels to defectors .
the values of @xmath31 have been selected so that the equilibrium situation corresponds to each plateau of @xmath129 illustrated in the central panel .
the observed configurations are rather polymorphic , and repeating elementary patterns like those in fig .
( [ fig2 ] ) are not seen .
this reflects the fact that the local equilibrium conditions can be satisfied by various configurations ; the random initial configuration and the asynchronous update then lead to irregular - looking equilibrium patterns , which vary between simulation runs .
the patterns seem to be most irregular when @xmath31 is around 0.5 ; this is because then the equilibrium numbers of cooperators and defectors are close to each other , and the ways to assign strategies within local neighborhoods are most numerous . to be more exact ,
there are @xmath136 ways to distribute @xmath21 cooperators in the @xmath137-neighborhood , and if e.g. @xmath138 , @xmath21 is at least @xmath139 and at most @xmath140 , maximizing the value of the binomial coefficient .
hence , the ways of filling the lattice with these neighborhoods in such a way that the equilibrium conditions are satisfied everywhere are most numerous as well .
we have presented a variant of the two - dimensional snowdrift game , where the strategy evolution is determined by agent decisions based on the strategies of other players within its local neighborhood .
we have analyzed the lower and upper bounds for equilibrium cooperator densities with a mean - field approach as well as considering possible lattice - filling elementary configuration blocks .
we have also shown with simulations that this game converges to equilibrium configurations with constant cooperator density depending on the payoff parameters , and that these densities fall within the derived limits .
furthermore , the strategy configurations in the equilibrium state display interesting patterns , especially for intermediate temptation parameter values .
most interestingly , the equilibrium cooperator densities differ largely from those resulting from applying the replicator dynamics  @xcite . with our strategy evolution rules
, cooperation persists through the whole temptation parameter range .
this illustrates that one can not draw general conclusions on the effect of spatiality on the snowdrift game without taking the strategy evolution mechanisms into consideration 
this should , in principle , apply for other spatial games as well .
care should especially be taken when interpreting the results of investigations on such games : the utilized strategy evolution mechanism should reflect the system under study .
we argue that especially when modeling social or economic systems , there is no _ a priori _ reason to assume that generalized conclusions can be drawn based on results using the evolution inspired replicator dynamics approach , where high - payoff strategies get copied and `` breed '' in proportion to their fitness . as we have shown here , local decision - making with limited information ( neighbor strategies are known payoffs are not ) can result in different outcome ." ," we have studied a spatially extended snowdrift game , in which the players are located on the sites of two - dimensional square lattices and repeatedly have to choose one of the two strategies , either cooperation ( c ) or defection ( d ) . 
 a player interacts with its nearest neighbors only , and aims at playing a strategy which maximizes its instant pay - off , assuming that the neighboring agents retain their strategies . 
 if a player is not content with its current strategy , it will change it to the opposite one with probability @xmath0 next round . here 
 we show through simulations and analytical approach that these rules result in cooperation levels , which differ to large extent from those obtained using the replicator dynamics . "
"polycrystalline samples of ba@xmath1k@xmath2fe@xmath3as@xmath3 were prepared by a solid state reaction method similar to that reported by chen _ _ et al__@xcite .
first , fe@xmath3as , baas , and kas were prepared from high purity as ( 99.999% ) , fe ( 99.9% ) , ba ( 99.9% ) and k ( 99.95% ) in evacuated quartz ampoules at 800 , 650 and 500@xmath22c respectively .
next , the terminal compounds bafe@xmath3as@xmath3 and kfe@xmath3as@xmath3 were synthesized at 950 and 700@xmath22c respectively , from stoichiometric amounts of baas or kas and fe@xmath3as in alumina crucibles sealed in evacuated quartz ampoules . finally , 11 samples of ba@xmath1k@xmath23fe@xmath3as@xmath3 with @xmath4 = 0 to 1.0 were prepared from appropriate amounts of single - phase bafe@xmath3as@xmath3 and kfe@xmath3as@xmath3 .
the components were mixed , pressed into pellets , placed into alumina crucibles and sealed in evacuated quartz tubes .
the samples were annealed for 50 h at 700@xmath22c with one intermediate grinding , and were characterized by room temperature powder x - ray diffraction using cu k@xmath24 radiation .
the diffraction patterns were indexed on the basis of the tetragonal thcr@xmath3si@xmath3 type structure ( space group i4/mmm ) .

the linear changes in lattice parameters with @xmath4 suggest that there is little difference between the nominal and actual k concentration in the samples .

the samples for heat capacity measurement were cut from the larger pellets using a diamond wheel saw , and weighed approximately 0.8 g .

the total specific heat coefficient @xmath26 can be written as @xmath27 , where @xmath16 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , represent the electronic , phonon and anharmonic contributions respectively ( see fig .
[ gphfig ] ) . here
@xmath30 and @xmath31 .
differential measurements of ba@xmath1k@xmath2fe@xmath3as@xmath3 ( see fig .  [ gammafig](a ) ) between each sample and the @xmath4 = 0 reference give @xmath32 ( assuming that @xmath33 = 0 ) , where @xmath34 is a bell shaped curve peaking typically at around 30 - 40k and varying as @xmath35 at low temperatures and @xmath36 at high temperatures@xcite . within a single crystallographic phase @xmath37 is generally found to be a separable function of @xmath4 and @xmath5 , i.e. @xmath38 , and is thus a universal function of @xmath5 , scaling in magnitude with changes in @xmath4 @xcite .
a simple calculation shows that this separable form is expected for phonon shifts of up to @xmath39 .
if the shifts have a linear doping dependence @xmath40 , then @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the einstein specific heat function for a single harmonic oscillator and @xmath43 is the phonon density of states .
higher order corrections @xmath44 will only arise if @xmath45 is non - linear in @xmath46 , or for very large frequency shifts .
this simple separable behaviour greatly increases the reliability of the correction for @xmath4-dependent changes in phonon specific heat . to correct @xmath47 for the doping dependent changes in the phonon term
we must first determine @xmath48 .
inspection of fig .
[ gammafig](a ) reveals a systematic negative peak at 35k which grows with @xmath4 , and is consistent with an increase in phonon frequencies expected from the substitution of heavier ba by lighter k. a simple estimate of average fractional phonon shifts using the approximate relation @xmath49 yields @xmath50 over the range @xmath51 and @xmath52 over the range @xmath53 .
a suitable @xmath48 was constructed to remove this peak for each phase , the criterion being that after applying the correction , no evidence for the broad 35k peak should be visible in any of the corrected curves . for the tetragonal phase @xmath53
this was achieved by scaling the correction curve @xmath54 , shown in the inset to fig .
[ gammafig](a ) , linearly with doping . in the magnetically ordered orthorhombic phase @xmath55
, the phonon correction @xmath56 has a @xmath5-dependence similar to @xmath54 , but scales sub - linearly with increasing @xmath4 .
this sub - linear doping dependence correlates with the decrease of the spin - density - wave ( sdw ) order parameter with @xmath4 , suggesting that magneto - phonon coupling is important in the magnetically ordered phase . to ensure that each resulting @xmath48 has a @xmath5-dependence compatible with that of a phonon spectrum
it was modelled with a histogram for the difference phonon spectrum with a fixed fractional bin width @xmath57 , as discussed previously@xcite .    after applying the phonon correction @xmath37 to @xmath58 for all our samples we obtain the difference of electronic terms @xmath59 between @xmath4 and @xmath4 = 0 . to obtain the electronic term for each sample from this differential data
requires that @xmath60 for one sample is known or assumed , and for this we choose the @xmath4 = 0.3 sample . after removing the broad negative peak in @xmath47 at 35k for this sample @xmath61
has an additional negative @xmath5-dependence given by @xmath18 @xmath62 mj / mol k@xmath63 in the range 40 to 110k .
the negative curvature of this term , already evident above 80k in the raw @xmath47 data shown in fig .
[ gammafig](a ) , continues to increase in magnitude up to 136k and then abruptly vanishes at the magneto - structural transition .
for this reason we associate it with the @xmath5-dependence of the electronic and magnetic ( magnon ) specific heat coefficient @xmath64 of the undoped sample in the sdw phase . from @xmath61 a roughly @xmath5-independent normal - state @xmath65 below @xmath66 of 47mj mol@xmath19 k@xmath20 is inferred from the entropy conservation constraint between normal and superconducting states .
finally , we note that the low temperature value for @xmath65 is very close to its high temperature value @xmath18 50mj mol@xmath19 k@xmath20 determined directly from the difference between @xmath67 and the saturation value of @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the number of atoms per formula unit .
we therefore assume that @xmath65 is approximately @xmath5-independent over the entire range , and choose the @xmath70 for @xmath4 = 0.3 to be the `` known reference '' .
the electronic term @xmath71 for all other samples is then calculated from @xmath72 .
final curves for @xmath71 are shown in fig .
[ gammafig](b ) .
it is important to note that any error in our assumption that @xmath73 for @xmath4 = 0.3 is approximately @xmath5-independent will affect equally the resulting curves for @xmath60 for all other dopings and will have no effect on differences in @xmath60 between samples .
the fact that all the curves for @xmath60 vary smoothly with temperature with no sign of the phonon correction or the large 135k anomaly present in the raw data ( fig .
[ gammafig](a ) ) provides confidence in the corrections and procedure discussed above and in the accuracy and reproducibility of the raw differential data .    with the electronic terms in hand we are able to determine the phonon terms in @xmath74 directly and without resorting to arbitrary polynomial fits . the total specific heat ( @xmath75 ) and phonon terms at constant pressure ( @xmath76 ) and constant volume ( @xmath77 ) are shown in fig .  [ gphfig ] for @xmath4 = 0.3 .
the anharmonic term is given by@xcite @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the molar volume , @xmath80 is the bulk modulus and @xmath81 is the volume expansion coefficient .
we assume that @xmath29 is doping independent and use @xmath79 = 61 @xmath82 mol@xmath19 ( ref .  ) , @xmath83 0.80@xmath8410@xmath85 mj @xmath86 ( ref .  ) , and @xmath81(300k ) @xmath18 50@xmath8410@xmath87 k@xmath19 ( ref .  ) to obtain a room temperature value @xmath29(300k ) @xmath18 12 mj mol@xmath19 k@xmath20 for each sample . to a very good approximation@xcite @xmath88 and

the upper inset in fig .
[ gphfig ] compares the phonon density of states extracted from @xmath90 with the spectrum for bafe@xmath3as@xmath3 obtained from inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) measurements by mittal _
et al_.@xcite ( we are unaware of ins data for any other k - doped samples ) .
our histogram reproduces the band width and the initial slope of the spectrum , though the neutron data places more weight at high frequencies .
this is not unexpected as inelastic neutron scattering measures a ( generalised ) phonon spectrum weighted by the scattering cross - sections and inverse masses of the different ions@xcite , whilst the phonon specific heat gives equal weight to all phonon modes .
the heavy ba ions contribute almost entirely to the low frequency phonon spectrum below 20mev , but carry a low weighting in the neutron spectrum .
this may account for the relatively greater weight in the phonon spectrum below 20mev and smaller weight at higher frequencies revealed by our measurements . in view of this , the agreement is quite reasonable and helps validate our main assumption that @xmath91 is approximately @xmath5-independent .

this data together with meissner effect measurements confirm that superconductivity is observed for @xmath96 , and that the @xmath4 = 0 and 0.1 samples are non - superconducting at all temperatures . in fig .
[ entropyfig ] we show @xmath97 in zero field for all samples , where the electronic entropy @xmath98 .
@xmath99 is the average value of @xmath60 in the temperature range 0 to @xmath5 , and equals @xmath100 at @xmath5 = 0 .
apart from @xmath4 = 0.9 and 1 , the underlying normal state electronic term @xmath73 below @xmath66 for the superconducting samples could not be determined directly by suppressing superconductivity with a magnetic field since their upper critical fields exceed 13 t .
however we can estimate the @xmath5-dependence of @xmath73 below @xmath66 with reasonable confidence using the following constraints .
( i ) @xmath73 and @xmath101 are continuous with no change of slope through @xmath66 , ( ii ) the normal state and superconducting entropies are equal at @xmath66 , @xmath102 ( i.e. the areas under @xmath73 and @xmath103 below @xmath66 ) are equal . for convenience we first choose a suitable @xmath5-dependence for @xmath104 and then obtain @xmath73 from @xmath105 .
the possible @xmath5-dependence for @xmath104 ( and hence @xmath73 ) is further restricted by the reasonable assumption for a fermi liquid that @xmath106 ( and @xmath107 ) close to @xmath5 = 0 .

@xmath110 increases systematically with doping , apart from the @xmath4 = 0.9 data which lies above the @xmath4 = 1.0 data .
this is probably due to the presence of a larger curie - weiss term in the @xmath4 = 0.9 sample . in their model ,
et al_. predict a small upturn at low-@xmath5 due to the presence of itinerant electrons coexisting with local , magnetically ordered moments@xcite .
however the unsystematic variation in the size of this upturn , both in our data and in the literature@xcite , suggests that it is predominantly extrinsic in nature . above the sdw transition at @xmath111 ,
@xmath109 increases linearly with @xmath5 for @xmath4 = 0 to 0.2 , which has been attributed to antiferromagnetic correlations persisting above @xmath111@xcite . for @xmath112
, @xmath109 exhibits a broad peak between 100k and 200k and smoothly crosses over at higher temperatures to a decreasing curie - like @xmath5-dependence .
this is precisely the behaviour predicted by the quantum heisenberg antiferromagnetic model@xcite . in a local moment model the steadily decreasing crossover temperature in our data implies that the ratio of the next - nearest to nearest neighbour magnetic super - exchange energies , @xmath113 , decreases with @xmath4 . on the other hand comparison of figs .
[ entropyfig ] and [ chifig ] shows that @xmath97 and @xmath109 have broadly similar @xmath5-dependences .
this behaviour is typical of a fermi liquid in which both properties are dominated by thermal excitation of quasi - particles .

the wilson ratio @xmath114 is plotted in fig .  [ wilsonfig ] .
note that we have not corrected @xmath109 for @xmath5-independent core and van vleck terms which are unlikely to exceed @xmath115 emu / mol .
if the @xmath116-factor is 2 , @xmath117 = 1 for non - interacting quasiparticles , 2 for spin-@xmath118 kondo alloys and many heavy fermion compounds and using this definition of the wilson ratio , 4.7 for non - interacting spin-@xmath118 moments .
@xmath117 is expected to decrease with electron - phonon enhancement of @xmath60 and to increase with exchange enhancement of @xmath110 . for the entire doping range @xmath119 ,
@xmath117 increases weakly with increasing temperature in the paramagnetic tetragonal phase from @xmath180.9 to 1.9 as shown in fig .
[ wilsonfig ] inset .
these values are reasonable for a correlated fermi liquid . just above @xmath66 the superconducting samples with @xmath120 to 0.8 have @xmath117 = 1.2 to 1.3 . in the orthorhombic sdw phase below @xmath111 for @xmath4 = 0 to 0.2
, @xmath117 increases steeply with decreasing temperature since the entropy , determined solely by thermal excitations , falls more rapidly with increasing magnetic order than @xmath109 .
for @xmath121 the value @xmath122 emu / mole in fig .
[ chifig ] can be used to estimate the effective moment @xmath123 per fe atom in the sdw phase . using the standard mean field formulae @xmath124 $ ] and @xmath125 , where @xmath126 is avogadro s number
, we find @xmath127 for @xmath4 = 0 . the small step in @xmath117 at the magneto / structural transition @xmath111 can be explained if only @xmath128 of the entropy jump at @xmath111 is caused by the sdw transition and the rest arises from the structural transition which would not contribute to @xmath109 .
( this estimate uses the value @xmath117 = 1.6 found just above @xmath111 for @xmath4 = 0 . )    , where @xmath129 , for @xmath4 = 0 to 1.0 . ]
we begin our discussion with the normal - state electronic specific heat @xmath73 , which exhibits a remarkable evolution with doping that is unlike anything we have seen previously in the cuprate high - temperature superconductors@xcite .    in the @xmath4
= 0 sample there is a sharp and almost first order anomaly at the magneto - structural transition at @xmath111 = 136k , with a small second - order - like shoulder @xmath181k above this .
this value of @xmath111 agrees with published single crystal data@xcite . at low temperatures , @xmath130 mj
mol@xmath19 k@xmath20 is a factor ten lower than its value above @xmath111 , reflecting gapping , i.e. reconstruction , of the fermi surface , and then increases as @xmath18 @xmath131 mj mol@xmath19 k@xmath20 in the range 40 @xmath132 110k .
this @xmath5-dependence is caused by quasiparticle and magnon excitations in the sdw phase .
band splitting and signs of partial gapping of the fermi surface have been observed in the sdw state of bafe@xmath3as@xmath3 by angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy@xcite . at low temperatures , @xmath133 mj mol@xmath19 k@xmath20 for @xmath4 = 0.1 , while for @xmath4 = 0.2 , extrapolating from above the weak superconducting transition , @xmath134 = 22.3 mj mol@xmath19 k@xmath20 .
this progressive increase in @xmath100 with @xmath4 arises from the progressive reduction in the gap induced by sdw order and the larger number of free carriers at low @xmath5 . for @xmath4
= 0.1 and 0.2 the corresponding anomalies at @xmath111 = 131.6k and 107k are broader and considerably reduced in magnitude compared with @xmath4 = 0 , in agreement with the data of rotter _
et al_.@xcite the magnetic field dependences of these anomalies are extremely weak .
@xmath135fe - mbauer spectroscopy@xcite and neutron diffraction@xcite measurements show that the sdw phase is fully suppressed somewhere between @xmath4 = 0.2 and 0.3 , and we see no evidence for a magneto / structural transition in our @xmath4 = 0.3 sample .
the very weak anomaly at 67k in the differential data for this sample ( fig .
[ gammafig](b ) ) is probably due to an feas impurity phase@xcite . by comparing the height of this anomaly to that of pure feas@xcite we estimate a feas concentration of 4 mole % in this sample .
feas anomalies are absent in all of our other samples .

dotted lines show @xmath73 for values of @xmath4 where @xmath136 . ]
values of the normal state @xmath73 at several fixed temperatures are shown in fig .
[ gvsxfig ] .
as @xmath4 increases from 0 to 0.3 , the collapsing magneto - structural anomaly results in a gradual filling - in of the normal - state @xmath73 at low-@xmath5 , while above 200k @xmath73 is only weakly dependent on @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( see figs .  [
gammafig](b ) & [ gvsxfig ] ) .
however for @xmath137 we observe a systematic decrease in @xmath73 with @xmath4 and with @xmath5 at high-@xmath5 . at low @xmath5
there is a larger peak in @xmath138 that grows with @xmath4 and correlates with the growth in @xmath139 , see fig .
[ gammafig](b ) . at intermediate concentrations @xmath4
= 0.5 to 0.8 , this peak is masked by the superconducting transition , though its presence in the underlying normal state @xmath73 can be inferred from the entropy conserving determinations of @xmath73 and @xmath104 shown in figs .
[ ghvstfig ] and [ entropyfig ] .
the magnitude of the peak grows rapidly towards @xmath4 = 1 , with the peak temperature falling with @xmath4 to 15k at @xmath4 = 1 .
a similar enhancement at low-@xmath5 and high-@xmath4 has also been observed in the related sr@xmath1k@xmath2fe@xmath3as@xmath3 system via conventional heat capacity techniques@xcite .
although we can not entirely exclude the possibility that the low temperature peak in @xmath73 is a result of an error in the phonon correction , we believe that this is unlikely for the following reasons . as noted above , the observed negative peak in the raw data at 35k ,
increasing progressively with @xmath4 across the entire series , is consistent with the expected increase in phonon frequencies on substituting heavy ba with light k. to explain a positive peak , increasing non - linearly with @xmath4 at a temperature decreasing with @xmath4 , in terms of phonons would require a substantial @xmath5 and @xmath4-dependent softening of low frequency phonon modes .
we are unaware of any reason or evidence for such soft mode behaviour in heavily doped ba@xmath1k@xmath2fe@xmath3as@xmath3 , and we believe this low-@xmath5 positive peak is more likely to be a feature of the electronic spectrum .    also shown in fig .
[ gvsxfig ] are band structure ( bs ) values@xcite for @xmath73 for @xmath4 = 0 , 0.5 and 1 .
comparison with the experimental values show an electronic mass enhancement @xmath140 of around 4 for @xmath4 = 0 ( @xmath141 ) increasing to around 9 at 40k for @xmath4 = 1 .
this evolution is inconsistent with a simple shift of the fermi level ( @xmath142 ) towards a van - hove singularity in the density of states ( dos ) as proposed for example in overdoped cuprates@xcite .
this would give an increasing @xmath73 with @xmath4 at all @xmath5 and a significant shift in the peak temperature of the low-@xmath5 hump in @xmath138 with @xmath4 .
instead , the @xmath4-dependence at high and low-@xmath5 is suggestive of a transfer of spectral weight from high to low energies .
this can been seen explicitly in a set of model effective dos curves shown in fig .
[ dosfig ] that reproduces the @xmath7 data over the entire temperature range . in these calculations
the chemical potential was adjusted in order to maintain the same number of quasiparticles at all @xmath5 .
the development of the low-@xmath5 hump between 15 and 20k requires a very sharp spike in the dos located about 5mev from @xmath142 , that grows in magnitude with @xmath4 at the expense of states on either side of it .
it is possible that this kind of structure arises from strong electron - electron correlations of the type that occur in heavy fermion compounds
. the evolution of @xmath7 for @xmath137 can probably be explained in terms of a temperature dependent mass enhancement that increases with @xmath4 , and indeed the @xmath5-dependence of @xmath73 resembles the renormalization expected from coupling of the electrons to phonons@xcite , or to paramagnons@xcite . the substantial reduction in the wilson ratio for @xmath4
= 1 shown in fig .
[ wilsonfig](inset ) could be evidence in favour of electron - phonon enhancement .
although electron - phonon interactions are thought to be relatively weak in these materials@xcite , we should remember that any electron interaction process that is strongly volume dependent will increase the electron - phonon coupling .
the peak in @xmath73 at 15k for @xmath4 = 1 is reduced by less than 0.15@xmath143 in magnetic fields up to 13 t ( for which the zeeman energy @xmath144 = 9k ) .
this could be a problem for theories involving spin fluctuations and might point towards more general correlations of the fe 3d electrons as mentioned in ref .  .     from 0k to 380k
the dos at the fermi level determined from @xmath73 extrapolated to @xmath5 = 0 is compared with values from band structure calculations@xcite in the upper left inset .
]      several important properties of the superconducting condensate can be determined directly from the specific heat data shown in figs .
[ ghvstfig ] and [ entropyfig ] .
the superconducting condensation energy @xmath145 is the free energy difference at @xmath5 = 0 between normal and superconducting states in zero field , and is given by @xmath146 .

yields the magnetisation @xmath148 in the mixed state and from that the superfluid density and critical fields
. this will be the subject of a further publication .
finally , the field dependence of @xmath149 in the mixed state at low-@xmath5 can be used to determine the pairing symmetry . in the clean limit
a single @xmath150-wave gap gives rise to a linear @xmath6-dependence@xcite , while a @xmath151-wave gap results in a @xmath152-dependence@xcite .
@xmath153 at 5k is shown in fig .
[ dgh5kfig ] for @xmath4 = 0.2 to 0.8 .
the data is well described by a slightly sub - linear @xmath154 power law with @xmath155 ranging from 0.75 to 1.0 ( see the inset to fig .
[ dgh5kfig ] ) .
sublinear behaviour has been interpreted terms of a multiband @xmath156-wave state , comprising either two unequally sized isotropic @xmath150-wave gaps in the presence of impurity scattering , as proposed by bang@xcite , or an isotropic gap in combination with an anisotropic gap , as proposed by wang@xcite .
we see from the inset to fig .
[ dgh5kfig ] that @xmath157 is much smaller for @xmath4 = 0.3 to 0.5 where @xmath158 .
it is quite possible that all samples would show sub - linear @xmath6-dependence in the low-@xmath5 limit . a detailed analysis taking into account the three bands described below and their @xmath5 dependence would be needed to obtain meaningful values of @xmath155 .    .

the structure between 25 and 35k is due to intergrain coupling . ]    like @xmath73 , the superconducting - state @xmath16 displays a rich progression with doping .
this can be clearly seen from the magnetic field dependence @xmath149 for @xmath4 = 0.2 to 1 shown in fig .
[ ghvstfig ] and from the change with field @xmath160 shown in fig .
[ dghtfig ] .
note that the phonon contribution to the raw data is independent of field and does not contribute to @xmath161 .
in contrast to a previous study@xcite we observe superconducting anomalies in all samples from @xmath4 = 0.2 to 1.0 . for most of the superconducting compositions we can identify three distinct features in plots of @xmath149 ( fig .  [ ghvstfig ] ) and @xmath161 in fig .
[ dghtfig ] which appear to correspond to different sc gaps in three bands .
the temperatures associated with these features are shown in fig .
[ tkpsfig ] .
the most obvious feature is a relatively sharp mean - field - like peak at @xmath162 reflecting the collapse of a gap with @xmath5 = 0 magnitude @xmath163 , where @xmath159 is taken to be the temperature of maximum negative slope of @xmath60 ( slightly above the peak temperature @xmath162 ) .
this feature appears as a sharp negative peak at @xmath162 in @xmath161 in fig .
[ dghtfig ] . at lower temperature
there is a broad schottky - like anomaly ( the `` knee '' ) peaking at @xmath164 . the progressive suppression of the knee in the vicinity of @xmath164 with increasing magnetic field , clearly seen in fig .  [ dghtfig ] , and the rapid increase in @xmath149 at lower temperatures seen in fig .
[ ghvstfig ] confirm that the `` knee '' is of superconducting origin and is not an artifact of errors in our phonon correction .
since the peak is broad , the underlying sc gap must be essentially @xmath5-independent in the region @xmath165 , with approximate magnitude @xmath166 .
the onset temperature of the knee gap is uncertain but is at least as high as @xmath162 since no further anomaly is seen between @xmath164 and @xmath162 .
the highest temperature feature clearly visible in the zero field data in fig .
[ ghvstfig ] for @xmath4 = 0.5 , 0.6 and 0.7 , and in the onset of an @xmath6-dependent suppression for @xmath4 = 0.8 and 0.9 , is a broad shoulder extending above @xmath162 with an abrupt onset signifying a phase transition at @xmath12 .
@xmath12 is close to @xmath167k for @xmath4 = 0.5 to 0.7 and @xmath168 21k for @xmath4 = 0.8 and 11k for @xmath4 = 0.9 .
we note that @xmath12 also coincides with the onset of diamagnetism ( see fig .
[ zfcfig ] ) and is the true superconducting transition temperature .
examination of fig .
[ ghvstfig ] shows that field dependent shifts are comparable in magnitude for both the main peak and shoulder for @xmath4 = 0.5 to 0.8 .
this implies that values for the upper critical field will also be comparable for both features .
finally as shown in fig .
[ ghvstfig ] , for dopings , @xmath4 = 0.3 to 0.6 where the `` knee '' gap is large enough to estimate the initial @xmath5-dependence of @xmath60 , we find a small but finite @xmath169 . even in samples where @xmath16 is relatively large at our lowest temperature
a small value of @xmath170 can be inferred from plots of @xmath97 in fig .
[ entropyfig ] .
a small residual @xmath100 has been found for @xmath4 = 1 in measurements down to 0.1k@xcite confirming our conclusions from @xmath97 ( fig .
[ entropyfig ] ) .
these values of @xmath100 are summarised later in fig .
[ alphafig](c ) .
the conclusion that @xmath100 is small for all @xmath4 is important since it confirms the existence of a low temperature knee in @xmath60 for all of the higher values of @xmath4 , and also demonstrates that the small magnitude of the anomalies at @xmath162 for high @xmath4 is not due to non - superconducting regions in the sample or to strong pair breaking .
the small residual @xmath100 may result from pair breaking in one or more of the gaps , a low level of impurities , or an additional non - superconducting band with a very small dos .
for @xmath4 = 0.2 the strong suppression of the superconducting transition in the magnetically ordered phase makes identification of the three features discussed above far less clear . the structure in @xmath161 in fig .
[ dghtfig](a ) reveals that the rather featureless broad superconducting anomaly shown in fig .
[ ghvstfig](a ) is in fact composed of two peaks at 11k and 23k , which may perhaps be attributed to the main - peak and shoulder bands respectively .
the weak negative curvature in zero field and rapid increase with @xmath6 below the crossing point at 7k may suggest a small superconducting gap possibly associated with the `` knee '' band .    , @xmath159 and @xmath12 associated with the knee , peak and shoulder features respectively . ]      as shown in figs .
[ ghvstfig ] , [ dghtfig ] and  [ tkpsfig ] the peak temperature @xmath164 of the broad `` knee '' feature decreases with @xmath4 from around 17k for @xmath4 = 0.3 to 3k for @xmath4 = 0.7 and in fact is still present at @xmath18 0.7k@xcite for @xmath4 = 1 .
however , the amplitude of the knee grows with @xmath4 due to the increasing dominance of the normal state dos for this band ( sec .
[ secbandstruc ] ) , and at low-@xmath5 and high-@xmath4 this feature makes the largest contribution to @xmath60 .
transition temperatures for ba@xmath1k@xmath2fe@xmath3as@xmath3 quoted in the literature@xcite correspond most closely to the transition temperatures @xmath159 of the mean - field - like peaks shown in fig .
[ tkpsfig ] . for @xmath171
, @xmath172 is approximately parabolic with a maximum value @xmath173 = 38.5k at @xmath174 = 0.39 .
however , evidence presented below suggests that for @xmath4 = 0.4 the main peak and shoulder anomalies may almost coincide , and that @xmath159 and therefore also @xmath173 may be @xmath18 1k lower than the values quoted above . at higher @xmath4 , @xmath159 decreases more slowly and for @xmath4 = 1 we find @xmath159 = 3.2k . with the disappearance of the magneto / structural transition just below @xmath4
= 0.3 , the anomaly height @xmath175 at @xmath162 increases rapidly to a maximum at @xmath4 = 0.4 , as shown in fig .
[ dgfig ] .
for @xmath4 = 0.4 and 0.5 the anomaly heights are comparable with or larger than published single crystal data@xcite .
the decrease in @xmath175 by @xmath176 in @xmath4 = 0.5 and a further factor of two for @xmath4 = 0.6 coincides with the growth of the `` shoulder '' above @xmath162 .
@xmath175 is relatively constant between @xmath4 = 0.6 and 0.9 where we see evidence for a `` shoulder '' , but increases for @xmath4 = 1 where no evidence for a `` shoulder '' is observed ( fig .
[ dgfig ] ) . since the residual @xmath100 is small and @xmath73 increases continuously across the series ( fig .
[ dgfig ] ) , an increase in @xmath175 for @xmath112 would be expected on a single band scenario . in a multi - band situation
however , @xmath175 would be roughly constant if the contributions to @xmath73 from the bands with larger gaps are approximately doping independent , as suggested by explicit fits to the data in section [ secbandstruc ] ( fig .
[ alphafig ] ) .
so the very sharp fall in @xmath175 is unexpected , and seems to result more from the growth of the shoulder .    the field dependence of the main peaks shown in figs .
[ ghvstfig ] and [ dghtfig ] provide clear evidence for short coherence lengths and low dimensionality .
firstly the peaks broaden and reduce in height with an almost @xmath6-independent onset .
this behaviour is typical of short coherence length superconductors such as the high-@xmath66 cuprates and is in sharp contrast to the progressive shift to lower temperature without change in shape observed in classical superconductors@xcite .
secondly for @xmath4 = 0.2 to @xmath177 there is a well defined crossing point in @xmath149 5 to 10k below @xmath162 over a wide range of fields which is also observed in the highly anisotropic cuprate bi@xmath3sr@xmath3cacu@xmath3o@xmath178@xcite . in zero field ,
superconducting fluctuations invariably extend well above the temperature at which an @xmath6-dependence is first observed , and can in the present system be easily distinguished from the shoulder by their positive curvature and absence of an onset temperature .
zero - field fluctuations above @xmath159 can be seen in the data for @xmath149 in fig .
[ ghvstfig ] and in @xmath179 shown in fig .
[ dgdtfig ] , and in all cases appear to diverge towards @xmath159 and never towards @xmath12
. this term can be well fitted both near @xmath159 and above @xmath12 by an expression for 3d-2d gaussian fluctuations@xcite , @xmath180 where @xmath181 , @xmath182 and @xmath183 is the 3d-2d crossover temperature .
@xmath117 is the universal gas constant , @xmath184 and @xmath185 are the lattice parameters from fig .
[ latticefig ] , and @xmath186 and @xmath187 are the @xmath188-plane and @xmath185-axis superconducting coherence lengths at @xmath5 = 0 .
values for all the parameters for @xmath6 = 0 are shown in table .
[ fluctable ] . for most of the samples
, good fits to the 3d-2d gaussian fluctuation expression were obtained taking @xmath189 , the main peak transition temperature .
deviations from the fit are only visible close to @xmath159 , as demonstrated by the abrupt downturns in the corrected curves in figs .
[ gsnfig](a ) and [ gsnfig](b ) .
however for @xmath4 = 0.4 where no shoulder is observed , there is an abrupt change of the fluctuation @xmath5-dependence close to 38k which is similar to that seen in samples with a shoulder . because of this abrupt change a good fit to the gaussian fluctuation expression above 38k
could only be obtained if @xmath190 was taken to be @xmath18 1k lower than @xmath159 .
this may be indirect evidence that the main peak and shoulder anomalies are almost coincident for this sample and the true @xmath159 for @xmath4 = 0.4 is @xmath18 1k lower than the value 37.55k quoted in table  [ fluctable ] .
values of @xmath191 are reasonably reliable but values of @xmath192 are not very reliable for samples with a shoulder . for @xmath4 = 0.3
, @xmath192 is very sensitive to the value taken for @xmath190 which is difficult to estimate since the main peak and shoulder are difficult to distinguish .
values for the coherence length @xmath193  that we find from the fluctuation term in bkfa are comparable with those found in the cuprates and are consistent with the large values of upper critical field @xmath194 that can be inferred from plots of @xmath149 in fig .
[ ghvstfig ] .
[ cols='<,<,<,^,<,<,<,<,^ , < ' , ]      = 0.4 to 0.8 . ]
a further puzzling feature is the absence of a significant fluctuation term diverging at or near the onset of the shoulder at @xmath12 . integrating eq .
[ eq : fluc ] for @xmath195 over the distribution @xmath196 expected for inhomogeneity extending through @xmath174 gives a fluctuation term @xmath197 that diverges at @xmath12 .
if @xmath198 is comparable with the values found for the main peak , this term would be very much larger than that observed , and its absence is further evidence against an explanation for the shoulder in terms of spatial inhomogeneity .
an explanation for the shoulder in terms of doping inhomogeneity therefore faces severe challenges .
i ) how can a very sharp main peak at @xmath162 with small @xmath199 0.006 ( table  [ spreadtable ] ) coexist with a shoulder with a much larger spread @xmath200 0.2 to 0.6 , where @xmath201 is the nominal concentration ?
( see appendix ) .
ii ) the large weight @xmath202 in the shoulder with a substantial probability @xmath203 at @xmath174 should be clearly visible in x - ray spectra .
in fact the x - ray spectra shown in fig .
[ latticefig ] are relatively sharp with an @xmath4-independent half width and no evidence for a shoulder towards or beyond @xmath174 .
iii ) if there is doping inhomogeneity we would expect this to be symmetrical about the nominal doping @xmath201 and the average to be close to @xmath201 , contrary to the conclusions in the appendix .
iv ) this interpretation can not explain the divergence of the amplitude @xmath204 of the shoulder as @xmath205 decreases , or the almost complete absence of fluctuations diverging at @xmath12 .
for all these reasons we believe the samples are spatially homogeneous with an root - mean - square ( rms ) width @xmath180.006 given by that of the main peak at @xmath162 .
this is in fact an upper limit as the width will also contain a contribution from instrumental broadening of the transition .
we conclude that it is extremely unlikely that the shoulder is due to local doping inhomogeneity .
* c ) * intrinsic electronic inhomogeneity . even without chemical inhomogeneity ,
local electronic inhomogeneity may give rise to a distribution of gaps with onset temperatures from @xmath159 to @xmath12 .
such a situation might arise due to local variations in the fe - as - fe bond angle , the value of which can have a strong influence on the presence or absence of certain sheets of the fermi surface@xcite .
frustration in the sign of the superconducting gaps in a 3-band @xmath156 scenario may also lead to a local spread of gap magnitudes .
any band or gap unaffected by these effects would contribute to the sharp anomaly .
these local effects on bands and superconducting gaps would not affect the x - ray spectra and therefore this interpretation would not be subject to many of the objections raised above against chemical inhomogeneity .
however , as seen above , the anomalous @xmath206 dependence of @xmath60 in the shoulder region requires a probability distribution @xmath207 that diverges at @xmath173 .
this is expected for chemical inhomogeneity extending through @xmath174 with a parabolic @xmath208 , but would be harder to explain for intrinsic electronic inhomogeneity .    * d ) * our last hypothesis is that the shoulder results from a third band with a superconducting gap @xmath209 with an unconventional @xmath5-dependence near @xmath12 .
evidence for three gaps has been observed in electron - doped bafe@xmath210co@xmath211as@xmath3@xcite and multiple bands are found to cross the fermi level in bkfa@xcite , so the prospect of multiple gaps is not unreasonable .
the complex transitions seen here in bkfa appear to suggest a minimum of three bands and three superconducting gaps .
theories of two coupled gaps@xcite invariably predict a sharp peak in @xmath60 at the initial onset temperature @xmath66 , and a broad schottky like anomaly at lower temperatures .
this agrees with the behaviour seen in the well established two gap material mgb@xmath3@xcite , and accounts for the `` knee '' and `` main peak '' features in our data .
two - gap theories can not however explain the additional `` shoulder '' feature in bkfa and most importantly , the absence of a jump in @xmath60 at the onset of long range order at @xmath12 .
the @xmath5-dependence of the gap close to @xmath12 can be determined from the @xmath212 @xmath5-dependence in the shoulder region . if the quasi - particle energies have the bcs dependence @xmath213 it is easily shown that close to the transition when @xmath214 , the entropy @xmath215 is given by @xmath216 for @xmath214 , where @xmath217 is the renormalised normal state dos / spin at @xmath142 and @xmath218 .
if , as in a usual mean field transition , @xmath219 has a step @xmath220 at @xmath66 then @xmath221 just below @xmath66 and eq .
[ eq : ts ] gives the expected mean - field dependence @xmath222 . if there is no step at @xmath66 but instead @xmath223 as we observe for the shoulder , then @xmath224 and from eq .
[ eq : ts ] , @xmath225 .
we are unaware of any theoretical treatment that predicts this limiting @xmath5-dependence .
note that for a @xmath226-dependent gap or for multiple gaps ( @xmath227 ) , @xmath228 in the above expressions should be replaced by a fermi surface average @xmath229 and @xmath230 .
ferrell@xcite has derived the following exact expression for @xmath228 for a weak - coupling @xmath150-wave superconductor in terms of the superconducting free energy @xmath231 and entropy @xmath232 which is valid over the entire range @xmath233 @xmath234 where @xmath235 .
this result is also valid for an anisotropic gap if @xmath228 is replaced by a fermi surface average @xmath236 , and we will assume that it is approximately correct for coupled multiple bands .
this gives the standard bcs expression at @xmath5 = 0 , @xmath237 , where @xmath238 is the sc condensation energy , and also the expression @xmath239 near @xmath66 where @xmath240 .
we will therefore assume that for coupled gaps eq .
[ eq : l6 ] gives a good approximation for @xmath236 over the entire temperature range , and that the temperature derivative of eq .
[ eq : l6 ] @xmath241 gives a good approximation to the slope @xmath242 , ( ignoring the @xmath5-dependence of @xmath73 ) .
we note that for strong coupling , @xmath243 in eqs .
[ eq : ts]-[eq : l7 ] is smaller than its normal state value because of the effect of the superconducting gap on the renormalisation@xcite .
thus for strong coupling superconductors using eqs .
[ eq : ts]-[eq : l7 ] with the normal state value for @xmath243 underestimates the true values for @xmath244 and @xmath242 .
for example , for the strong coupling superconductor pb , @xmath245 deduced from @xmath145 is @xmath246 lower than the gap @xmath245 found from tunnelling experiments@xcite .
plots of @xmath247 vs @xmath5 , @xmath244 vs @xmath5 , @xmath242 vs @xmath5 obtained via eq .
[ eq : l7 ] , and @xmath248 vs @xmath249 are shown in figs .
[ drmsfig](a)@xmath132(d ) respectively .
the first three plots show a rather abrupt crossover from a more or less conventional @xmath5-dependence below @xmath162 to an unconventional `` shoulder '' @xmath5-dependence above @xmath162 , the crossover occurring when @xmath247 falls below @xmath250mev .
the persistence of a finite gap above the shoulder onset @xmath12 , most clearly seen in fig .
[ drmsfig](a ) , is due to superconducting fluctuations diverging at @xmath159 .
these plots show several interesting and unusual features . below @xmath162
the slopes @xmath242 obtained from fig .
[ drmsfig](c ) are almost independent of doping , and give no advance warning of the strongly doping dependent peak heights and shoulders at and above @xmath162 .
[ drmsfig](d ) shows a striking linear relation between @xmath248 and @xmath251 at all temperatures up to @xmath162 , in contrast to the expected negative curvature .
this crosses over abruptly at @xmath159 to a gentle decrease to zero at @xmath12 . in the linear region below @xmath162 @xmath252
where @xmath253 = 1.06 and 1.03 for @xmath4 = 0.5 and 0.6 , and the intercept @xmath254 increases approximately linearly with @xmath4 for @xmath255 and more slowly at higher @xmath4
. an unexpected consequence of eq .
[ eq : jl7 ] is that for @xmath112 the main peak transition temperatures @xmath159 can be predicted simply from a @xmath5-independent downward shift of @xmath251 by @xmath254 .
note that these simple parallel shifts with @xmath4 are not seen in the curves for @xmath256 .
interestingly we find that @xmath242 is also independent of @xmath6 below @xmath257 leading to similar parallel downward shifts in @xmath244 with @xmath6 for @xmath4 = 0.4 , 0.5 and 0.6 .

the slope of @xmath244 below @xmath162 is approximately independent of doping .
( d ) @xmath259 vs @xmath260 where temperature is an implicit parameter . ,
width=264 ]    we have seen that fluctuations always appear to diverge towards @xmath159 , and conclude that at this temperature the magnitudes of the main peak and knee gaps are close to zero .
assuming that all three gaps are coupled at lower temperatures , coupling to the shoulder gap must therefore weaken as @xmath5 approaches @xmath159 leading to a change in the shoulder gap @xmath5-dependence .
however , the fact that the amplitude @xmath204 of the anomalous @xmath261 dependence in @xmath60 from the shoulder increases as @xmath4 goes from 0.7 to 0.5 and @xmath12 becomes closer to @xmath159 ( fig .
[ gsnfig ] ) clearly shows that the main peak and shoulder gaps are not independent above @xmath159 , even though the magnitude of the main peak gap is small .
it is possible that residual coupling to fluctuations in the main peak order parameter may be responsible for the anomalous @xmath262 temperature dependence in the shoulder region .
the @xmath5-dependence of @xmath244 found above gives @xmath263 .
if , as observed , coupling to the shoulder gap changes abruptly at a roughly constant value for @xmath264 , this result provides a simple explanation for the divergence of @xmath204 as @xmath205 decreases .
guided by the evidence for three distinct gaps in figs .
[ ghvstfig ] and [ dghtfig ] we have extended the widely - used@xcite two - band @xmath15-model@xcite to estimate the @xmath5 = 0 gaps and dos for the three bands . in the alpha - model the ratio @xmath265 of each gap is an adjustable parameter , and @xmath266 where @xmath267 is the normalized bcs gap at @xmath268@xcite . for the knee and main peak bands
we employ the bcs @xmath5-dependence @xmath267 , taking the onset temperature of the knee gap to be the same as that of the main peak gap .
we integrate both bands over identical gaussian distributions of onset temperatures , with standard deviation @xmath269k , to simulate the rounding of the main peak . assuming that a distinct band is responsible for the shoulder , we model its @xmath5-dependence as follows .
as discussed above , the @xmath270 @xmath5-dependence of the shoulder implies that near @xmath271 , @xmath272 . to incorporate this detail into the @xmath5-dependence of the shoulder band gap we replace @xmath268 in the bcs gap function @xmath267 by @xmath273 @xmath274 is a crossover temperature such that for @xmath275 , @xmath276 while for @xmath277 , @xmath278 .
three - gap fits are shown in fig .
[ gfitsfig ] for @xmath279 .
for @xmath280 the fits were made by following the doping dependence of the fit parameters down from higher @xmath4 , with the shape of the knee and main peak below @xmath162 providing good constraints on the range of possible values .
for @xmath4 = 0.9 and 1.0 , where no clear evidence for a shoulder is seen and the knee is below our base temperature , a two - gap fit has been applied .
although @xmath60 for these two samples is still large at 2k , our plots of @xmath97 in fig .
[ entropyfig ] and published data for @xmath60 below 2k for @xmath4
= 1@xcite show that @xmath134 is small in each case .
we note that there is considerable evidence for nodes on the fermi surface of kfe@xmath3as@xmath3@xcite , but because the knee gap is small this effect does not alter our results significantly .
overall , the quality of the fits using this model is excellent .
the region immediately above the main peak is not quite reproduced since we have not included the fluctuation component diverging towards @xmath162 from above in the fits .
figure  [ dvsxfig](a ) shows the systematic doping dependence of the sc gap magnitudes for each band extracted from the fits .
all three gaps show a roughly parabolic doping dependence between @xmath4 = 0.2 and 0.6 with a maximum near @xmath4 = 0.4 , before tailing off more gradually at higher doping .
the @xmath5-dependence of the three gaps for @xmath4 = 0.5 is shown in fig .  [ dvsxfig](b ) , which displays behaviour typical of the dopings where a shoulder anomaly is present .
the knee and main peak gaps can be understood in terms of the two - coupled - gap model proposed by suhl _
et al_.@xcite and kogan _ _ et al.__@xcite . when the interband coupling in this model is sufficiently large , both gaps approach @xmath66 smoothly , as is the case for @xmath281 and @xmath282 leading to the broad specific heat anomaly at @xmath164 and the sharp peak at @xmath162 discussed above .
as discussed in the previous section , the shoulder gap has an unconventional @xmath5-dependence near @xmath12 .
it remains to be seen if a three - band coupled - gap model can give rise to such an effect .
sign changes in the gaps and frustration effects may play a key role , and we would welcome input from theorists on this matter .
dias and marques@xcite have already demonstrated some of the unusual @xmath5-dependences that can arise from a frustrated multiband model .
a further curious result of our analysis is that the shoulder gap @xmath283 appears to be smaller than the main peak gap @xmath284 , even though @xmath285 ( see fig 21(b ) ) .
interestingly it has been demonstrated that such behaviour can arise from the self - consistent bcs gap equation for @xmath286@xcite or @xmath287@xcite symmetries .
moreover an intermediate @xmath288 symmetry has been proposed in ba@xmath1k@xmath2fe@xmath3as@xmath3 for @xmath4 between 0.4 and 1.0@xcite .
we therefore propose that this feature may signify the presence of mixed or unusual competing order parameters .    .

the dotted line shows the initial @xmath289 dependence of the shoulder gap . ]
in addition to the sc gap magnitudes , the three - band fits reveal the doping dependence of the fractions of the dos contributed by each band @xmath290 , @xmath291 and @xmath292 and their relative contributions @xmath293 to the normal state electronic term @xmath294 .
these quantities are shown in fig .
[ alphafig ] . above @xmath4 = 0.2 ,
the `` knee '' contribution @xmath295 increases steadily , characteristic of a hole - like band and this band contributes more than 60@xmath143 of the dos at high doping .
although we are unable to resolve a third gap for @xmath4 = 0.9 and 1 it is possible that there are three gaps across the entire doping range .
if this is the case and if the shoulder and main peak bands contribute roughly equally for @xmath4 = 0.9 and 1 , we obtain the dashed lines shown in fig .
[ alphafig ] .
values of @xmath293 for the main peak and shoulder bands are almost identical and relatively doping independent up to at least @xmath4 = 0.8 , though their contribution to the total dos decreases with @xmath4 .
it is important to assess the reliability of the parameters deduced from the fits shown in figs .
[ dvsxfig ] and [ alphafig ] . for the `` knee '' band
, the value of the gap @xmath296 and the normal state dos fraction @xmath290 can be determined with confidence from the temperature and magnitude of the knee in @xmath60 .
the values of @xmath284 and @xmath283 for the main peak and shoulder anomalies depend on the assumption that distinct bands are responsible for the peak and shoulder features in @xmath60 . on that assumption , fitting the strong positive curvature in @xmath60 below the peak with the @xmath15-model leads to the large ( strong coupling ) values for the gap @xmath284 and for @xmath297 shown in figs .
[ dvsxfig ] and [ alphafig](a ) .
it should be noted however that @xmath15-model fits focusing primarily on the peak region may overestimate @xmath245 and @xmath15 for strong coupling@xcite .
this overestimate would have little effect on the fit to @xmath60 at lower temperatures ( fig .
[ gfitsfig ] ) since @xmath60 is small and insensitive to @xmath298 when @xmath299 .
the reliability of the shoulder gap @xmath283 depends somewhat on the validity of the interpolation from the bcs to shoulder @xmath5-dependences for @xmath300 discussed above , and is therefore difficult to assess .
we are confident however that the values of the dos fractions @xmath301 and the contributions to the normal state @xmath294 for all three bands are reliable .    .

studies of the fermi surface ( fs ) of ba@xmath1k@xmath2fe@xmath3as@xmath3 by shubnikov - de haas oscillations and angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy have yielded the following observations . in the sdw phase the fermi surface consists of small pockets of hole- and electron - like character@xcite . these are believed to arise from band folding combined with finite @xmath304 corrugation . in the tetragonal phase the fs
is composed of three concentric hole sheets at the @xmath305 point@xcite ( also seen in electron - doped ba(fe@xmath1co@xmath2)@xmath3as@xmath3@xcite ) , and a propeller - like structure at the @xmath306 point made up of hole - like blades surrounding an electron - like center@xcite . with increasing @xmath4 the hole - like surfaces
expand , and the electron - like surface shrinks before disappearing near @xmath4 = 1.0@xcite .
a small superconducting gap is observed on the outer @xmath305 pocket , while larger gaps are detected on the inner @xmath305 pocket(s ) and @xmath306 pockets@xcite . with these observations in mind
it is possible to assign our bands to particular fs sheets .
the knee band has a small gap and increases with doping , behaviour consistent with the outer @xmath305 hole pocket .
note that this quasi-2d sheet has a large value of @xmath307 @xcite .
the shoulder band has a larger gap , and if this band vanishes above @xmath4 = 0.8 it would be consistent with the electron pocket at the @xmath306 point .
the main peak band has the largest gap consistent with inner @xmath305 hole pockets .
the increase in @xmath291 above @xmath4 = 0.8 , shown in fig .
[ alphafig ] , suggests that this band also includes contributions from the hole - like blades at the @xmath306 point .
however , it is also possible that for @xmath4 = 0.9 and 1.0 both the main peak and shoulder bands continue to make an approximately equal contribution to @xmath73 ( dashed lines in fig .
[ alphafig ] ) . at @xmath4
= 0.4 , @xmath66 , @xmath308 and the superconducting condensation energy are maximal ( figs .
[ u0fig ] and [ drmsfig](a ) ) . at this particular
doping we note that the three bands contribute equal fractions to the dos . if @xmath309 is similar for each band , this would imply that the hole and electron pockets are roughly the same size , and support the hypothesis that @xmath66 in this system is governed by the degree of fermi surface nesting@xcite .    in fig .
[ fcfig ] we show a temperature - doping phase diagram comprised of the magneto - structural transition temperature @xmath111 and onset temperatures of the three sc gaps , overlaid on a false color plot of @xmath71 . for @xmath310 ,
the superconducting phase competes with , and ultimately succumbs to , a decrease in spectral weight due to increasing gapping in the sdw phase .
an analogous situation occurs in the pseudogap phase of the high-@xmath66 cuprates@xcite . at higher dopings , @xmath112 ,
the superconducting transition temperatures and condensation energies fall in the presence of an increasing normal - state @xmath16 .
interestingly , in overdoped cuprates where @xmath66 is less than optimal , @xmath16 is also large@xcite .
the observed fall in @xmath66 despite the presence of a growing dos indicates that the dos might not be the dominant factor governing @xmath66 .
it is possible in the case of bkfa that the fall in @xmath66 with @xmath4 is driven by increasingly poor fs nesting as the hole pockets expand and the electron pocket shrinks .    ,
and onset temperatures of the sc gaps of each band , overlaid on a false - color plot of the electronic specific heat .
k _ , _ p _ and _ s _ correspond to the knee , main peak and shoulder features respectively . ]
in summary , using a high - resolution differential technique we have determined the electronic specific heat @xmath16 of ba@xmath1k@xmath2fe@xmath3as@xmath3 with @xmath4 = 0 to 1.0 , from 2k to 380k and in magnetic fields 0 to 13 t . in the sdw phase
the low - temperature normal - state values of @xmath73 are reduced relative to their values at high temperature by factors of 10 , 5 and 2 for @xmath4 = 0 , 0.1 and 0.2 respectively , reflecting partial gapping or reconstruction of the fermi surface .
near optimal doping @xmath73 is practically @xmath5-independent . as @xmath4 increases to 1.0 an increase in @xmath73 with @xmath4 at low-@xmath5
is accompanied by a corresponding decrease at high-@xmath5 , consistent with a substantial renormalisation of the effective mass as seen experimentally by de haas van alphen studies for @xmath4 = 1 @xcite .    in the superconducting state
we have observed a new feature .
in addition to the well - known knee and peak features that are typically associated with two distinct bands and sc gaps , we have identified a shoulder feature above the main peak with an abrupt onset temperature @xmath12 .
our attempts to explain this feature in terms of doping inhomogeneity fail to withstand rigorous analysis on several levels .
in particular , the extent of inhomogeneity implied by the breadth of the shoulder is inconsistent with x - ray diffraction spectra and is contradicted by the consistently sharp transitions of the main peak .
hence we conclude that the samples are spatially homogeneous and instead attribute the shoulder to a third band and sc gap
. the anomalous @xmath261 dependence of @xmath60 in the shoulder region and the absence of a mean field jump at @xmath12 await theoretical treatment .
an analysis of gaussian fluctuations above the main peak yield superconducting coherence lengths @xmath311 20  and @xmath312 3 .
it is possible that the separate onset temperatures of the shoulder and main - peak gaps signify the presence of mixed or unusual competing order parameters .
the doping dependence of the three gaps and bands was extracted via the application of a three - band @xmath15-model .
the sc gaps , @xmath66 and the condensation energy are all maximal at @xmath4 = 0.4 and the evolution of the bands is consistent with changes in the fermi surface observed by arpes . at this doping
the three bands contribute equal fractions to the density of states .
finally , the sub - linear magnetic field dependence of @xmath16 at low @xmath5 for @xmath4 = 0.3 to 0.5 points towards an unusual pairing symmetry such as @xmath156-wave .
this important point needs more detailed analysis , though ideally the field dependences should be determined at lower temperatures .

to explain the shoulder feature on this interpretation requires a broad spread of local doping with probability @xmath313 between @xmath314 and @xmath315 .
the corresponding spread of local @xmath66 s has a probability distribution @xmath316 between @xmath317 and @xmath318 . for a parabolic dependence @xmath319 $ ] peaking at @xmath174
, we have @xmath320 and @xmath321 . the contribution to the specific heat coefficient @xmath322 is given by @xmath323 where for simplicity we assume that the function @xmath324 representing the unbroadened mean - field transition has a discontinuous jump @xmath325 at @xmath66 and is zero for @xmath326 . since only those regions with local @xmath66 greater than @xmath5 contribute to the integral in eq .
[ eq : a1 ] , the lower limit is @xmath317 if @xmath327 and @xmath5 if @xmath328 . if @xmath174 for optimum @xmath66 lies within the range @xmath314 to @xmath315 and @xmath208 is parabolic through @xmath174 , then @xmath329 , which diverges at @xmath173 .
close to @xmath173 eq .  [ eq : a1 ] gives @xmath330 in agreement with the observed @xmath5-dependence for @xmath4 = 0.5 and 0.6 .
if @xmath174 lies outside the range @xmath314 to @xmath315 and if @xmath331 , eq .
[ eq : a1 ] gives @xmath332 where we identify @xmath318 with @xmath12 . in all cases
we expect a significant reduction in slope @xmath179 when @xmath5 increases through @xmath317 due to the reducing superconducting volume fraction .
this is not observed in our data .
the range of the broad distribution can be estimated as follows . ignoring the small variation through the `` knee '' feature , the slope @xmath333 increases continuously up to the main peak ( fig .
[ dgdtfig ] & fig .
[ gsnvstfig ] ) .
since there is no reduction of slope anywhere below @xmath162 we conclude that @xmath334 and thus @xmath335 , the nominal doping . for samples exhibiting an @xmath336 dependence between @xmath162 and @xmath173
the range must extend at least from the nominal @xmath201 to @xmath174 with a significant probability @xmath337 . unless @xmath313 drops discontinuously to zero at @xmath174 , which seems unlikely
, we require that the spread extends an equal range on the opposite side of @xmath174 to avoid a slope change above @xmath162 .
so @xmath338 , making a minimum total range @xmath339 .    thus to explain our data the doping inhomogeneity would have to extend over the range @xmath201 to @xmath340 with width @xmath339 . not only is this range very wide , but it only appears to exist on one side of the nominal doping @xmath201 ( always towards @xmath174 ) .
contrary to the expectation that the distribution @xmath313 should be reasonably symmetric around @xmath201 and have a mean value @xmath341 , we find instead that it would have to be very asymmetric , extending from @xmath201 to well beyond @xmath174 , with a mean doping substantially different from @xmath201 .

 @xmath7 increases strongly with @xmath4 at low temperature , compatible with a mass renormalisation @xmath8 at @xmath4 = 1 , and decreases weakly with @xmath4 at high temperature . 
 a superconducting transition is seen in all samples from @xmath4 = 0.2 to 1 , with transition temperatures and condensation energies peaking sharply at @xmath4 = 0.4 . 
 superconducting coherence lengths @xmath9  and @xmath10  are estimated from an analysis of gaussian fluctuations . for many dopings 
 we see features in the @xmath6 and @xmath5-dependences of @xmath11 in the superconducting state that suggest superconducting gaps in three distinct bands . 
 a broad `` knee '' and a sharp mean - field - like peak are typical of two coupled gaps . 
 however , several samples show a shoulder above the sharp peak with an abrupt onset at @xmath12 and a @xmath5-dependence @xmath13 . 
 we provide strong evidence that the shoulder is not due to doping inhomogeneity and suggest it is a distinct gap with an unconventional @xmath5-dependence @xmath14 near @xmath12 . 
 we estimate band fractions and @xmath5 = 0 gaps from 3-band @xmath15-model fits to our data and compare the @xmath4-dependences of the band fractions with spectroscopic studies of the fermi surface .    
 the electronic specific heat @xmath16 measured to room temperature contains a wealth of quantitative information about the electronic spectrum of metallic systems over an energy region @xmath17100mev about the fermi level , crucial for understanding high - temperature superconductivity 
 . measurements of the electronic specific heat have played an important role in revealing key properties of the copper - oxide based ` cuprate ' high - temperature superconductors ( htscs ) . 
 some examples include the normal - state `` pseudogap''@xcite , the bulk sample inhomogeneity length scale@xcite , and more recently evidence that the superconducting transition temperature is suppressed due to superconducting fluctuations@xcite . in this work 
 we extend such measurements to the iron - arsenide based ` pnictide ' htscs . here 
 we present results obtained for polycrystalline samples of ba@xmath1k@xmath2fe@xmath3as@xmath3 ( @xmath4 = 0 to 1.0 ) using a high - resolution differential technique@xcite .    with this technique we directly measure the difference in the specific heat capacities of a doped sample and an undoped reference sample ( bafe@xmath3as@xmath3 ) . 
 this eliminates most of the large phonon term from the raw data and yields a curve dominated by the difference in electronic terms . 
 features of the electronic specific heat that would otherwise be masked by the large phonon background are then clearly visible in the raw data over the entire temperature range . 
 central to the success of this technique are measurements on a series of samples at closely spaced doping intervals , so that systematic trends in the the relatively small difference in phonon terms between sample and reference can be identified and appropriate corrections made . after making these corrections , the differences in electronic specific heat 
 are determined with a resolution of @xmath18 0.1 mj mol@xmath19 k@xmath20 , i.e. up to 1 in 10@xmath21 of the total heat capacity , at temperatures from 2k to 380k and in magnetic fields from 0 t to 13 t . during a measurement 
 run the total specific heats of the sample and reference are also measured . using information on the electronic contribution deduced from our differential measurements we are able to extract the total phonon contribution from the total specific heat with a high degree of confidence , and crucially without recourse to arbitrary fitting and extrapolation procedures - a severe shortcoming of conventional heat capacity measurements in this temperature range . 
 this allows us to determine a harmonic phonon spectrum which we compare with inelastic neutron data . "
"the munics project is a wide area @xmath0-band selected photometric survey in the @xmath7 passbands aiming at two main scientific goals , namely    * the identification of galaxy clusters at redshifts around unity , and * the selection of a fair sample of field early - type galaxies at similar redshifts for evolutionary studies .    near - ir selection
is an efficient tool for tracing the massive galaxy population at redshifts around unity because of its high sensitivity for evolved stellar populations even in the presence of moderate star formation activity .
thus a @xmath8-band selected survey can provide a very useful database for the investigation of the formation and evolution of the cluster as well as the field population of massive galaxies .
clusters of galaxies are of prime interest in extragalactic astronomy and cosmology .
the @xmath9 evolution of their number density and correlation function are sensitive tests for structure formation theories and especially the density parameter @xmath10 .
models of structure formation predict that if @xmath11 , the number density of clusters of richness class 1 declines by a factor of @xmath12 between @xmath13 and @xmath14 . on the other hand , if @xmath15 , the number density declines only by a factor of @xmath16 in the same redshift range ( eke , cole , & frenk 1996 ; bahcall , fan , & cen 1997 ; fan , bahcall , & cen 1997 ) .
furthermore , clusters of galaxies allow to find large numbers of massive galaxies at higher redshift and thus represent unique laboratories to study the evolution of galaxies in high density regions as a function of redshift . while the number of clusters known at redshifts @xmath17 is steadily increasing , _ uniformly selected _ samples of clusters at high redshift are still deficient in the optical and near - ir wavelength ranges .
the formation and evolution of the population of massive galaxies is still a matter of lively and controversial debate .
no general agreement has been reached yet regarding the formation era of spheroidals . while models of hierarchical galaxy formation ( cole et al .
1993 ; kauffman & charlot 1998 ) consistently predict a steep decline in the number density of massive spheroidals , they have a rather large number of free parameters , some of which involve ill - understood processes . observation has not yet been successful in constraining the ranges of the involved model parameters tightly enough , so that comparisons between theory and experiment are difficult to interpret .
moreover , measuring the evolution of the number density of early - type galaxies @xmath18 to redshifts of unity is by itself a difficult undertaking , suffering from too small samples and strong selection effects , therefore yielding contradictory results ( e.g. totani & yoshii 1998 ; benitez et al .
1999 ; shade et al . 1999 ; broadhurst & bouwens 1999 ; barger et al .
the munics project uniformly covers 1 square degree in the @xmath1 and @xmath0 near - ir bands .
the survey area consists of 8 @xmath19 randomly selected fields at high galactic latitude , as well as 13 @xmath20 fields targeted towards @xmath6 qsos .
the @xmath5 detection limits for a point source are @xmath21 in the @xmath0-band and @xmath22 in the @xmath1-band .
the data have been acquired at the 3.5 m telescope at calar alto observatory using the @xmath23 camera .
optical photometry in the @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 bands was obtained for a subsample of the survey fields covering 0.35 square degrees in total .
these data have been obtained at the 2.2 m telescope at calar alto observatory and the 2.7 m telescope at mcdonald observatory .
these data will enable us to determine photometric redshifts for the galaxies and thus are of great importance in selecting and confirming cluster candidates as well as individual galaxies for follow - up spectroscopy .
figure 1 shows @xmath0 vs. @xmath24 color magnitude diagrams for population synthesis models based on the bruzual & charlot 1995 code ( bruzual & charlot 2000 ) , together with a subsample of the munics data .
note that the @xmath24 color of a late m - type star is @xmath25 , and therefore any object having redder color must be redshifted , with the exception of extreme stellar objects like brown dwarfs .
those are not expected to be very numerous down to our sensitivity limits .
therefore the @xmath24 color is a very powerful selection tool for picking out the evolved populations of massive galaxies at redshifts around unity and larger .
figure 2 ( right panel ) shows the photometric redshift distribution of 371 galaxies which were detected in _ all _ 5 passbands in a small subarea of @xmath26 and have a @xmath24 color @xmath27 , confirming the usefulness of the @xmath24 selection .
the left panel demonstrates that we can reliably reconstruct the sed of early - type galaxies at high redshift from our @xmath28 data .
data reduction and calibration of the near - ir data is completed and reduction of the optical data is almost completed . here
we present first results regarding detection of clusters and the surface density of eros .
the surface density of extremely red objetcs ( eros ) defined in terms of @xmath24 as determined from 0.35 square degrees of data is given in table 1 .
as soon as the optical data become fully available further investigation of the nature of such objects will be possible , as well as comparisons to previous studies which mostly use @xmath29 or @xmath30 for defining eros , and have surveyed much smaller areas at comparable depth .
.surface densities as a function of @xmath24 color as derived from a total of 0.35 square degrees .
[ cols='^,>,<',options='header ' , ]     assuming that the @xmath24 and @xmath31 colors for lbds 53w091 ( spinrad et al .
1997 ) are typical for eros , all objects with @xmath32 have to be considered as ero candidates .
the values of table 1 then point to higher surface densities than the values obtained by thompson et al .
( 1999 ) , which were based on an @xmath33 color and a survey area of 0.04 square degrees .
in recent years it became clear that an early type population in clusters was well in place at redshifts of at least 0.8 ( e.g. stanford , eisenhardt , & dickinson 1998 ) .
thus we may hope to detect these clusters by looking for overdensities of red objects with colors resembling the color sequence of cluster early - type galaxies .
the surface density field is divided into ( overlapping ) slices in @xmath24 color .
these slices are then smoothed by a kernel of the angular size of a cluster core at the apropriate redshift for that particular color range .
cluster candidates are identified as overdensities in this data cube .
figure 3 shows the redshift distribution for objects in the vicinity of a high redshift cluster candidate detected in this fashion as a demonstration of the efficiency of the technique .
the cluster candidate is first detected as an overdensity of red objects in @xmath24 . then this detection is verified by looking at the histogram of photometric redshifts in the vicinity of the cluster candidate .

"due to the strong radiation coming from hot stars , the cooler stars having later spectral types ( f  m ) are thought to be more benign hosts for habitable planets . still ,
also the cool stars show strong flaring activity and probably numerous coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) .
magnetic activity of the planet host star , especially the strong magnetic activity exhibited by many rapidly rotating young stars , has profound effects on the planets and their habitability ; strong flares and cmes are thought to even be able to strip a close - by planet of its atmosphere ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ? * lammer et al .
additionally , these processes are also relevant for stellar evolution , as stars lose mass and angular momentum via stellar winds and cmes .    in the sun cmes
are seen regularly , the average daily occurrence rate during the activity minimum being 0.5 and during the maximum 6 , with one solar cme containing on average 10@xmath1 kg of material ( see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ?
* gopalswamy et al . 2009 ) ) . on the sun ,
flares and cmes are often closely correlated , their association increasing with flare energy ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?
* yashiro et al . 2006 ) ) .
a few studies have therefore aimed to estimate stellar cme rates from flares , and relations between flare and cme parameters known from the sun ( ( * ? ? ?
* aarnio et al . 2012 ) ; ( * ? ? ?
* drake et al . 2013 ) ; ( * ? ? ?
* leitzinger et al . 2014 ) ; ( * ? ? ?
* osten & wolk 2015 ) ) .
many studies have shown that young stars have very energetic ultra violet flares ( see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ?
* osten & wolk 2009 ) ) , but very few systematic studies of the stellar coronal mass ejections exists .
there is a handful of detections of stellar cmes , but they are very rare ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?
* houdebine et al . 1990 ) ; ( * ? ? ?
* fuhrmeister & schmitt 2004 ) ; ( * ? ? ?
* gnther & emerson 1997 ) ; ( * ? ? ?
* leitzinger et al . 2011 ) ) .
the observations indicate velocities ranging from about twice the value for very fast solar cmes ( 5800km / s seen in ad leo ; ( * ? ? ?
* houdebine et al . 1990 ) ) to slightly slower than the values seen in the slowest solar cmes ( 84 km / s also seen in ad leo ; ( * ? ? ?
* leitzinger et al . 2011 ) ) .
the slow velocities observed at times can be explained by the cme being seen in projection .    for their large impact on the environments of planets , and also on the stellar angular momentum evolution , it is crucial to decipher the cme occurrence rate with stellar age and spectral type .
the doppler signal of a mass ejection is always seen in projection .
it is strongest when plasma is moving towards the observer and weaker for other directions .
doppler shifts and line asymmetries with enhanced blue wings of stellar emission lines can be interpreted as plasma ejected from the star .
the material released in cmes is mainly hydrogen as the cme core is often built by a filament , and they can be detected in the h@xmath0 line .
the blue enhancement caused by a cme is an absorption feature when seen against the stellar disc , and an emission feature when seen outside the disc .
the time that the ejecta can be seen against the stellar disc is quite short for many projections , meaning that emission features would be more common than absorption features . on the other hand
, the material would need to be quite dense to be seen in emission .
the velocities of cmes span from few hundreds of km / s to some thousands of km / s .
the exact value naturally depends on the energetics of the event itself , but also on the projection effects .
the maximum velocity is only achieved if the material is ejected directly towards the observer .
these high speeds also mean that detecting cmes does not require very high spectral resolution .
we have gone through the archival data of more than 40 single active stars observed with narval and espadons , and also obtained new observations for a handful of targets . even with a careful analysis no cmes were found , except on v374  peg .
v374  peg is a young , active m4 dwarf which has been extensively studied ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?
* donati et al . 2006 ) ; ( * ? ? ? * morin et al . 2008 ) ) .
we investigated the long - term photometric and spectroscopic variability of this star , and also studied archival espadons data of the h@xmath0 line - profiles ( ( * ? ? ?
* vida et al . 2016 ) ) .
the spectra obtained in 2005 showed a cme event : one real cme that was preceded by two failed events ( see fig .
[ v374peg ] ) .
we estimated that the minimum cme mass for the real event was @xmath2 g .
in addition , we predicted the cme rate using the formalism by ( * ? ? ? * leitzinger et al .
( 2014 ) ) , and found out that the star should have 15 - 60 cmes per day .
we detected only one in 10 hours of observations 
clearly less than predicted .
line of v374  peg .
the arrows show the complex cme event with two failed eruptions and finally one real cme .
( from ( * ? ? ?
* vida et al .
an efficient way for getting a better handle on the cme rate in young stars is to monitor open clusters with different ages using multi - object spectroscopy . in this way
many cool stars of known age can be simultaneously observed , increasing the chances of detecting cmes .
our first attempt was done at eso vlt using vimos spectrograph of a young open cluster blanco  1 ( pi leitzinger ) .
the results from these observations have been published , but unfortunately no cmes were detected ( leitzinger et al .
still , we estimated an upper limit of four cmes per day per star , and that we should have detected at least one cme per star with a mass of @xmath3 g .
after the blanco  1 campaign we have observed also other young open clusters . ic  2391 , ngc  2516 , and ngc  3532 were observed using efosc2 at eso s new technology telescope ( pi leitzinger ) .
three further clusters h  per , ic  348 , and ngc  1662 were targeted with the alfosc instrument on the nordic telescope ( pi korhonen ) .
unfortunately , many of the not observing campaigns were hampered by bad weather , and therefore we decided not to observe the oldest cluster , ngc  1662 , which anyway only had few observable cluster members . in total
the alfosc observations consist of some 2.5 nights worth of good quality data on h  per and ic  348 ( out of 9 allocated nights ) .
more details on the observed clusters is given in table [ clusters ] .
in this table the observing time is the total time allocated for that cluster .
.overview of the clusters observed for this project .
table gives the name of the cluster , age , number of observed targets , instrument used , spectral resolution , typical signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) , and the observing time allocated to the cluster .
[ cols='<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<',options='header ' , ]     from the efosc observations of ic  2391 , ngc  2516 , and hgc  3532 we only detected flares .
no cme signatures were seen .
also the h  per observations obtained with alfosc only show some flare events , but ic  348 looks more promising . our targets in this cluster include stars ranging spectral types g  m . most of the targets with earlier spectral types have h@xmath0 in absorption , and the later ones in emission .
an example of h@xmath0 line - profiles for star number 9 in our multi - object spectroscopy of ic  348 is given in fig .
[ ic348_profile ] .
this star is of spectral type late k 
early m. as can be seen , the line - profile shows clear variability . also , note that the persistent extra emission bump in the blue part of the profile is not from a cme event , but is due to fringing in the ccd at these wavelengths .

the average line - profile subtracted ( right side ) are shown .
clear variability in the h@xmath0 region is seen , and several events with blue shifted extra emission are discovered .
more thorough analysis of these data are needed for firmly confirming the nature of the events , and calculating their occurrence frequency .

we are detecting stellar cmes , but less than expected .
the detection is limited both by the intrinsic properties of the star and observing constraints .
the intrinsic properties include the cme occurrence rate , which depends on the activity level / age of the star , and the typical cme parameters ( velocity , mass , etc . ) .
the observing constraints are on one hand related to the timing of the observations ( time coverage and cadence ) , and on the other to the spectral properties ( resolution and s / n ) .
one has to also keep in mind that a fraction of the cmes are also lost due to the projection effects .
typical s / n of our observations is around 3040 , which is not high for studying small features in the spectral line - profiles . with these observations
we can detect only the massive cmes , comparable to the most massive solar events .
these events would be in the range of @xmath4 g . if we increase the s / n then we should also see less massive cmes . to test this
we have been granted uves bad weather programme on xi boo a and b , a 200myrs old g and k dwarf system .
the observations have a resolution of 40000 , s / n  600 , and time resolution of less than a minute . with these observations
we will be able to test the detectability of smaller cmes .
the so - far detected stellar cmes have all been on m dwarfs , and the ejecta were found to be in emission .
possibly the cmes on k and g stars are not dense enough to be detected in emission , and we are not quick enough to detect them in absorption .
another intriguing question is , whether the very active stars really have numerous cmes .
maybe we are not detecting many cmes , because there actually are only few of them ?
it has been hypothesised that the strong magnetic fields on young stars could actually prevent a filament from erupting in analogy to solar failed eruptions ( see drake et al .
2016 ) .

4000110889/14/nl / nde ." ," coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) are explosive events that occur basically daily on the sun . 
 it is thought that these events play a crucial role in the angular momentum and mass loss of late - type stars , and also shape the environment in which planets form and live . 
 stellar cmes can be detected in optical spectra in the balmer lines , especially in h@xmath0 , as blue - shifted extra emission / absorption . to increase the detection probability 
 one can monitor young open clusters , in which the stars are due to their youth still rapid rotators , and thus magnetically active and likely to exhibit a large number of cmes . 
 using eso facilities and the nordic optical telescope we have obtained time series of multi - object spectroscopic observations of late - type stars in six open clusters with ages ranging from 15 myrs to 300 myrs . 
 additionally , we have studied archival data of numerous active stars . 
 these observations will allow us to obtain information on the occurrence rate of cmes in late - type stars with different ages and spectral types . here 
 we report on the preliminary outcome of our studies . "
"the coupling of two or more driven diffusive systems can give rise to intricate and interesting behavior , and this class of problems has attracted much recent attention .
models of diverse phenomena , such as growth of binary films  @xcite , motion of stuck and flowing grains in a sandpile  @xcite , sedimentation of colloidal crystals  @xcite and the flow of passive scalars like ink or dye in fluids  @xcite involve two interacting fields . in this paper
, we concentrate on semiautonomously coupled systems  these are systems in which one field evolves independently and drives the second field .
apart from being driven by the independent field , the passive field is also subject to noise , and the combination of driving and diffusion gives rise to interesting behavior .
our aim in this paper is to understand and characterize the steady state of a passive field of this kind .
+ the passive scalar problem is of considerable interest in the area of fluid mechanics and has been well studied , see  @xcite for reviews .
apart from numerical studies , considerable understanding has been gained by analyzing the kraichnan model  @xcite where the velocity field of a fluid is replaced by a correlated gaussian velocity field .
typical examples of passive scalars such as dye particles or a temperature field advected by a stirred fluid bring to mind pictures of spreading and mixing caused by the combined effect of fluid advection and diffusion . on the other hand ,
if the fluid is compressible , or if the inertia of the scalars can not be neglected  @xcite , the scalars may cluster rather than spread out .
it has been argued that there is a phase transition as a function of the compressibility of the fluid  at large compressibilities , the particle trajectories implode , while they explode in the incompressible or slightly compressible case  @xcite .
it is the highly compressible case which is of interest in this paper .
+ specifically , we study and characterize the steady state properties of passive , non - interacting particles sliding on a fluctuating surface and subject to noise  @xcite .
the surface is the autonomously evolving field and the particles slide downwards along the local slope .
we consider a surface evolving according to the kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) equation .
this equation can be mapped to the well known burgers equation with noise , which describes a compressible fluid .
thus the problem of sliding passive particles on a fluctuating surface maps to the problem of passive scalars in a compressible fluid .
we are interested in characterizing the steady state of this problem , first posed and studied by drossel and kardar in @xcite .
using monte - carlo simulations of a solid on solid model and analyzing the number of particles in a given bin as a function of bin size , they showed that there is clustering of particles .
however their analysis does not involve the scaling with system size , which as we will see below , is one of the most important characteristics of the system .
we find that the two point density - density correlation function is a scaling function of @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( @xmath0 is the separation and @xmath1 is the system size ) and that the scaling function diverges at small @xmath2 .
the divergence indicates formation of clusters while the scaling of @xmath0 with @xmath1 implies that the clusters are typically separated from each other by a distance that scales with the system size .
a brief account of some of our our results has appeared in  @xcite .
+ scaling of the density - density correlation function with system size has also been observed in the related problem of particles with a hard core interaction , sliding under gravity on a kpz surface  @xcite .
however , the correlation function in this case has a cusp singularity as @xmath3 , in contrast to the divergence that we find for noninteracting particles .
thus , while clustering and strong fluctuations are seen in both , the nature of the steady states is different in the two cases . in our case ,
clustering causes a vanishing fraction of sites to be occupied in the noninteracting case , whereas hard core interactions force the occupancy of a finite fraction . in the latter case , there are analogies to customary phase ordered states , with the important difference that there are strong fluctuations in the thermodynamic limit , leading to the appellation fluctuation dominated phase ordering ( fdpo ) states .
the terminology strong clustering states is reserved for the sorts of nonequilibrium states that are found with noninteracting particles  a key feature being the divergent scaling function describing the two point correlation function .
+ in the problem defined above , there are two time scales involved , one associated with the surface evolution and the other with particle motion .
we define @xmath4 as the ratio of the surface to the particle update rates . while we see interesting variations in the characteristics of the system under change of this parameter , the particular limit of @xmath5 is of special importance .
there is a slight subtlety here as the limit @xmath5 does not commute with the thermodynamic limit @xmath6 .
if we consider taking @xmath5 first and then approach large system size ( @xmath6 ) , we obtain a state in which the surface is stationary and the particles move on it under the effect of noise . in this limit of a stationary surface ,
we obtain an equilibrium problem .
this is the well known known sinai model which describes random walkers in a random medium .
we will discuss this limit further below .
now consider taking the large system size limit first and then approach @xmath7 ; this describes a system in which particles move extremely fast compared to the evolution of the local landscape .
this leads to the particles settling quickly into local valleys , and staying there till a new valley evolves .
we thus see a non - equilibrium scs state here , but with the features that the probability of finding a large cluster of particles on a single site is strongly enhanced .
we call this limiting state the extreme - strong clustering state ( escs ) ( fig .
[ omega ] ) . the opposite limit shown in fig .
[ omega ] is the @xmath8 limit where the surface moves much faster than the particles . because of this very fast movement , the particles do not get time to `` feel '' the valleys and they behave as nearly free random walkers .
+ the equilibrium limit ( @xmath5 followed by @xmath6 ) coincides with the sinai model describing random walkers in a random medium  @xcite .
this problem can be analyzed analytically by mapping it to a supersymmetric quantum mechanics problem  @xcite and we are able to obtain closed form answers for the two quantities of interest  the two point correlation function @xmath9 and the probability distribution function of finding @xmath10 particles on a site @xmath11 .
surprisingly , we find that not only do these results show similar scaling behavior as the numerical results for @xmath12 ( nonequilibrium regime ) but also the analytic scaling function describes the numerical data very well .
the only free parameter in this equilibrium problem is the temperature and we choose it to fit our numerical data for the nonequilibrium system .
interestingly , the effective temperature seems to depend on the quantity under study .
+ the kpz equation contains a quadratic term which breaks the up - down symmetry , thus one can have different behavior of the passive scalars depending on whether the surface is moving downwards ( in the direction of the particles , corresponding to advection in fluid language ) or upwards ( against the particles , or anti - advection in fluid language ) . in this paper , we will consider only the case of advection .
one can also consider dropping the nonlinear term itself ; this leads to the edwards - wilkinson ( ew ) equation for surface growth .
the problems of kpz anti - advection and passive sliders on an edwards wilkinson surface are interesting in themselves and will be addressed in a subsequent paper  @xcite . + apart form the static quantities studied above , one can also study the dynamic properties of the system .
bohr and pikovsky  @xcite and chin  @xcite have studied a similar model with the difference that they do not consider noise acting on particles . in the absence of noise , all the particles coalesce and
ultimately form a single cluster in steady state , very different from the strongly fluctuating , distributed particle state under study here .
references  @xcite and  @xcite study the process of coalescence in time .
further , they find that the rms displacement for a given particle increases in time @xmath13 as @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is equal to the dynamic exponent of the surface , indicating that the particles have a tendency to follow the valleys of the surface .
drossel and kardar  @xcite have studied the rms displacement in the same problem in the presence of noise and observe the same behavior .
we confirm this result in our simulations and observe that the variation of @xmath4 does not change the result .
+    . in the @xmath5 limit one
gets different kinds of states depending on how one approaches it .
the @xmath8 is the free particle limit .
the arc shoes that there is a similarity between the results of the equilibrium sinai limit and the non - equilibrium scs at @xmath12 . ]
the arrangement of this paper is as follows . in section
ii , we will describe the problem in terms of continuum equations and then describe a discrete lattice model which mimics these equations at large length and time scales .
we have used this model to study the problem via monte carlo simulations .
section iii describes results of our numerical simulations .
we start with results on the various static quantities in the steady state and define the scs .
we also report on the dynamic quantities and the effect on steady state properties of varying the parameter @xmath4 .
section iv describes our analytic results for the equilibrium sinai limit of a static surface and the surprising connection with results for the nonequilibrium problem of kpz / burgers advection .
the evolution of the one - dimensional interface is described by the kpz equation @xcite @xmath16 here @xmath17 is the height field and @xmath18 is a gaussian white noise satisfying @xmath19 . for the passive scalars ,
if the @xmath20 particle is at position @xmath21 , its motion is governed by @xmath22 where the white noise @xmath23 represents the randomizing effect of temperature , and satisfies @xmath24 .
equation  ( [ passive ] ) is an overdamped langevin equation of a particle in a potential @xmath25 that is also fluctuating , with @xmath26 determining the speed of sliding . in the limit when @xmath27 is static ,
a set of noninteracting particles , at late times would reach the equilibrium boltzmann state with particle density @xmath28 . on the other hand , when @xmath25 is time dependent , the system eventually settles into a strongly nonequilibrium steady state .
the transformation @xmath29 maps eq .
( [ kpz1 ] ) ( with @xmath30 ) to the burgers equation which describes a compressible fluid with local velocity @xmath31    @xmath32    the above equation describes a compressible fluid because it does not have the pressure term , which is present in the navier stokes equation .
the transformed eq .
( [ passive ] ) describes passive scalar particles advected by the burgers fluid    @xmath33    the ratio @xmath34 corresponds to advection ( particles moving with the flow ) , the case of interest in this paper , while @xmath35 corresponds to anti - advection ( particles moving against the flow ) . + rather than analyzing the coupled eqs .
( [ kpz1 ] ) and  ( [ passive ] ) or equivalently eqs .
( [ burgers ] ) and  ( [ burgerspassive ] ) directly , we study a lattice model which is expected to have similar behavior at large length and time scales .
the model consists of a flexible , one - dimensional lattice in which particles reside on sites , while the links or bonds between successive lattice sites are also dynamical variables which denote local slopes of the surface .
the total number of sites is @xmath1 .
each link takes either of the values @xmath36 ( upward slope @xmath37 ) or @xmath38 ( downward slope @xmath39 ) .
the rules for surface evolution are : choose a site at random , and if it is on a local hill @xmath40 , change the local hill to a local valley@xmath41 ( fig .
[ picture1 ] ) . after every @xmath42
surface moves , we perform @xmath43 particle updates according to the following rule : we choose a particle at random and move it one step downward with probability @xmath44 or upward with probability @xmath45 .
the parameter @xmath46 ranges from 1 ( particles totally following the surface slope ) to 0 ( particles moving independently of the surface ) . in our simulations
, we update the surface and particles at independent sites , reflecting the independence of the noises @xmath47 and @xmath23  @xcite .
the ratio @xmath48 controls the relative time scales of the surface evolution and particle movement .
in particular , the limit @xmath5 corresponds to the adiabatic limit of the problem where particles move on a static surface and the steady state is the thermal equilibrium state .
+ to see how the lattice model described above describes a kpz surface , consider the mapping of the above model to the well known asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) : consider an up slope to be a particle on a lattice and a down slope to be an empty space ( hole ) .
the flipping of a hill to a valley then corresponds to the motion of a particle ( exchange of particle and hole ) . a coarse grained description of the asep leads to the kpz equation  @xcite .
the continuum description of the asep , obtained by coarse graining over regions which are large enough to contain many sites , involves the density of particles @xmath49 and the local current @xmath50 .
these are connected through the continuity equation    @xmath51    the local current can be written as    @xmath52    where @xmath53 is the particle diffusion constant , @xmath54 is a gaussian noise variable and @xmath55 is the systematic contribution to the current associated with the local density @xmath56 . using the expression for the bulk asep with density @xmath56 for @xmath57 , we have    @xmath58    where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the particle hopping probabilities to the right and left respectively , with our one - step model corresponding to @xmath61 and @xmath62 .
+ since we identify the presence ( absence ) of a particle in the lattice model with an up ( down ) slope , we may write    @xmath63    using eqs .
( [ current]),([systematic ] ) and ( [ connection ] ) in eq .
( [ continuity ] ) leads to    @xmath64    which is the kpz equation ( eq .
( [ kpz1 ] ) ) with an additional constant term , and @xmath65 and @xmath66 .
note that the signs of the constant term and @xmath67 are opposite .
thus a downward moving surface ( corresponding to @xmath68 ) has positive @xmath67 .
the constant term can be eliminated by the boost @xmath69 , but its sign is important in determining the overall direction of motion of the surface .
the case @xmath70 which is of interest to us thus corresponds to the lattice model in which particles move in the same direction as the overall surface motion . + the parameters @xmath4 and @xmath46 defined in the lattice model
are connected to the continuum equations as follows . in the limit of a stationary surface ,
we achieve equilibrium and the particles settle into in a boltzmann state with particle density @xmath28 , here h(x ) is the surface height profile and @xmath71 is the inverse temperature .
@xmath71 is related to @xmath46 by @xmath72 and to the parameters @xmath26 and @xmath73 in eq .
( [ passive ] ) by @xmath74 .
thus @xmath75    the parameter @xmath4 can not be written simply in terms of the parameters in the continuum equations , because it modifies eq .
( [ kpz1 ] ) as we now show .
@xmath4 is the ratio of the update speeds or equivalently the time between successive updates of the particles ( @xmath76 ) and surface ( @xmath77 ) .
the noises @xmath78 and @xmath79 in eqs .
( [ kpz1 ] ) and ( [ passive ] ) can be written as @xmath80 and @xmath81 respectively . here
@xmath82 is noise of @xmath83 , uncorrelated in time , white in space while @xmath84 is uncorrelated noise of @xmath83 .
the factors of @xmath85 in the terms indicate that the strength of the noise depends on how frequently noise impulses are given to the particles ; the square root arises from the random nature of these impulses .
thus the change in height ( @xmath86 ) in time @xmath77 and the distance traveled ( @xmath87 ) in time @xmath76 are respectively -    @xmath88 + \sqrt{\delta t_s d_h } \widetilde \zeta_h(x , t )   \label{connect2}\end{aligned}\ ] ]    @xmath89 + \sqrt{\delta t_p \kappa } \widetilde \zeta(t ) \label{connect3}\ ] ]    we now identify @xmath77 and @xmath76 with the monte - carlo time step @xmath90 as @xmath91 and @xmath92
. we can thus replace @xmath77 by @xmath93 and take it to be the natural continuous time .
we thus get    @xmath94 + \sqrt{\omega } \zeta_h(x , t )   \label{kpz3}\end{aligned}\ ] ]    @xmath95    we can see that the @xmath4 dependence in the above equation can not be removed by a simple rescaling of the parameters of the equation .
( [ kpz1 ] ) is recovered as a special case of eq .
( [ kpz3 ] ) on setting @xmath12 .
we start with the simplest case @xmath96 ; surface updates are attempted as frequently as particle updates , and both particles and surface always move only downwards . in our simulations
, we work with @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the total number of particles and there are @xmath1 sites in the lattice .
the two point density - density correlation function is defined as @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the number of particles at site @xmath101 .
[ advncorr ] shows the scaling collapse of numerical data for various system sizes ( @xmath1 ) which strongly suggests that for @xmath102 , the scaling form @xmath103 is valid with @xmath104 .
the scaling function @xmath105 has a power law divergence @xmath106 as @xmath107 , with @xmath53 close to 3/2 . the data for @xmath108 points to @xmath109 .
+ this numerical result matches with an exact result of derrida et .
@xcite for a slightly different model .
as we have seen in the previous section , the single step model which we use for monte - carlo simulations , can be mapped on to an asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) .
the particles / holes in the asep map to the up / down slopes in our model and the flipping of a hill to a valley is equivalent to swapping a particle with a hole . in  @xcite , apart from particles and holes , a third species called the second - class particles are introduced which act as holes for the particles and particles for the holes .
when translated to the surface language , these second class particles behave like the sliders in our model , with the difference that they are not passive : there is no surface evolution at a site where second - class particles reside .
the effect of non - passivity is relatively unimportant for kpz advection - like dynamics of the surface , as particles mostly reside on stable local valleys while surface evolution occurs at local hilltops .
moreover , if the number of second class particles is small , the probability of the rare event where they affect the dynamics of local hills goes down even further . with only two such particles in the full lattice , probability @xmath110 that they are at a distance @xmath0 , is proportional to the two point correlation function @xmath9 . the exact result  @xcite @xmath111 matches very well with our prediction for the same quantity , @xmath112 .
+ the result for @xmath9 also allows us to calculate the quantity @xmath113 first defined in  @xcite ; the lattice is divided into @xmath114 bins of size @xmath115 and we ask for the number @xmath113 of particles in the same bin as a randomly chosen particle .
@xmath113 is a good measure of clustering - if @xmath113 rises linearly with @xmath115 , one concludes that the particles are fairly spread out , while if @xmath113 saturates or shows a decreasing slope , one concludes that particles are clustered .
@xmath113 is related to the two point correlation function through @xmath116 , using which we obtain @xmath117 .
this form fits the numerical result for @xmath98 better ( fig .  [ advbin ] ) than the @xmath115-independent form of  @xcite .
+      another quantity of primary interest is the probability @xmath11 that a given site is occupied by @xmath10 particles . for @xmath118
, this quantity shows a scaling with the total number of particles , which in turn is proportional to the system size @xmath1 .
we have ( see fig .  [ advdensity ] ) @xmath119 with @xmath120 .
the scaling function @xmath121 seems to fit well to a power law @xmath122 with @xmath123 ( fig .
[ advdensity ] ) , though as we shall see in section iv , the small @xmath124 behavior may follow @xmath125 . we can use the scaling form in the above equation to calculate @xmath126 , @xmath127 , which , as we have seen above , is borne out independently by the numerics .
numerical data for @xmath128 ( which is not a part of the scaling function in eq .
( [ probability ] ) ) shows that the number of occupied sites @xmath129 varies as @xmath130 with @xmath131 , though the effective exponent seems to decrease systematically with increasing system size @xmath1 .
+      to evaluate the fluctuations of the quantity @xmath11 about its mean , we evaluated the standard deviation  @xmath132 where the brackets denote an average over time .
we find that this quantity does not decrease even in the thermodynamic limit @xmath6 .
let us ask for the probability density function @xmath133@xmath134 describing the values taken on by @xmath11 .
as seen in ( fig .
[ errdensity ] ) , this distribution does not change when we increase the averaging time ( main figure ) or the length ( inset ) .
thus @xmath133@xmath134 approaches a distribution with a finite width in the thermodynamic limit rather than a delta function .
this clearly indicates that there are large fluctuations in the system which do not damp out in the thermodynamic limit .
large fluctuations , which do not decrease with increasing system size , are also a feature of the fdpo state for particles with a hard core interaction  @xcite .
the root mean square ( rms ) displacement @xmath135 of a tagged particle has been studied earlier  @xcite .
@xmath136 is found to obey the scaling form    @xmath137    where @xmath138 , with @xmath139 for small @xmath124 .
the requirement that @xmath136 has to be independent of @xmath1 in the limit @xmath6 leads to @xmath140 .
the value of @xmath15 above is the same as the dynamic exponent of the kpz surface .
the dynamic exponent @xmath141 of a surface carries information about the time scale of evolution of valleys and hills ; the landscape evolves under surface evolution and valleys / hills of breadth @xmath142 are typically replaced by hills / valleys in time of order @xmath143 .
thus the observation @xmath144 suggests that the particles follow the valley movement .
+ we have also evaluated the autocorrelation function @xmath145 and find that it scales with the system size as    @xmath146    again , @xmath147 , reaffirming our conclusion that particles tend to follow valleys .
the scaling function shows a power law behavior @xmath148 with @xmath149 as @xmath150 .
+      the exponents defined in the above sections can be connected to each other by simple relations using scaling analysis .
for instance , @xmath151 , @xmath53 and @xmath152 are related by    @xmath153    this can be proved by substituting the scaling form of eq .
( [ correlation ] ) and @xmath154 in the equation @xmath155 ; the last equation can be obtained by using the definition of @xmath9 and using @xmath97 .
we can also relate @xmath156 , @xmath151 and @xmath157 by    @xmath158    which can be derived using the normalization condition @xmath159 and then substituting for @xmath128 and the scaling form of eq .
( [ probability ] ) .
our results from simulations are consistent with these relations .
+ the following picture of the steady state emerges from our results .
the scaling of the probability distribution @xmath11 as @xmath160 and the vanishing of the probability of finding an occupied site ( @xmath161 ) suggest that a large number of particles ( often of the order of system size ) aggregate on a few sites .
the scaling of the two - point density - density correlation function with @xmath1 implies that the particles are distributed over distances of the order of @xmath1 , while the divergence of the scaling function indicates clustering of large - mass aggregates .
thus the evidence points to a state where the particles form a few , dense clusters composed of a small number of large mas aggregates and these clusters are separated on the scale of system size .
we choose to call this state as the strong clustering state ( scs ) .
the divergence at origin of the two - point density - density correlation function as function of the separation scaled by the system size , is its hallmark .
the information we get from results on dynamics is that the particles have a tendency to follow the surface .
this is brought out by the fact that the scaling exponent describing the rms displacement comes out to be equal to the dynamic exponent of the kpz surface . +      to see how the system behaves when we change the relative speeds of the surface and particle evolution , we vary the parameter @xmath48 ( @xmath42 and @xmath43 being respectively the number of successive surface and particle update attempts ) in the range @xmath162 . when @xmath163 ( particles faster than the surface ) , we regain the scaling form of eq .
( [ correlation ] ) for the two point correlation function .
the scaling function also diverges with the same exponent . while the probability distribution for occupancy @xmath11 shows similar scaling with system size as eq .
( [ probability ] ) , the scaling function @xmath121 shows a new feature  it develops a peak at large @xmath10 ( fig .
[ advdensityomega ] ) .
this peak at large @xmath10 indicates that the probability of finding nearly all the particles at a single site is substantial . a heuristic argument for the appearance of this peak is now given .
consider a configuration in which a large number of particles ( nearly equal to the total number of particles ) reside in a local valley .
when this valley is replaced by another one nearby under surface dynamics , all the particles tend to move to the new one .
if the number of particle updates is greater than surface updates , there is a substantial probability that all the particles are able to move to the new valley before it is itself replaced by another one .
thus there is a significant probability of the initial cluster surviving intact for a fair amount of time .
numerically , we also find that    @xmath164    for @xmath165 , the particles settle down slowly in valleys and @xmath166 where @xmath167 and @xmath168 are respectively the times between successive surface and particle updates .
though @xmath166 ; for large enough @xmath1 , the survival time of the largest valley @xmath169 is always greater than the particle sliding time @xmath170 .
thus we expect that particles will lag behind the freshly formed valleys of small sizes but would manage to cluster in the larger and deeper valleys , which survive long enough .
we thus expect a clustering of particles and scaling to hold beyond a crossover length scale ( @xmath171 ) .
we can estimate the crossover length by equating the time scales of surface and particle rearrangements  @xmath172 , which yields @xmath173 .
using @xmath139 , we have @xmath174 .
numerical simulation results are shown in fig .
[ advcorrslow ] which shows that the data deviates from scaling and power law behavior at small @xmath0 , due to the crossover effect .
the data suggests that    @xmath175    as we can see from fig .
[ advcorrslow ] ( main graph ) , the curve flattens out at small values of @xmath0 , so for @xmath176 ( @xmath177 ) , the function @xmath178 in the equation above should follow @xmath179 while it should go to a constant for @xmath180 .
we can determine @xmath171 from @xmath9 by separating out the @xmath0 dependent part ; if we scale @xmath9 by @xmath1 , we obtain the quantity @xmath181
. we can now determine @xmath171 as the value or @xmath0 where the scaled data starts deviating from the power law behavior @xmath182 . from fig .
[ advcorrslow ] , ( inset ) @xmath183 .
a similar exercise for @xmath184 leads to @xmath185 .
a clean determination of @xmath171 for @xmath186 requires data for very large values of system size , beyond the scope of our computational capabilities .
+ the probability distribution @xmath11 continues to show the same scaling form ( eq .
( [ probability ] ) ) for @xmath187 , but the scaling function @xmath121 in this case dips at large values of @xmath124 ( fig .
[ advdensityomega ] ) in contrast to the peak seen for @xmath188 .
the exponent @xmath15 describing the rms displacement of particles remains unchanged under a change in @xmath4 , again indicating that particles follow the movement of valleys on the large scale .
+    the other parameter of interest is @xmath46 , defined in section ii  when we make a particle update , we move the particle downhill with probability @xmath44 and uphill with probability @xmath45 .
so far we have discussed the results for the case @xmath189 , where particles always move downhill .
decrease in @xmath46 reduces the average downhill speed of particles , while the valley evolution rates are unaffected . thus decreasing @xmath46 causes an effect similar to increasing @xmath4 and a crossover length scale is introduced .
the particles lag behind the freshly formed local valleys but settle down in the deeper , longer surviving global valleys .
the numerical results again guide us to the form @xmath190 for the correlation function .
analogous to @xmath165 case , we have extracted @xmath191 from the numerical data .
we find @xmath192 .
values of @xmath46 lower than @xmath193 require data for system sizes that are beyond our computational limitations .
to approach the problem analytically we take the extreme limit of @xmath5 . in this limit
, the surface is stationary .
the particles move on this static surface under the effect of noise and the problem becomes a well known equilibrium problem - the sinai model  @xcite for random walkers on a random landscape .
it is well known that for the kpz surface in one - dimension , the distribution of heights @xmath194 in the stationary state is described by    @xmath195\propto \exp\left[-{\nu \over { 2d_h}}\int \left(\frac{dh(r')}{dr'}\right)^2 dr'\right ] \label{equisurface}\end{aligned}\ ] ]    thus , any stationary configuration can be thought of as the trace of a random walker in space evolving via the equation , @xmath196 where the white noise @xmath197 has zero mean and is delta correlated , @xmath198 .
we impose periodic boundary conditions as for the lattice model , without loss of generality - @xmath199 .
+ the passive particles moving on top of this surface as , we remember , move according to eq .
( [ passive ] ) . since this is an equilibrium situation , @xmath200 where @xmath201 is
the temperature and @xmath202 is the boltzmann constant .
since the particles are non - interacting , we can deal with a single particle and instead of the number of particles @xmath203 at a site @xmath0 , we consider the probability @xmath204 that the particle will be located between @xmath0 and @xmath205 . in the long time time , the particle will reach its thermal equilibrium in the potential @xmath194 and will be distributed according to the gibbs - boltzmann distribution , @xmath206 where @xmath207 is the partition function .
note that @xmath208 in eq .
( [ gibbs1 ] ) depends on the realization of the potential @xmath209 and varies from one realization to another .
our goal would be to compute the distribution of @xmath208 over different realization of the random potential @xmath194 drawn from the distribution in eq .
( [ equisurface ] ) .
note that the distribution of @xmath194 in eq .
( [ equisurface ] ) is invariant under the transformation @xmath210 . in other words ,
the equilibrium density @xmath208 defined in eq .
( [ gibbs1 ] ) will have the same distribution if one changes the sign of @xmath194 in eq .
( [ gibbs1 ] ) . for later simplicity
, we will make this transformation now and replace @xmath208 instead by the following definition @xmath211 where the transformed partition function is now given by @xmath212 .
our strategy would be first to compute the @xmath10-th moment of the random variable @xmath208 in eq .
( [ gibbs2 ] ) .
it follows from eq .
( [ gibbs2 ] ) -    @xmath213    where we have used the identity @xmath214 to rewrite the factor @xmath215 . here
@xmath216 is the standard gamma function .
next , we make a further change of variable in eq .
( [ nmom1 ] ) by writing @xmath217 .
note that as @xmath124 varies from @xmath218 to @xmath219 , the new dummy variable @xmath220 varies from @xmath221 to @xmath219 . making this substitution in eq .
( [ nmom1 ] ) we get , @xmath222   \label{nmom2}\end{aligned}\ ] ] where we have used the explicit expression of the partition function , @xmath212 .
the constant @xmath223 $ ] .
we are now ready to average the expression in eq .
( [ nmom2 ] ) over the disorder , i.e. , all possible realizations of the random potential @xmath224 drawn from the distribution in eq .
( [ equisurface ] ) . taking the average in eq .
( [ nmom2 ] ) ( we denote it by an overbar ) , we get using eq .
( [ equisurface ] ) , @xmath225\right\ } \nonumber \\    & & + n\beta(h(r)+u ) ] \label{avmom1}\end{aligned}\ ] ] where the normalization constant @xmath226 of the path integral in eq .
( [ avmom1 ] ) will be chosen so as to satisfy the sum rule , @xmath227 .
next we shift the potential by a constant amount @xmath220 , i.e. , we define a new function @xmath228 for all @xmath229 that reduces eq .
( [ avmom1 ] ) to the following expression , @xmath230\right\ } + n\beta v(r ) \right ] \label{avmom2}\end{aligned}\ ] ] this path integral can be viewed as a quantum mechanical problem in the following sense .
all paths ( with the measure shown above ) starts from @xmath231 and ends at @xmath232 . at the fixed point @xmath0 ( where we are trying to calculate the density distribution )
, these paths take a value @xmath233 which can vary from @xmath221 to @xmath219 .
this can be written , using the quantum mechanical bra - ket notation , @xmath234 the first bra - ket inside the integral in eq .
( [ pi1 ] ) denotes the propagation of paths from the initial value @xmath220 to @xmath235 at the intermediate point @xmath0 and the second bra - ket denotes the subsequent propagation of the paths from @xmath235 at @xmath0 to the final value @xmath220 at @xmath1 .
the hamiltonian @xmath236 corresponds to the operator @xmath237 . interpreting @xmath238 to be the  position ' of a fictitious particle at the fictitious  time ' @xmath229
, this operator has a a standard kinetic energy term and a potential energy which is exponential in the  position ' @xmath235 . the right hand side of eq .
( [ pi1 ] ) can be rearranged and simplified as in the following - @xmath239 thus , @xmath240 where we have used the completeness condition , @xmath241 with @xmath242 being the identity operator.at this point , it may be helpful and less confusing notationally if we denote the  position ' @xmath235 of the fictitious quantum particle by a more friendly notation @xmath243 , which will help us thinking more clearly .
thus , the eq .
( [ pi2a ] ) then reduces to,@xmath244 to evaluate the matrix element in eq .
( [ pi3 ] ) , we need to know the eigenstates and the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian operator @xmath245 .
it is best to work in the  position ' basis @xmath246 . in this basis
, the eigenfunctions @xmath247 of @xmath236 satisfies the standard shrdinger equation , @xmath248 valid in the range @xmath249 .
it turns out that this shrdinger equation has no bound state ( @xmath250 ) and only has scattering states with @xmath251 .
we label these positive energy eigenstates by @xmath252 , where @xmath253 is a continuous label varying from @xmath218 to @xmath219 .
a negative @xmath253 eigenfunction is the same as the positive @xmath253 eigenfunction , and hence it is counted only once . with this labeling , it turns out that the differential equation can be solved and one finds that the eigenfunction @xmath254 is given by , @xmath255 where @xmath256 is the modified bessel function with index @xmath53 .
note that , out of two possible solutions of the differential equation , we have chosen the one which does not diverge as @xmath257 , one of the physical boundary conditions .
the important question is : how to determine the constant @xmath258 in eq .
( [ sol1 ] ) ?
note that , unlike a bound state , the wavefunction @xmath254 is not normalizable . to determine the constant @xmath258
, we examine the asymptotic behavior of the wavefunction in the regime @xmath259 . using the asymptotic properties of the bessel function ( when its argument @xmath260 ) , we find that@xmath261 . \label{sol2}\ ] ] on the other hand , in the limit @xmath259 , the schrdinger equation ( [ seq1 ] ) reduces to a free problem , @xmath262 which allows plane wave solutions of the form , @xmath263 , \label{sol3}\ ] ] where @xmath264 represents the incoming wave from @xmath265 and @xmath266 represents the reflected wave going back towards @xmath265 with @xmath267 being the reflection coefficient . the amplitude @xmath268 is chosen such that the plane waves @xmath269 are properly orthonormalized in the sense that @xmath270 where @xmath271 is the dirac delta function . comparing eqs .
( [ sol2 ] ) and ( [ sol3 ] ) in the regime @xmath259 , we determine the constant @xmath258 ( up to a phase factor ) , @xmath272 the square of the amplitude @xmath273 ( which is independent of the unknown phase factor ) is then given by @xmath274 where we have used the identity , @xmath275 .
therefore , the eigenstates of the operator @xmath236 are given by @xmath276 , such that @xmath277 and in the @xmath246 basis , the wavefunction @xmath278 is given ( up to a phase factor ) by the exact expression @xmath279 we now go back to eq .
( [ pi3 ] ) where we are ready to evaluate the matrix element @xmath280 given the full knowledge of the eigenstates of @xmath236 .
expanding all the kets and bras in the eigenbasis @xmath276 of @xmath236 , we can rewrite eq .
( [ pi3 ] ) as follows , @xmath281 the @xmath246 integral on the right hand side of eq .
( [ momn1 ] ) can be expressed in a compact notation , @xmath282 substituting the exact form of @xmath254 from eq .
( [ eigen1 ] ) , we get @xmath283 fortunately , the integral on the right hand side of eq .
( [ com2 ] ) can be done in closed form  @xcite and we obtain , @xmath284 substituting this matrix element back in eq .
( [ momn1 ] ) , we arrive at our final expression , @xmath285 to determine the constant @xmath226 , we first put @xmath286 in eq .
( [ fin1 ] ) .

( [ corrfin1 ] ) ( with @xmath365 ) and note that this expression is valid for all @xmath1 .
this exact expression of the correlation function was first derived by comtet and texier  @xcite in the context of a localization problem in disordered supersymmetric quantum mechanics .

[ advcorr ] and  [ advdensity ] , though with different values of @xmath71 .
the correlation function matches with @xmath383 while @xmath384 describes the probability distribution of number data well .
however , @xmath128 ( and thus @xmath385 ) does not agree closely in the two cases .
the equilibrium case can also be used to shed light on the dynamical properties of the nonequilibrium steady state .
we compared our results for @xmath386 with the density - density autocorrelation function in the adiabatic @xmath5 limit . to find the latter ,
we simulated a surface with height field @xmath387 evolving according to kpz dynamics , and evaluated the density using the equilibrium weight @xmath388 . as shown in  @xcite , the results with @xmath389 agree with the autocorrelation function in the nonequilibrium system , apart from a numerical factor .
+ it is surprising that results in this equilibrium limit describes the non - equilibrium state so well . in the non - equilibrium case ,
the driving force behind particle motion and clustering is the surface fluctuation fluctuation while the equilibrium case , it is the temperature .
the common feature in both the cases is the surface terrain .
thus , in some region of parameter space the surface motion mimics temperature and causes the particles to redistribute in a certain way .
why the equivalent temperature for various quantities is different is not clear and deserves further study .
in this paper , we have described our results on the problem of particles sliding on a kpz surface , with both the surface and the particles moving in the same direction , corresponding to the case of particle advection by a noisy burgers flow .
we see that in the steady state , the two - point density - density correlation function diverges near the origin as a function of distance scaled with the system size .
this is an indicator of strong clustering of particles and the defining characteristic of a new kind of state - the strong clustering state ( scs ) .
+ questions arise about the robustness of the strong clustering state - does clustering survive in the case of anti - advection where the surface and particles move in opposite directions to each other ? what happens if we change the symmetry properties of the driving field , and have driving by an edwards - wilkinson ( ew ) surface instead of the kpz surface ?
does the phenomenon survive in higher dimensions ? these questions will be addressed in a subsequent paper  @xcite , where it will be shown that the steady state is of the scs kind in all these cases , even though the degree of clustering differs from one case to another .

 the fluctuating field in our case is provided by a surface governed by the kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) equation and the sliding particles follow the local surface slope . as the kpz equation can be mapped to the noisy burgers equation , the problem translates to that of passive scalars in a burgers fluid . 
 we study the case of particles moving in the same direction as the surface , equivalent to advection in fluid language . 
 monte - carlo simulations on a discrete lattice model reveal extreme clustering of the passive particles . 
 the resulting strong clustering state is defined using the scaling properties of the two point density - density correlation function .

"lately it has become increasingly clear that an intrinsic property of the cuprate high - temperature superconductors is the presence of nanoscale inhomogeneity of the low - energy electronic spectral weight in the doped cuo@xmath0 planes . in particular
this inhomogeneity seems to come in the form of stripes which are unidirectional spin and charge density modulations . from neutron scattering experiments for example
there is evidence for a universal spin response in the hole doped materials that is consistent with dynamic spin stripe correlations.@xcite the tendency for stripe formation in a doped antiferromagnet is well established and can be understood naively as an effect of the competition between strong antiferromagnetic correlations and delocalization of the doped holes.@xcite    concurrently with the increasing evidence for stripes there is also a picture emerging in which there are electronic quasiparticles in the normal state and bogoliubov quasiparticles in the superconducting state in line with that expected for a fermi liquid or a bcs superconductor.@xcite in particular , for underdoped materials these quasiparticles appear to be confined in momentum space to the so called nodal region of the brillouin zone , near momentum ( @xmath1 ) , where the d - wave gap has a node in the superconducting state .
the recent observations by scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( sts ) of a `` stripe glass '' in which there are static unidirectional electronic domains makes the problem even more intriguing.@xcite in fact , this suggests that the two phenomena of stripes and nodal quasiparticles can coexist .
a most basic question is how well defined two dimensional quasiparticles can exist in a system where there is one dimensional charge order .    in this paper
we consider a mean - field model of a system with long - range charge - stripe order and short - range spin - stripe correlations that we suggest may hold some clues to this puzzle . from landau theory describing the low - energy long - distance physics
it is known that spin stripe order always implies charge stripe order but not the converse@xcite thus providing the logical background for the study of such a system .
assuming translational symmetry along the stripe direction allows us to define a momentum resolved local density of states ( ldos ) which is integrated only over states with a particular longitudinal momentum .
although this may not be an experimentally measurable quantity it will give some essential insights into the significance of the lack of long - range spin order .
what we find is an abrupt change in the manifestation of the charge stripe order at low energies as a function of the momentum along the fermi surface .
quite strikingly , as shown in figure [ disorderedldos ] , the spin disorder averaged ldos at the fermi energy when integrated only over the states which contribute to the nodal region spectral weight show very little evidence of the charge order and is nearly homogeneous and isotropic , while the full ldos including also antinodal , near ( @xmath2 ) , states clearly display charge order .
this should be contrasted with results for a system with both charge and spin order , as shown in figure [ orderedldos ] , for which the ldos has a clear signature of charge order for antinodal as well as nodal states .
the results thus suggest that an effectively two dimensional , isotropic nodal state can indeed coexist with static charge stripe order provided that there is no static spin order .
we have considered long range charge order but the results are expected to apply equally well for a system with only local stripe correlations provided that the charge order is effectively static and the spin fluctuations are fast compared to the experimental probe .
another basic question concerns the nature of the fermi surface of the underdoped cuprates .
angle resolved photoemission ( arpes ) experiments observe the famous nodal region `` fermi arc '' which is most readily consistent with a large fermi surface closed around the @xmath3 point but where the spectral weight is suppressed by the so called `` pseudogap '' in the antinodal region.@xcite the large fermi surface picture has been challenged by the recent observations of high frequency quantum oscillations of the hall resistivity in strong magnetic fields in yba@xmath0cu@xmath4o@xmath5 ( ybco ) that seem to imply small fermi pockets.@xcite we show that exactly this distinction is found between a system with long - range spin stripe order and a system with only short - range spin stripe correlations . in simulations of commensurate stripe ordered systems ( fig .
[ pockets ] ) we find a nodal region hole pocket together with a quasi - one dimensional fermi surface section that are replaced by a large fermi surface in a disordered stripe system ( fig .
[ disorderedldos ] ) .
it is known that a c - axis magnetic field can enhance stripe order@xcite , thus providing a possible connection to the observations of quantum oscillations .
if the high - field measurements indeed probe a stripe ordered state which the arpes measurements generally do not our results may thus provide an explanation for the apparent discrepancy between the two probes where the fermi arc could be regarded as the remnant in the disordered state of a nodal hole pocket .    in light of this
we also consider the implications of the enlarged stripe unit cell and find that the hole density of a hole pocket will be decreased by a factor of two for even charge period and four for odd charge period compared to an estimate that assumes no long - range order .
based only on the stripe periodicity we can also set an estimated upper limit to the size of a nodal hole pocket of 1.6% of the full brillouin zone for a period four stripe and 4% for a period five stripe with larger pockets merging into open sections . from the canonical relation between doping and stripe periodicity@xcite
we may expect period five for `` 1/10 '' doping and period four for `` 1/8 '' doping .
quantum oscillations have been observed for doping close 1/10 whereas for 1/8 doping the high field limit remains to be explored.@xcite for the period four stripes we expect either no oscillations , corresponding to only open orbits , or possibly a smaller frequency of up to 450 t , corresponding to the maximum pocket size .
if a sharp distinction is found between 1/8 and 1/10 it would be a dramatic confirmation of stripe order .
although hole pockets may explain the frequency of quantum oscillations they can not explain why the hall coefficient ( r@xmath6 ) may be negative at low temperature.@xcite this has lead to suggestions for the formation of electron pockets due to broken translational symmetry.@xcite however , the location of such electron pockets are in regions of the brillouin zone ( along @xmath7 to @xmath8 ) where there is no evidence from photoemission of any substantial spectral weight and they must be considered highly speculative . for a stripe ordered system , in particular , we argue that electron pockets arise only as an artifact of a mean - field type description that effectively ignores the interactions on a stripe .    here , instead
, we show that the stripe band with open orbits may be electron - like thus providing an alternative explanation for a negative hall coefficient .
the sign of r@xmath6 for the stripe band depends sensitively on the changes of the fermi velocity over the fermi surface which depends in turn on the band structure parameters as well as the character ( strength and periodicity ) of the stripe order .
the apparent nonuniversality of the hall coefficient@xcite in different materials is not unexpected if stripe order plays a role .
the model we consider is a tight - binding model on a square lattice in a static potential which couples to the local spin density and which may or may not have long - range stripe order .
we can think of the potential as a strong inhomogeneous magnetic field that is generated self - consistently from an interacting model such as the large - u hubbard model in the hartree - fock approximation.@xcite the hamiltonian reads @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the electron destruction operator at site @xmath11 and with spin @xmath12 .
we will also refer to the stripe perpendicular ( @xmath13 ) and stripe parallel ( @xmath14 ) directions as @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) and @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) respectively .
the hopping is given in a standard fashion where @xmath19 indicates nearest neighbors , @xmath20 next - nearest neighbors .
we will use energy units such that @xmath21 and we take @xmath22 . for the hubbard model with on - site interaction @xmath23
we would identify the quantity @xmath24 with a self - consistent spin - density wave .
( in a stripe ordered state there would also be a charge density wave generated potential of strength @xmath25 , with @xmath26 the local density variation , which will in general be quite negligible compared to @xmath27 . ) in this paper we will not attempt to solve any microscopic model self - consistently , instead the hamiltonian provides a simple means of simulating a system with stripe correlations by choosing appropriate potentials @xmath28 .
this type of model has been considered before in several publications@xcite , however not to consider systems with only charge stripe order and neither has the local density of states been explored in any detail .
we will always consider systems which are less than half - filled thus providing a most simple caricature of a hole - doped cuprate with stripe order or stripe correlations .
we also consider only commensurate stripe order in which the stripe period is some integer multiple of the lattice spacing .
although fluctuating incommensurate stripe correlations are found experimentally , stripe ordered states always appear to be commensurate.@xcite

the right column shows the full fermi surface together with the centermost bragg planes ( dashed ) and the first brillouin zone ( highlighted ) .
the size of a pocket in b is 0.7% of one quadrant ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) and the actual hole density of the nodal pockets is also 0.7% , with a total hole doping including the antinodal stripe states of 17.5% ( @xmath34 ) .
the size of a pocket in d is 1.2% of one quadrant while the hole density of the nodal pockets is only 0.6% , with a total doping of 12.5% ( @xmath35 ) .
the boxes show the estimated upper limit to the size of a pocket as discussed in the text.,width=302 ]    let us first consider the case of a completely regular periodic potential . to exemplify the results we consider bond - centered stripes with charge periodicity four and five .
for the period four array we choose a potential @xmath36 with @xmath37 and for the period five array @xmath38 with @xmath39 .
note the size of the magnetic unit cell transverse to the stripes which is twice the charge period only for even periodicities .
considering now also the antiferromagnetic ( af ) @xmath40 modulation ( eq . [ h ] ) along the stripes we have primitive vectors of the magnetic unit cell @xmath41 for period four and @xmath42 and @xmath43 for period five . the modulation of the potential is basically the simplest possible consistent with bond - centered stripes .
a self - consistent potential is expected to have a somewhat smaller amplitude on a stripe than between stripes because of the higher hole density but such a consideration would not change the qualitative features of our results .
the standard mean field treatment of an antiferromagnet gives a lower and upper hubbard band separated by an indirect gap ( for @xmath44 ) while the stripes in the form of @xmath45 phase shifts of the potential transfer some of that weight to midgap states . with moderate doping
, the chemical potential will lie in this midgap stripe band . depending on the magnitude of the potential and the doping
there may be additional states at the fermi energy coming from the stripe modified lower and upper hubbard bands .
if the potential is large the lower band will be gapped away from the fermi energy leaving only the midgap stripe states which as we will find have weight primarily in the antinodal region .
if the potential is small the upper band will also cross the chemical potential , giving rise to electron pockets . for hole doping and considering as a guide
the large - u hubbard model such electron pockets are most likely unphysical and we make sure to choose to potential to avoid such states .
spectral weight in the nodal region most naturally arises from the lower band but does require a somewhat judicial choice of the magnitude of the potential . whether the stripes are bond - centered or site - centered is however not important for the qualitative features of the fermi surface .
we diagonalize the hamiltonian to get a spectrum @xmath46 with single - particle eigenstates @xmath47 ( @xmath48 includes band index and spin ) that only have spectral weight at momenta connected by multiples of the reciprocal lattice vectors of the stripe unit cell .
the zero - temperature single - particle spectral function is simply given by @xmath49 .
figure [ pockets ] shows the fermi surface ( integrated over a narrow window @xmath50 ) for the two realizations of stripe potentials . for this figure
we have chosen the fermi energy and corresponding hole doping to give a simple fermi surface with only two bands contributing , one band giving the nodal fermi pocket and one band giving the quasi - one dimensional antinodal weight .
the antinodal spectral weight is qualitatively not very sensitive to the fermi energy , the fermi surface only moves along the stripe direction @xmath18 as expected for a quasi - one dimensional band .
the nodal weight on the other hand is very sensitive to the details of the potential and the doping , in particular for higher doping several bands may contribute and give superimposed nodal hole pockets with different sizes .
we draw the following general conclusions from the calculations on ordered stripe arrays : ( 1 ) the size of a nodal hole pocket does not give the corresponding hole density without an a priori knowledge of the stripe order . naively , for a paramagnet with one pocket per quadrant of the full 1st brillouin zone
, one might infer a hole density which is @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the area fraction of a pocket . here
we find that the actual hole density is one half of this value @xmath53 for period four stripes and only one quarter @xmath54 for period five stripes , i.e. there are only two or one pocket respectively in the reduced first brillouin zone .
we have checked that these results generalize to longer stripe periodicities with the same distinction between even and odd periodicity .
thus , only for even periodicity is the relation between hole density and the size of a pocket the same as for an antiferromagnet.@xcite    \(2 ) the bulk of the hole density for this system is actually in the quasi - one dimensional stripe band which may dominate the charge transport.@xcite however , since the corresponding fermi surface section does not have any closed orbit this band would not give rise to quantum oscillations .
\(3 ) the size of the brillouin zone limits the size of a nodal pocket , larger pockets will merge to form extended fermi surface sections ( open orbits ) .
the size limit depends on the shape and orientation of the pocket , however we can make a general and conservative upper estimate by assuming that the extension of the pocket is of the same magnitude along both directions as indicated by the boxes in figure [ pockets ] ( b ) and ( d ) . with this
we estimate the maximum area fraction ( of the full extended bz ) to @xmath55 for charge period four and @xmath56 for period five .    the above estimate does appear to rule out a period four stripe ordered state in the system ( yba@xmath0cu@xmath4o@xmath57 ) with hole doping @xmath58 in which quantum oscillations were recently observed with a pocket of size 1.9%.@xcite the size is however well within the limit for a period five state , which may be reasonable given the observations by inelastic neutron scattering of magnetic correlations that are consistent with this stripe periodicity@xcite for charge - period five the size of the pocket would correspond to hole density of only 3.8% , while the remaining 6.2% hole density would according to this model reside in the quasi - one dimensional stripe band .
the cyclotron mass of a pocket is given by@xcite @xmath59 where we have used a lattice spacing of @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 is the area fraction of one quadrant of the brillouin zone and @xmath63 is energy in units of @xmath64 .
a problem with these pockets in relation to the experiments is that the dispersion is quite steep which gives a cyclotron mass of around @xmath65 electron masses for both the period four and period five stripes which is much smaller than the @xmath66 reported experimentally .
however , one may expect that strong correlations can significantly narrow the bands and increase the cyclotron mass .
the hall resistivity is negative under the conditions in which the quantum oscillations have been detected which from semiclassical transport theory implies electron like charge carriers instead of the expected hole like .
this led to a recent suggestion that electron pockets , not hole pockets , in a stripe ordered system may be responsible for the oscillations.@xcite in contrast to the hole pockets discussed in this paper such electron pockets are centered on the stripes and may appear with a suitable choice of the potential .
however , we would argue that they are unphysical as they correspond effectively to occupying states in the upper hubbard band of the stripe , with the relatively low energy being an artifact of the mean field like treatment of the stripe .
we can see this by considering a single site - centered stripe in the large @xmath67 limit .
self - consistently this corresponds to a large staggered potential outside of the stripe center row giving rise to a decoupled tight binding chain on the stripe.@xcite the problem with this is particularly obvious at half - filling of the stripe where the procedure gives a gapless electronic band instead of the appropriate insulator with a gap proportional to @xmath67 .
this discrepancy is related to the fact that the mean field treatment can not accurately describe the effectively paramagnetic state on the site - centered stripe .
clearly the naive stripe potential misses essential aspects of the interactions on a stripe , a deficiency that will remain also away from half - filling and for a smaller stripe potential .
the resolution to the negative hall resistivity may lie instead in the charge transport related to the open stripe bands@xcite with the oscillations being due to hole pockets .
for the transport properties of the quasi - one dimensional stripes it may be important to consider correlations@xcite as evidenced by the antinodal pseudogap but here we will do the standard semiclassical calculation .
following the presentation of ong@xcite , the sign of the hall conductivity is given by the integral over the fermi surface @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the scattering length vector with fermi velocity @xmath70 and relaxation time @xmath71 .
figure [ orbits]a shows constant energy curves of the `` stripe band '' of the charge period four system considered earlier ( same parameters ) . with increasing energy these evolve from electron pockets into open sections and into hole pockets with the hall coefficient changing continuously from negative ( electron - like ) to positive ( hole - like ) .
( we have assumed a @xmath72 independent relaxation time . )
figure [ orbits]b shows the area traced out by fermi velocities for the particular section marked by arrows as the fermi surface is followed across the brillouin zone where the velocities @xmath73 and @xmath74 corresponding to the longitudinal and transverse components respectively .
we see that the outer part of the fermi surface ( @xmath75 ) gives a hole - like contribution whereas the inner part ( @xmath76 ) is electron - like .
the particular fermi surface displayed in figure [ pockets ] has a hole - like open section but is close to the transition between hole - like and electron - like .
the sign of the hall coefficient depends sensitively on the curvature of fermi surface and the fermi velocity and small changes can switch the sign .
the fact that experimentally the sign of the hall coefficient in strong magnetic fields appears to be non - universal may be an indication that it is related to such open orbits .
a more realistic calculation of the stripe band - structure is needed including also an examination of the total hall coefficient due to a possibly electron - like open fermi surface section together with hole pockets .
( color online ) fermi surface sections ( a ) in the upper half of the first bz of the stripe band for the charge period four stripe ( same as in fig . [ pockets ] a , b ) for varying chemical potential .
the three lower sections are electron - like and the rest are hole - like . as explained in the text the hall coefficient is proportional to the area of the integral over the fermi velocity curve as shown in ( b ) for the section in ( a ) marked by arrows .
there is a contribution from both a hole - like and an electron - like loop .
the magnitude of the longitudinal ( @xmath73 ) and transverse ( @xmath74 ) velocities are calculated using a lattice spacing of @xmath60 and hopping @xmath61.,width=302 ]      let us also consider the local density of states of this system @xmath77 .
we will be interested in considering the connection between the spectral function and the local density of states at the fermi energy and in particular the distinction between nodal and antinodal states .
since momentum is conserved modulo @xmath45 along the stripe direction @xmath18 we can associate to every state a momentum @xmath78 and choose to make a partial sum in the ldos that only includes states with certain @xmath18 .
we define @xmath79    figure [ orderedldos ] shows the nodal and antinodal ldos for the period four array , the antinodal states have a higher density on sites @xmath800 or 1 while the nodal states have a higher density on sites @xmath802 or 3 ( with respect to the potential @xmath37 ) .
as emphasized in several other publications@xcite the nodal states derive from the antiferromagnet whereas the antinodal states are the `` stripe states '' living on domain walls of the antiferromagnet .
we will find that this distinction will be crucial when we in the next section consider a system without long range spin stripe order .

note that the high density regions are shifted by two sites between nodal and antinodal weight .
the antinodal weight has high density at the af domain walls of the stripe potential whereas the nodal weight has high intensity between .
also shown is the amplitude of the fourier transform of the ldos transverse to the stripe direction with the uniform density component @xmath81 normalized to one .
the ldos modulations in both regions is roughly 30% of the mean density .
( the combined total ldos modulation at the fermi energy , not displayed , is only around 5% .
the integrated charge modulation over all occupied states is around 4% . ) , width=302 ]
we will now consider a charge ordered but spin disordered system .
we generate a stochastic spin - stripe potential with a short correlation length through an update procedure @xmath82 where @xmath83 is a random number and apply a cutoff @xmath84 at every step . here
@xmath85 gives the sign of the potential for the corresponding spin - stripe ordered array which in the case of the simple charge - period four bond - centered stripe takes the value @xmath86 . the distribution is readily evaluated analytically and we find a disorder averaged correlation function @xmath87 with a short correlation length @xmath88
. we will take @xmath89 which we find gives a good correspondence with the ordered system considered previously , i.e. the same fermi energy gives roughly the same doping . in order to be able to consider large system sizes ( in the transverse direction ) we still assume antiferromagnetic order along the stripes .
assuming short - range correlations would broaden the states in @xmath18 but as far as the transverse charge order is concerned we do not expect this to have any significant impact .
for the numerical calculations we use a transverse system size @xmath90 which is large compared to the correlation length of the potential ( typically @xmath91 ) and diagonalize the system for a given static but random configuration of the potential and take the average over many realizations .
physically what we have in mind is a system with fluctuating short - range spin stripe correlations with some correlation length @xmath92 and frequency @xmath93
. the disorder average can thus be relevant either for a fast , compared to @xmath93 , but extended probe such as inelastic neutron scattering or arpes ( disorder average in real space ) or a slow but local probe such as sts ( disorder average in time ) .
there is of course a significant approximation involved in representing the spin fluctuations by a sequence of static spin configurations . in particular quasi - particle dynamics
will not be accurately represented using such a quasi - static spin approximation .
however for the gross and qualitative features of the spectral weight distribution we expect that the approximation can give reasonable results .

solid points are values for the stripe potential and open symbols for the actual spin densities which follow from the potential . the latter are multiplied by @xmath94 as discussed in the text . in ( a )
the @xmath95 position is on a stripe ( triangles ) or between stripes ( stars ) , where the smaller amplitude on a stripe is consistent with a higher hole density .

[ potential ] ) together with the ldos at the fermi energy of antinodal ( b ) and nodal states ( c ) .
the ldos is shown for an arbitrary section of the system and is plotted on the same relative scale as for the spin - stripe ordered system ( fig .
[ orderedldos ] ) .
the relative variations is around 18% for the antinodal ldos and around 3% for the nodal ldos .
the components at momenta @xmath97 and @xmath98 correspond to roughly 15% density variations of the antinodal ldos ( d ) and 1.5% ( barely visible in e ) for the nodal ldos variations with the rest of the variations being due to random disorder .
the total density modulation integrated over all filled states is around 3% .
the simulation is averaged over 10000 runs with system size 120@xmath96120.,width=302 ]      we think of the stripe potential as reflecting the instantaneous spin configuration .
clearly this disordered potential will not be a self - consistent mean field solution to the hubbard model .
nevertheless , to be physically reasonable we may at least require that the disorder averaged potential should be roughly self consistent in the sense that it faithfully reflects the average spin configuration .
for the potential as we have chosen it every site is equivalent up to signs given by @xmath99 , however for the actual disorder averaged spin density we need to distinguish between two inequivalent sites which are on average on a stripe ( @xmath800 or 1 ) or between a stripe ( @xmath802 or 3 ) with respect to the potential @xmath86 .
figure [ potential ] shows the corresponding spin - spin correlators @xmath100 , as well as the fourier transforms @xmath101 and @xmath102 . from the analytic expression for the correlation function of the potential , eqn .
[ correlator ] with @xmath89 , we can calculate @xmath103 with @xmath104 .
the spin - spin correlators are multiplied by a factor @xmath94 and the good agreement with the potential indicates that the averaged potential is quite close to being self - consistent for the hubbard model with @xmath105 .
the main source of the discrepancy is caused by the fact that the potential assumes on average a uniform magnitude of the local magnetization whereas a self - consistent calculation gives a smaller magnetization on the stripes ( fig .
[ potential]a ) consistent with a larger hole density .
this can be fine tuned without any significant impact on the subsequent results and we will prefer to keep the model as simple as possible .
let us now study the charge density in this system with short range spin correlations .
here we consider two objects , the disorder averaged local density of states @xmath106 and the disorder averaged spectral function @xmath107 where we can again divide the ldos into nodal and antinodal parts according to eqn .
[ ldos ] .
figure [ disorderedldos ] shows the spectral weight integrated over a window ( @xmath108)@xcite close to the fermi energy , as well as the corresponding nodal and anti - nodal ldos .
we take the fermi energy the same ( @xmath34 ) as for the period four stripe ordered system considered above which corresponds here to an average hole doping of around 18% . due to the disorder
the spectral weight is spread out such that the stripe fermi surface and nodal pocket loose their integrity and merge into a single large fermi surface which if we symmetrize with respect to stripes along both directions would close around the @xmath3 point .
what is particularly notable are the results for the ldos where the nodal ldos is almost uniform with only a very weak signature of the charge order whereas the antinodal ldos shows long range charge - stripe order not very different in magnitude from that of the stripe ordered system considered previously . for the nodal states there is an apparent restoration of the rotational symmetry of the lattice for the spin disordered system .
the results can be roughly understood based on the knowledge of the stripe ordered system in which the antinodal weight comes from stripe states that are centered on antiferromagnetic domain walls and are quite insensitive to whether or not there is long - range and static spin order .
the nodal states on the other hand live primarily between stripes for a spin - stripe ordered state and the spin fluctuations apparently conceal the stripes .
a complementary understanding can be found from earlier work on the same model where it was noted that in the presence of weak potential disorder the localization length transverse to the stripes of the antinodal states is of the order of or less than the stripe period whereas the localization length of the nodal states can be several times the stripe period.@xcite
the fermi momentum resolved charge order found here is yet another manifestation of what has been called the `` nodal - antinodal dichotomy '' in which the low - energy spectral properties are very different for the nodal and antinodal regions.@xcite in particular the enigmatic pseudogap is known from arpes to be exactly such a momentum resolved phenomenon in which there is a partial suppression of the antinodal spectral weight .
let us explore the implications of an antinodal pseudogap on our results in a qualitative fashion : first , it would lift the bulk of the antinodal spectral weight away from the fermi energy leaving only the nodal fermi arc .
in addition it would imply that the charge - stripe order may only be visible above the pseudogap energy scale .
the latter property does indeed seem to be realized for the `` stripe glass '' observed by tunneling spectroscopy for which the differential tunneling conductance is nearly uniform at low energies and only show the unidirectional modulations at energies around the pseudogap energy.@xcite these observations together with the results presented here give a very strong indication that the pseudogap is in fact related to stripes . also corroborating this picture is arpes data which find that the pseudogap disappears abruptly with the momentum along the fermi surface in going from @xmath8 to @xmath109@xcite in a fashion analogous to the charge stripe order presented here .
the pseudogap is then a strong correlation gap ( spin - gap ) on a single stripe characterized as an interacting quasi - one dimensional electron gas.@xcite in the work presented here any strong correlation effects apart from the stripe order itself are completely ignored but we do find that the antinodal spectral weight comes from the quasi - one dimensional stripe states thus providing a logical consistency with an antinodal pseudogap from stripes .
one way to argue why it may be reasonable to treat the stripe correlations separately is if there is a separation of energy scales in the renormalization group sense in which the antiferromagnetic correlations , which for a doped system correspond to stripe correlations , dominate and residual correlations which gives rise to the pseudogap become prominent at a lower energy scale.@xcite    as is well known for the underdoped cuprates the superconducting order occurs at an even lower energy scale . from , for example , arpes results on the gap evolution@xcite and sts results on the bogoliubov quasiparticle interference@xcite it is by now quite clear that long - range superconducting order is intimately linked to the nodal liquid which as we have found can be isotropic even in the presence of charge stripe order . in this context
we note that the spin stripe ordered la@xmath110ba@xmath111cuo@xmath112 has a significantly suppressed superconducting transition temperature while there is still a large antinodal pseudogap.@xcite the suppression of superconductivity in this system may thus be related to anisotropy of the nodal liquid due to spin stripe order.@xcite    as a continuation of this work the modeling of disordered stripes should be extended to include also some characterization of the pseudogap and a d - wave like pair - field which could allow for a more detailed comparison with sts and arpes results . for the ordered stripe phases work
is in progress to calculate the total conductivity resulting from the contributions of hole pocket and open stripe band and to characterize more generally the sign and oscillations of the hall resistivity in such a system .    to summarize
, we find that for a charge ordered but spin disordered stripe state there is a natural separation into nodal and antinodal states for which the latter shows a much stronger signature of the charge order . the local density of states at the fermi energy is almost homogeneous when integrated only over states that contribute to the nodal region spectral weight .
we also consider commensurate spin and charge stripe ordered systems where the fermi surface consists of a nodal hole pocket and an open ( quasi - one dimensional ) antinodal section .
the relation between the size of the pocket and the hole density depends on whether the charge periodicity is odd or even and we give upper estimates of the possible size of a pocket for charge period four and five of 1.6% and 4% respectively .
we find that the open section may be electron or hole like depending on the details of the stripe band structure .

 the disorder averaged local density of states is almost perfectly homogeneous when integrated only over states which contribute to the `` nodal '' spectral weight whereas it displays long range charge stripe order when integrated only over states which contribute to the `` antinodal '' spectral weight . 
 an effectively two dimensional isotropic nodal liquid can thus coexist with static charge stripes provided there is no static spin order . 
 we also study commensurate spin and charge stripe ordered systems where the fermi surface consists of a nodal hole pocket and an open `` stripe band '' section . 
 due to the stripe order the relation between hole density and size of a pocket will be reduced compared to a paramagnet by a factor of two for even charge period and four for odd charge period and we find an estimated upper limit on the area fraction of a hole pocket of 1.6% for charge period four and 4% for charge period five . 
 we also discuss why electron pockets are not expected for a stripe ordered system and show that the open fermi surface section may be electron like with a negative hall coefficient . "
"studying the epoch around @xmath10 is important for our understanding of the early stages of galaxy formation . it is around this time , when the age of the universe was less than a gyr , that the reionization of the hydrogen component of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) was substantially completed @xcite .
hundreds of @xmath10 galaxies have now been photometrically selected ( e.g. @xcite ) , and at least tens of lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) and many more ly@xmath2  emitters ( laes ) are now spectroscopically confirmed ( @xcite ) . while there are hints of substantial star formation at even higher redshifts ( @xcite ) , @xmath10 remains the earliest epoch for which robust galaxy samples are available .    at @xmath10 , galaxies are selected via the lyman break method ( @xcite ) , or because of strong ly@xmath2  emission @xcite .
both methods select star - forming galaxies , but the two populations differ .
not all lbgs have ly@xmath2  emission @xcite and laes can be missed by lbg surveys because they are faint in the continuum or their ly@xmath2  emission contaminates broad - band photometry .
studies of laes are an important complement to lbg surveys , because the faint continuum luminosities and high specific star formation rates of laes make them likely candidates for galaxy building blocks .    to date
, narrow - band imaging surveys have been very successful in finding laes at @xmath11 .
mulitwavelength observations have shown that these laes are typically ( but not always ) younger and less massive , and they have lower dust extinction than lbgs @xcite .
in addition , ly@xmath2  luminosity functions measured at @xmath11 , show little or no evolution with redshift @xcite . at higher redshifts measurements of the ly@xmath2
luminosity function may allow a determination of the neutral hydrogen fraction in the intergalactic medium and lae clustering could help constrain models of the patchiness of of the reionization process @xcite .
in fact , @xcite now report a measured decline in the ly@xmath2  luminosity function at @xmath12 , although this is not seen in a compilation of different data sets presented by @xcite .
spectroscopic searches for laes have the potential to detect objects with fainter line emission than purely narrow - band imaging , because they sample with a resolution closer to the intrinsic width of the emission line .
this is especially important at @xmath13 , where observing the faint end of the galaxy luminosity function is challenging .
however , the task is challenging and first efforts at blank sky surveys using multi - slit narrowband spectroscopy at keck observatory and the very large telescope ( vlt ) found only low and intermediate redshift interlopers @xcite .
more recently , different spectroscopic strategies have met success . @xcite
have found several faint serendipitous laes at @xmath14 in a search of 20% of the deep2 database . while the area subtended by deep2 slits
is only 21.6 arcmin@xmath15 , a large line - of - sight volume is sampled within in the relatively oh - free portion of the sky spectrum at @xmath16  .
in addition , @xcite found 27 @xmath17 laes in a single longslit spectrum ; their @xmath18 100 hour vlt observation reached a flux one to two orders of magnitude deeper than most other lae searches . at higher redshifts , slitless spectroscopy with
_ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) has uncovered a few sources at @xmath19 @xcite , and longslit spectroscopy of the critical lines of strong gravitational lenses has discovered low - luminosity laes at @xmath10 @xcite , as well as a few candidates at @xmath20 @xcite .
recently , wider areas have become accessible with multislit narrowband spectroscopy , and laes have been found at @xmath21 . using the inamori magellan areal camera and spectrograph ( imacs ; @xcite ) ,
@xcite carried out a blind spectroscopic search in 200 arcmin@xmath15 in the cosmic evolution survey ( cosmos ; @xcite ) and the 15 hour field of the las campanas infrared survey ( lcirs ; @xcite ) .
these observations reach a sensitivity fainter than @xmath22(ly@xmath2 ) at @xmath23 ( @xmath18 several @xmath24 erg s@xmath25 , as measured by @xcite and @xcite ) , and three lae candidates at @xmath23 were confirmed with further spectroscopy . following this success ,
we have carried out a deeper survey in the same fields ( dressler et al .

uncovering at least several sources at luminosities that were previously only reached with strong lensing searches @xcite .    of the three sources found by @xcite , none
are detected in the available continuum imaging , and only one has been previously detected in cosmos narrow - band imaging ( no narrow - band imaging is available in the 15h field ) . in this paper , we present new imaging of these laes from the near infrared camera and multi - object spectrometer ( nicmos ; @xcite ) .
these images , obtained through the @xmath0  filter with the nic2 camera , confirm the presence of the two laes in the 15h field . in 
2 we present our observations and data reduction , as well as the process by which we match our spectroscopically discovered sources with nicmos detections . in 
3 we discuss the properties of these three laes , and  4 contains a summary of our results .
we use @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and ab magnitudes throughout .
each of the three laes were observed for 5 orbits ( 13.4 ks ) with the nicmos 2 camera .
the images were then processed in several steps to make final mosaics .
first , images were corrected for the quadrant - dependent variable bias ( the `` pedestal effect '' ) , and south atlantic anomaly ( saa ) darks were subtracted from impacted orbits .
next , we used the iraf task _ rnlincor _ to correct for the count - rate dependent non - linearity documented by @xcite . with this approach ,
the zero point remained unchanged at @xmath0  = 23.69 . for our configuration of @xmath0  with nicmos 2 , the non - linearity correction was substantial , and amounted to @xmath29 mag for the @xmath0  = 23 - 26 magnitude sources in our images . following this correction , the images were sky subtracted , using the nicred package @xcite . then , the remaining vertical and horizontal bands in the images were removed by subtracting a model sky frame constructed by taking the median of each column and smoothing it by a three pixel wide boxcar .
( this step was repeated for rows to remove any top - to - bottom banding or gradients . ) after this , we identified bad pixels in the images following the procedures used by the multidrizzle software @xcite : a truth image was made by aligning the images and creating a median stack .
this image was shifted back to the frame of the original input image , and pixels deviant by more than 3 @xmath30 were flagged as bad pixels .
finally , images were combined with drizzle with bad pixels masked using parameters recommended in the dither handbook : pixfrac = 0.6 , and scale = 0.5 .
the final output pixels are 0.038 .
the resulting psf , measured from the two point sources in these images has a fwhm of 0.1 .
sensitivity was measured by randomly placing 0.6  diameter apertures in the image , rejecting those that fell on sources , and fitting a gaussian to the `` counts - per - aperture '' distribution , as described in @xcite .
we found a 5@xmath30 sensitivity of @xmath0  = 26.5 in this aperture .
using the point sources in our images , we measured the aperture correction to be 0.08 magnitudes , so the 5@xmath30 total sensitivity is @xmath0  = 26.4 ( for a point source ) . finally , using a few common sources per image , the astrometric solutions to the nicmos images
were aligned with the cosmos survey for the 10h field , and the sdss for the 15h field .      the spectroscopic search and confirmation data
are presented in @xcite , where a difference was discovered between the world coordinate system ( wcs ) zero - points of cosmos and that of our data .
namely , the position of msdm 80 + 3 in the cosmos / subaru narrow - band imaging is nearly 1  west of the position found by martin et al . in light of this offset
, we improved our technique for deriving coordinates , by mapping a wcs solution to images taken through our slitmask .
we tested these solutions for both the cosmos and 15h field , using dozens of objects ( per field ) that have continuum detections in our spectra .
we found ( 1@xmath30 ) position uncertainties of 03 - 05 along the slits , and 10 perpendicular to the slits .
the latter uncertainty naturally arises in all blind spectroscopic searches , because sources are not necessarily centered in the slits . for the cosmos field
, the slits are oriented e - w , so these uncertainties correspond to ra and dec , respectively . for the 15h field
the slit pa was -45 .    in figure [ stampfig ]
, we show the nicmos @xmath0  images at the positions of the three laes .
no obvious source is detected at the position of msdm 80 + 3 , but sources are detected within the 1@xmath30 position error ellipse for msdm 29.5 + 5 and just outside it for msdm 71 - 5 .
photometry is presented in table [ phot_table ] .
we used 0.6  diameter apertures , centered on the positions of the sources shown in figure [ stampfig ] for msdm 29.5 + 5 and msdm 71 - 5 , and at the position of the narrowband detection for msdm 80 + 3 ( see figure [ stamp80 + 3 ] ) .
a point source model was adopted for the aperture correction , as explained in  [ obs ] .
while more light will be missed from extended sources , this loss amounts to at most 0.1 to 0.3 magnitudes ( in addition to the point source aperture correction ) , as nearly all @xmath10 galaxies have half - light radii , @xmath31 @xcite .
as we can not accurately determine the amount of missed flux , we adopt the point source aperture correction of 0.1 magnitudes , and note this systematic uncertainty .    in order to determine whether the sources are likely to be associated with the laes , we calculated the probability that the nicmos detections in the 15h field are from foreground galaxies . to do this
we obtained the publicly available catalogs of the nicmos ultra - deep field@xcite .
for consistency with our aperture photometry of the laes , we used 06 diameter apertures .
to @xmath0  = 26.1 , which is the aperture magnitude of the fainter of the two detected sources , we found cumulative number counts of @xmath1860 arcmin@xmath32 .
therefore , there is less than a one per - cent chance of a foreground interloper falling within our positional error ellipse . for the brighter source
, this probability is about 50% lower .
we conclude with greater than @xmath33% confidence that each of the nicmos detected sources is indeed an lae discovered by @xcite .
strong ly@xmath2  emission can in some cases contribute appreciably to broadband flux density @xcite , and for our objects this could happen . at @xmath1 , ly@xmath2  is included in the wide @xmath0  bandpass , which covers approximately 0.8 to 1.4 .
however , the contribution is negligible for our objects our measured ly@xmath2  fluxes account for only 5 - 10% of the @xmath0  flux densities for the two detected sources .
this enhancement lies within our uncertainties , so no corrections are made to our photometry and equivalent width measurements .
these nicmos observations provide the first direct images of two sources ( msdm 29.5 + 5 and msdm 71 - 5 ) which had previously only been detected in our spectroscopic data . on the other hand , the source which is undetected in @xmath0 , msdm 80 + 3 , shows a strong detection in subaru narrowband imaging with the nb816 filter ( object # 55 in @xcite ) . in figure
[ stamp80 + 3 ] we show the narrowband image of msdm 80 + 3 , with our position error ellipse overlaid .
our improved coordinates for msdm 80 + 3 are roughly consistent with the nb816 source in murayama et al .
the newly derived position is 07 _ west _ of the nb816 detection , while the previous position given in martin et al .
east_. this position offset along the slit is still large compared to other sources , including those discussed in  2.2 and for 52 lower redshift line emitters that are in common between martin et al . and
the cosmos nb816 sample . given the slight offset perpendicular to the slit ( 04 ) shown in figure [ stamp80 + 3 ] , one possibility is that the ly@xmath2  emission from this object is extended , and our slit subtended an outlying region of the galaxy .
some evidence for this hypothesis is present in the subaru narrowband image ( figure [ stamp80 + 3 ] ) , where msdm 80 + 3 is marginally resolved .
the absence of continuum emission could indicate that the source is extended in the continuum , although extended ly@xmath2  emission need not imply a similarly extended stellar continuum .
the upper bound of @xmath9 dropout lbg sizes is @xmath34 02 ( in the rest - frame uv ; @xcite ) , which corresponds to 5.3 pixels in our drizzled nic2 images . using the iraf artdata package
, we verified that a galaxy of this size would be undetected in our nicmos data at @xmath0   @xmath35 .
it is tempting to conclude from the low - surface brightness signal at the position of msdm 80 + 3 in our nicmos image that it may be more extended in the rest - frame uv .
however , this lae fell on the bad central column in these observations , and similar artifacts appear at other locations along the column .
the weight maps produced by drizzle indicate that noise is @xmath36% higher at these locations relative to the rest of the image , so the extended feature is not significant .
nevertheless , the @xmath0  non - detection could imply that msdm 80 + 3 is more extended in the continuum than the other two laes ( msdm 29.5 + 5 and 71 - 5 ) , which have half - light - radii ( measured with sextractor ) of 015 and 014 .
the hypothesis that the ly@xmath2  emission may be extended is also supported by our line flux measurement , which is a factor of two lower than the subaru nb816 imaged line flux .
this difference is larger than is expected for a point source , unless the object fell on the edge of our 15-wide slit . as noted above , in the narrow - band image
coordinates , msdm 80 + 3 is 04 north of the slit - center . using the point source slit loss models from martin et al .
( 2008 ) , at this position we expect only about a 20% slit loss .
the effect of the non - uniform response of the nb816 filter on suprimecam is negligible for msdm 80 + 3 , because our measured wavelength is near the central wavelength of the nb816 transmission .
furthermore , lines at wavelengths away from the center of the nb816 bandpass would have decreased observed ly@xmath2  flux relative to our spectroscopic measurement the opposite of what we observe .
generally , sources found through blind spectroscopy do not fall at the center of the slit ; for larger samples the impact of slit - losses on the luminosity function is modeled statistically .
equivalent widths , uv luminosities , and uv continuum derived star formation rates are given in table [ phot_table ] .
we assume a flat uv spectrum ( @xmath37 ) , consistent with observations of laes with ly@xmath2  luminosities and redshifts similar to those of our objects @xcite , and with @xmath10 lbgs in the nicmos ultra deep field @xcite . therefore , although the center of the @xmath0  filter corresponds to @xmath38   in the rest frame , our best estimate is that k - corrections are negligible .
we note that @xmath39 at @xmath10 @xcite , so the uv - luminosities that we measure are consistent with typical sources observed at this redshift within a factor of two of @xmath22 for the two @xmath0detected sources .
star formation rates ( sfrs ) are derived using the 1500   conversion from @xcite .
uv - continuum based estimates of star - formation rates are thought to be more reliable than those from ly@xmath2 ; nevertheless , these continuum - based estimates come with several caveats .
first , the conversion is valid only when the characteristic stellar age is older than the main sequence lifetime of o- and b - stars . at young ages ( @xmath40 myrs ) ,
the true sfr may be a few times larger .
second , we have not corrected the uv - luminosities for dust extinction , so again , the sfrs given in table [ phot_table ] may be underestimated . however , in general , @xmath10 galaxies are not thought to be very dusty @xcite , so dust corrections to our sfrs need not be very large .
third , uncertainties in the imf slope and mass cutoffs may be just as important , as they can change the sfr by a factor of a few @xcite . on the other hand ,
the two - photon nebular continuum is not expected to make a significant contribution to the uv - luminosity , since it is generally dwarfed by the stellar contribution .
while some sources are purported to have spectra dominated by the two - photon continuum , such objects appear to be rare @xcite , and are predicted to have rest - frame ly@xmath2  equivalent widths @xmath41   ( @xcite , with coefficients from @xcite ) .
the equivalent widths that we measure are consistent with those of laes at high redshift , as shown in figure [ ewplot ] .
we do not make any correction for igm absorption on the ly@xmath2  emission , as has been done for some objects at @xmath10 ( e.g.  @xcite ) . while it is possible that the ly@xmath2  emission emergent from the galaxy is larger than observed , the amount of attenuation is uncertain because the resonant scattering of ly@xmath2  photons shifts the emission towards redder wavelengths @xcite .
it is not surprising that we do not observe any sources that are both uv luminous and have high - equivalent widths . as @xcite point out
, this may be a consequence of both classes of objects being rare , rather than a correlation of equivalent width with uv luminosity as has been suggested by @xcite .
the three laes that we present are consistent with the range of equivalent widths that are easily explained by `` normal '' stellar populations , with ages older than 10 myrs and a salpeter imf . however , deeper continuum observations of msdm 80 + 3 could prove that its equivalent width is much larger .
there are several different models that can explain very large equivalent widths .
first , extremely young ages and/or top - heavy initial mass functions ( imfs ) can result in rest - frame equivalent width @xmath42   ( e.g.  @xcite ) .
second , a multi - phase interstellar medium has sometimes been invoked to preferentially absorb uv continuum photons ( @xcite ) ; and third , gravitational cooling radiation in the absence of star formation is predicted to result in @xmath43    ( @xcite )
. however , such high equivalent width objects are probably rare , as only a few sources in figure [ ewplot ] lie at @xmath42  .
it is important to note that the uncertainty on such high equivalent width sources typically exceeds 100  because of weak continuum detections , so these measurements should be viewed with caution .
it is interesting to consider whether the laes in our survey would be selected as @xmath9 dropout lbgs at @xmath10 , because the connection between the two populations is currently unclear . while it is generally understood that laes can be missed by lbg searches when their continuum is too faint , the selection of brighter sources can also be influenced by strong line emission ( e.g.  @xcite ) . at @xmath44 ,
ly@xmath2  falls in the @xmath45 -band , and galaxies can sometimes be too blue in @xmath46 to be included in @xmath9dropout samples , even when an identical galaxy without ly@xmath2  emission would be included in such a sample .
( it is worth noting that such objects could be included in @xmath47 r - dropout samples , provided that the @xmath46 color is not too red . )
strong ly@xmath2  emission may influence the color selection of all three galaxies presented here . assuming a flat uv slope ( @xmath37 ) , we estimate @xmath48 and 1.3 for msdm 29.5 and msdm 71 - 5 , near the @xmath49 cut used by most lbg studies ( e.g. @xcite ) .
the inclusion of sources such as these would depend on photometric scatter and the true value of the uv slope .
on the other hand , msdm 80 + 3 , which is undetected in the @xmath0  images , would be unlikely to be included in @xmath9dropout samples .
the ly@xmath2  flux contributes substantially to the @xmath9band , so even in the absence of any continuum we would expect @xmath50 .
assuming @xmath8@xmath51 as inferred from our @xmath0  limit implies that we would expect @xmath52 .
therefore , even if msdm 80 + 3 could be detected in very deep imaging such as the udf , it would be much too blue to be included in the @xmath9 dropout samples .
this exercise emphasizes the importance of including ly@xmath2  emission in the modeling of lbg selection functions , as is done by @xcite .
spectroscopic searches for high - redshift emission - line galaxies have now been shown as a viable technique for improving sensitivity to faint emission line galaxies @xcite . in particular , @xcite have successfully identified three @xmath1 laes with multislit narrowband spectroscopy .
we have presented nicmos observations of these three laes , obtained with the high spatial resolution nic2 camera .
these images confirm the two sources which had only previously been seen in our imacs spectroscopic observations .
furthermore , the @xmath0  data provide some constraints on the properties of these galaxies .
we find that the uv luminosities , star formation rates , equivalent widths and sizes are all consistent with a redshift of @xmath1 .
the two detected sources have @xmath53 within a factor of two of @xmath5 ( as measured by @xcite ) , and equivalent widths are well within the range of values seen at all redshifts .
in addition , the non - detection of msdm 80 + 3 , in combination with a substantial slit - loss of ly@xmath2  flux suggests that the source may be somewhat extended .
these new observations further prove the success of multislit narrowband spectroscopy as a means to uncover faint , high - redshift emission line galaxies .
further efforts for extending this technique to much fainter laes are already underway ( dressler et al . , in prep ) .
longer exposures with the recently upgraded imacs detectors can reach ly@xmath2  luminosities at @xmath10 that have previously only been realized in gravitational lensing surveys along the critical lines of galaxy clusters ( e.g.  @xcite ) . at the limit of our new survey ( at least @xmath54 ) ,
rest - frame equivalent widths above 150    would imply a @xmath55band magnitude fainter than 29- a regime that is currently only accessible from the small area covered by the udf and udf parallels .
these new blind spectroscopic observations will provide an ideal sample of low - luminosity @xmath1 laes that will be detectable with nircam , nirspec , and the tunable filter imager on the _ james webb space telescope _ in modest exposure times ( @xmath56 10,000 seconds ) .
such future observations will provide critical insight into the building blocks of galaxies by measuring their stellar and nebular ( line+continuum ) emission .

 these images confirm the presence of the two sources which were previously only seen in spectroscopic observations . the third source ,

"the investigation of the effective nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interaction in dense hadronic matter is a topic of fundamental importance for nuclear reactions at intermediate energies ( @xmath0 ) and for nuclear structure in general .
the relevant literature is very vast .
reference  @xcite is just a representative example of the traditional microscopic approach where two - nucleon correlations in nuclear systems are introduced through the g - matrix .
moreover , the effective nn interaction is the main ingredient of microscopic predictions of the nuclear equation of state ( eos ) and thus impacts the properties of compact stars .
dense hadronic matter can also be created in the laboratory in energetic heavy - ion ( hi ) collisions .
simulations of hi collisions are typically based on transport equations and describe the evolution of a non - equilibrium system of strongly interacting hadrons undergoing two - body collisions in the presence of a mean field .
the boltzmann - uehling - uhlenbeck equation @xcite and quantum molecular dynamics @xcite , along with their relativistic counterparts @xcite , have been typically employed to describe intermediate - energy hi reactions . _ in - medium _ two - body cross sections are therefore an important component of such simulations .    in direct reactions at intermediate energies the nn cross sections are often used as input to obtain quantum refractive and diffractive effects , replacing the role of optical potentials commonly used in low energy reactions @xcite .
examples such as knockout ( stripping and diffraction dissociation ) reactions , elastic scattering , charge - exchange , and excitation of giant resonances , are often carried out using reaction mechanisms based on the construction of scattering matrices built from the underlying nn scattering .
reaction calculations at intermediate to high energy are often conducted within the framework of the glauber approximation @xcite and have been a frequent tool for testing nuclear models and constraining nuclear sizes .
in fact , the description of complex nuclear reactions at intermediate energies based on individual nn collisions has a long tradition . in the framework of the glauber model ,
the reaction cross section is written in terms of the  thickness function ' , which is the product of the averaged nn cross section and the overlap integral of the target and projectile local densities .    in - medium
nn cross sections have been calculated with a variety of methods . in semi - phenomenological approaches
, one makes the assumption that the transition matrix in the medium is approximately the same as the one in vacuum and that medium effects come in only through the use of effective masses in the phase space factor @xcite .
then , the in - medium cross section is scaled ( relative to its value in vacuum ) as the square of the ratio of the ( reduced ) masses .
phenomenological formulas , such as the one in ref .
@xcite , have been developed for practical purposes and combine the energy dependence of empirical free - space nn cross sections with the density dependence of some microscopic models .
microscopic predictions based on a medium - modified collision matrix were reported , for instance , in ref .
@xcite , where dirac - brueckner - hartree - fock ( dbhf ) medium effects were applied to obtain a medium - modified @xmath1-matrix .
more recent microscopic calculations applied dbhf medium effects to produce a complex g - matrix including consideration of isospin dependence in asymmetric nuclear matter @xcite .
it is the purpose of this paper to present our updated predictions of microscopic in - medium elastic nn cross sections with an improved description of pauli blocking .
the main objective is to produce two - body cross sections which include , microscopically , all important medium effects and are suitable for realistic applications in nucleus - nucleus scattering at intermediate energies including direct and central collisions . as explained in section
ii , we start from a one - boson - exchange nn potential , which describes well the elastic part of the nn interaction up to high energy . thus , as long as we are not interested in pion production , which is negligible up to , at least , several hundreds of mev , it is reasonable to use nn elastic cross sections as input to the reaction model . of course , the elastic part of the nn interaction can and does generate inelastic nucleus - nucleus scattering .    in section
ii , we describe the details of the calculation and highlight the differences with our previous approach .
we then present a selection of results ( section iii ) followed by our conclusions and outlook ( section iv ) .
the starting point of our calculation is a realistic nn interaction which is applied in the nuclear medium without any additional free parameters .
we use relativistic meson theory , which we find to be an appropriate framework to deal with the high momenta encountered in dense matter . in particular
, the one - boson - exchange ( obe ) model has proven very successful in describing nn data in free space and has a good theoretical foundation .
the obe potential is defined as a sum of one - particle - exchange amplitudes of certain bosons with given mass and coupling . in general , six non - strange bosons with masses below 1 gev@xmath2 are used .
thus , @xmath3 with @xmath4 and @xmath5 pseudoscalar , @xmath6 and @xmath7 scalar , and @xmath8 and @xmath9 vector particles
. for more details , see ref .
@xcite . among the many available obe potentials , some being part of the  high - precision generation ' @xcite
, we seek a momentum - space potential developed within a relativistic scattering equation , such as the one obtained through the thompson @xcite three - dimensional reduction of the bethe - salpeter equation @xcite .
first , a self - consistent calculation of ( symmetric or asymmetric ) nuclear matter is performed within the dbhf approach @xcite .
this step yields , along with the eos , the self - consistent nuclear matter potential , which is conveniently parametrized in terms of nucleon effective masses ( see ref .
@xcite for details ) .
then , the thompson equation is solved for two nucleons scattering at some positive energy in the presence of a mean field due to the medium .
the presence of the medium is accounted for through the ( previously calculated ) effective masses ( applied in the two - nucleon propagator and also in the dirac spinors representing the nucleons , consistent with the dbhf philosophy ) and the presence of the ( angle - averaged ) pauli operator to account for pauli blocking of the _ intermediate states_.    in the usual free - space scattering scenario , the two - body cross section is typically represented as a function of the incident laboratory energy , uniquely related to the nucleon momentum in the two - body center - of - mass frame , @xmath10 , through relativistic invariants which yield the well - known relation @xmath11 . in nuclear matter , though , the pauli operator depends also on the total momentum of the two nucleons in the nuclear matter rest frame . for simplicity , in the past
we have used in - vacuum kinematics to define the total momentum of the two - nucleon system ( that is , we assumed that the target nucleon is at rest , on the average ) .
schematically , the effect of pauli principle on intermediate states arises in the g - matrix through the in - medium scattering equation @xcite : @xmath12 with @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 the initial , final , and intermediate relative momenta of the nn pair in their center of mass , and @xmath16 their total momentum .
@xmath17 is the energy of the two - nucleon system in the center - of - mass , and @xmath18 is the same quantity on - shell .    to account for pauli blocking of the _ final state _ , we define the total elastic cross section as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the elastic differential cross section obtained from the g - matrix amplitudes as described above .
@xmath21 is the scattering angle and @xmath22 the fermi momentum .
the presence of the pauli operator in eq .
( [ sigmed ] ) signifies that the integration domain is restricted by @xcite @xmath23 setting @xmath24 in eq .
( [ sigmed ] ) amounts to ignoring pauli blocking of the final state .
( the virtual intermediate states are always subjected to pauli blocking during the g - matrix calculation which produces the amplitudes contained in @xmath25 . )
additional simplifications result from the assumption that the differential cross section is isotropic .
the cross section defined in eq .
( [ sigmed ] ) refers to an idealized scenario where a projectile nucleon , with some momentum above the bottom of the fermi sea , strikes a target nucleon while both embedded in an infinite medium . for application to a realistic nucleus - nucleus scattering scenario , it is best to consider the situation depicted in fig .
[ one ] , where the two fermi spheres represent the local densities of the target and projectile ions .
@xmath26 is the incident momentum ( the momentum of the colliding _ nuclei _ relative to each other ) , whereas @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the momenta of any two _ nucleons_. that is ,
@xmath27 and @xmath29 are the momenta of the two nucleons with respect to the same point .
then , the relative momentum @xmath30 and the total momentum @xmath31 are given by @xmath32 , and @xmath33 , respectively .
the larger circle in the figure is centered at @xmath16 while @xmath34 is the radius of the scattering sphere .
the vector @xmath30 can rotate around the scattering sphere while maintaining constant magnitude due to energy - momentum conservation .
notice that , with the definitions given above , relative momenta which are off the symmetry axis of the two fermi spheres ( the @xmath26 direction ) are allowed , which is not the case with the assumptions made in eq .
( [ sigmed ] ) .
that is , the two interacting nucleons can have momenta in arbitrary directions . in turn , this impacts the solid angle allowed by pauli blocking , as shown below .
( for completeness , we provide a detailed derivation of the allowed solid angle in the next subsection . )    in preparation for the nucleus - nucleus calculation , it is shown in refs .
@xcite that the _ average _ nn cross section ( assuming isotropy of the nn differential cross section ) can be written as @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are smaller @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively , and the angular integrations extend over all possible directions of @xmath27 and @xmath28 allowed by pauli blocking .
often , the empirical free - space nn cross section is used in the integral . in our case
, @xmath40 is the ( microscopic ) nn cross section which contains additional medium effects as described in the previous subsection . @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the volumes of the two ( in general different ) fermi spheres . because of azimuthal asymmetry , eq .
( [ sigav ] ) can be reduced to a fivefold integration .
notice that the  symmetric ' choice @xmath43 @xcite amounts to making the approximations we adopted when writing eq .

finally , for an actual nucleus - nucleus scattering with given @xmath44 , the average cross section given above becomes a function of the laboratory energy , @xmath45 , and the local densities of the colliding nuclei , @xmath46 , and are ready to be used in typical high - energy calculations .
this is usually done by defining the average nucleon - nucleon cross section at the distance of closest approach @xmath47 between the projectile and the target as @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the local density ( at point @xmath50 ) inside nucleus @xmath51 and @xmath52 is the in - medium nn cross section .
the calculation of reaction cross sections in high - energy collisions is best described in the eikonal fomalism .
the  survival amplitudes ' ( or s - matrices ) in the eikonal approximation are given by @xcite @xmath53 \ , \label{eikphase}%\ ] ] where @xmath54 is the fourier transform of the nuclear densities of the projectile and target , and the reaction cross sections are @xmath55 .
\label{sigmar}\ ] ] applications to stable and unstable nuclei using eqs .
( [ avesigeb]-[sigmar ] ) and our new prescription of pauli - blocking effects will be the subject of a future work .
as mentioned in the previous section , the relative momentum @xmath30 and the total momentum @xmath31 are given as @xmath56 , and @xmath57 .
we also define a vector @xmath58 as @xmath59 . assuming that the collision is elastic , conservation of energy and momentum requires @xmath60 the quantities @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the momenta of two nucleons after the collision , whereas @xmath63 is the relative momentum after collision , with @xmath64 . because of the pauli exclusion principle , the following restrictions apply : @xmath65 or , @xmath66    in the equations above , @xmath67 is the angle between @xmath16 and @xmath63 , and @xmath68 the angle between @xmath47 and @xmath63 . as illustrated in fig .
[ two ] , we have @xmath69 with @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the excluded polar angles .
the excluded solid angles for each nucleon are then given by @xmath72 and therefore the total allowed solid angle can be obtained from : @xmath73    where @xmath74 represents the intersection of the two conical sections @xmath75 and @xmath76 .
the full calculation has already been done in ref .
@xcite ; however , in this paper we will use a slightly different approach to calculate @xmath74 .
figure  [ three ] shows how @xmath77 and @xmath78 are projected on the surface of a unit sphere . if @xmath79 is the intersection of @xmath75 and @xmath76 , it is obvious that    @xmath80    the case @xmath81 is more complex than the other three cases and a more detailed study is needed . as shown in fig .
[ four ] , @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the centers of the two circular projections @xmath77 and @xmath78 .
the two circular contours intersect at @xmath84 and @xmath85 .
@xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 are the internal angles of the spherical triangle pbr .
the circular sectors of @xmath77 and @xmath78 have areas equal to @xmath89 and @xmath90 , respectively .
the intersection area of @xmath77 and @xmath78 is given by @xmath91 here , @xmath92 is the area of the spherical triangle pbr . to obtain an expression for @xmath93
, first we define the center of the unit sphere , @xmath94 , as the orgin of the system , and @xmath95 along the @xmath96-axis .
point b is at location @xmath97 , while point l has coordinates @xmath98 .
we can then write : @xmath99 from which @xmath86 can be readily obtained as @xmath100 in a similar fashion we find @xmath87 to be given by @xmath101 applying the law of cosines of spherical trigonometry , @xmath102 we obtain @xmath103 from girard s theorem of spherical trigonometry , we have @xmath104 inserting eq .
( [ eq18 ] ) and eq .
( [ eq19 ] ) into eq .
( [ eq13 ] ) , the solid angle @xmath105 is found to have the following value @xmath106\ } \ ; ,   \label{eq20}\ ] ] where @xmath107 noticing that , while @xmath108 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 have two intersections on the hemisphere , we have @xmath109
we begin by showing in fig .
[ five ] the average in - medium @xmath110 cross section calculated as in eq .
( [ sigav ] ) . on the left
, we display a variety of cases with equal fermi momenta , whereas asymmetric cases are shown on the right .
figure  [ six ] contains the same information for the @xmath111 cross section .
after  overcoming ' complete pauli blocking , the cross section generally rises with increasing incident momentum . in the @xmath111 case ,
we observe , at least at the lower densities , a tendency to reach a broad maximum . in all cases ,
the cross sections become nearly flat at the larger momenta and begin to approach the free space predictions .
figures  [ five]-[six ] are more insightful when compared with fig .
[ seven ] . there
, the @xmath110 and @xmath111 cross sections shown by the dashed blue line are also calculated with eq .
( [ sigav ] ) , but the input nn cross sections in the integrand are evaluated in free space .
thus , comparing the two curves on the left - hand - side ( or on the right , for @xmath111 ) shows the impact of the additional medium effects ( besides those coming from the @xmath112 factor in eq .
( [ sigav ] ) ) originating from the g - matrix calculation and included in @xmath113 in the case of the solid curves .
the impact is noticeable , with the microscopic medium effects further suppressing the cross section and shifting the position of the peak .
we have chosen a particular case ( @xmath114 ) for the purpose of demonstration , but the trend is similar for other densities .
figure  [ eight ] is crucial for the point that we wish to make .
there , for @xmath110 and @xmath111 ( on the left and right , respectively ) , we compare the cross sections calculated from eq .
( [ sigav ] ) to the corresponding ones evaluated with eq .
( [ sigmed ] ) instead .
the predictions from eq .
( [ sigmed ] ) have a sharper rise from zero and a more pronounced peak structure . as is reasonable , differences are large at low momenta , where the scattering is most sensitive to the description of pauli blocking , particularly near the onset of the cross section .
again , we have taken a representative case , but this pattern is common to all densities
. it will be interesting to explore the impact of such differences on reaction cross sections , our next objective .
pauli blocking is perhaps the most important mechanism impacting the collision of two fermions in the medium . it is known to have a substantial effect on the scattering probability , that is , the in - medium cross section .    in this paper , we predict in - medium effective nn cross sections suitable for applications to nucleus - nucleus scattering . the microscopic nn elastic cross sections , modified by all medium effects implied by the dirac - brueckner - hartree - fock theory of nuclear matter , are properly averaged so as to account for all possible directions of the relative momentum of two nucleons in the two colliding fermi spheres .
the more realistic description of the collision geometry amounts to an improved description of pauli blocking as compared to a previous approach @xcite .
we find the effective nn cross sections to be very sensitive to the description of the pauli blocking geometry .
our future plans include the application of these cross sections in glauber reaction calculations with stable and unstable nuclei . in closing
, we also note that in - medium cross sections are related to the mean - free path of a nucleon , a fundamental quantity in the description of a nucleon propagation in nuclear matter .

g 27 , l67 ( 2001 ) ." ," we present updated predictions of effective elastic nucleon - nucleon cross sections intended for use in nucleus - nucleus reactions . 
 a novel characteristic of the present approach combines all microscopic medium effects included in the dirac - brueckner - hartree - fock g - matrix with a pauli blocking mechanism which is more appropriate for applications in ion - ion reaction models as compared to a previous approach . 
 the effective in - medium cross section is found to be quite sensitive to the description of pauli blocking in the final configurations . "
"in the context of classical field theories , topological structures , such as kinks @xcite , vortices @xcite and magnetic monopoles @xcite , are described as static solutions to some nonlinear models . in particular
, such models must allow for the spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism , since topological solutions are formed during a symmetry breaking phase transition . in this sense , topologically non - trivial configurations are of great interesting to physics @xcite , mainly concerning the cosmological consequences they may engender , since such configurations can appear in a rather natural way , during phase transitions in the early universe .    in particular
, vortices are described as rotationally symmetric solutions of a planar abelian - maxwell - higgs model endowed by a fourth - order scalar potential for the matter self - interaction , which also introduces symmetry breaking and nonlinearity . in the usual case
, the maxwell term controls the dynamics of the gauge field , and the covariant derivative squared term controls the dynamics of the scalar field . in such context , vortices are finite - energy solutions of a set of two coupled first - order differential equations , named bogomolnyi - prasad - sommerfield ( bps ) equations @xcite . in this case , the bps vortices are the minimal - energy solutions of the model , and they have interesting applications , mainly concerning the superconductivity phenomena @xcite and the superfluid he@xmath3 .    during the last years , beyond the standard configurations
previously cited , modified ones , also named _
topological k - solutions _ , have been intensively studied .
these solutions arise in a special class of theoretical field models , generically named _
k - theories _ , which are endowed by non - usual kinetic terms .
as expected , such terms change the dynamics of the overall model under investigation .
moreover , it is important to reinforce that the idea of a non - standard dynamics arises in a rather natural way , in the context of string theories .    in general ,
k - theories have been used as effective models mainly in the cosmological scenario . here
, many authors have used the so - called k - essence models @xcite to investigate the present accelerated inflationary phase of the universe @xcite . also , such models can be used to study strong gravitational waves @xcite , dark matter @xcite , tachyon matter n10 and others @xcite .
there are also important motivations concerning the strong interaction physics ; see , for instance , ref .
@xcite .    in this context
, the overall conclusion is that the existence of topological structures is quite sensible to the use of non - standard kinetic terms . here , the more interesting issue is that such structures can exist even as solutions of some theories which do not allow for the spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism @xcite . on the other hand ,
a rather natural way to study such topological solutions is comparing them with their canonical counterparts . in this sense ,
some of us have already investigated topological solutions in the context of k - field models endowed by spontaneous symmetry breaking potentials for the scalar - matter self - interaction , and interesting results can be found , for instance , in ref .
other interesting results concerning k - field models and their classical solutions can be found , for instance , in ref .
@xcite .
another interesting issue concerning topological k - solutions is that they can be either much larger or much smaller than their usual counterparts . in this sense
, k - bosons can mediate either large - range or small - range interactions .
also , important physical quantities , such as energy density and electric and magnetic fields , can exhibit proeminent variations on their tipical profiles , including on their maximum values ; for a detailed treatment of some of such features , see ref .
@xcite .    in the present context
, some k - theories can also support topological solutions with a finite wavelength .
these solutions , generically named _
@xcite , are quite different from the standard topological structures , which interact even if separated by an infinite displacement , since they have an infinite wavelength : two adjacent compactons will interact only if they come into close contact , due to their already explained finite wavelength . in this sense , compactons are most appropriated to describe particle - like configurations than the usual non - compactified topological structures .
so , in this work we present new results concerning the topological solutions of an abelian - maxwell - higgs model endowed by non - usual kinetic terms to both gauge and scalar fields . here ,
the non - standard dynamics are introduced by two positive functions , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , which couple with the maxwell term and with the covariant derivative squared term , respectively .
the euler - lagrange equations of motion of such theory are hard to solve , then we focus our attention only on the finite - energy solutions of the bps equations of the model . these equations can be obtained by minimizing the energy functional of the model , which can be done via an important constraint between @xmath4 , @xmath6 and the scalar potential @xmath7 for the matter self - interaction ; see eqs . and below . in this case , rotationally symmetric bps vortices are described as the minimal - energy solutions of the cited model , and they engender interesting features , as explained below .
this paper is outlined as follows : in the next sec.[general ] , we introduce the model and develop the theoretical framework which allows us to get to its bogomolnyi - prasad - sommerfield equations . in sec.[numerical ] , we prove the consistence of the theoretical framework previously developed by using it to investigate the existence of new bps  states . here , we note that such states are constrained to the choices made for @xmath8 and @xmath5 : for any acceptable pair of such functions , there is a corresponding bpsconfiguration .
also in sec.[numerical ] , we show how to use the theoretical framework presented in this work to recover the recover the bpsresults concerning the standard maxwell - higgs model . in section numerical2
, we perform the numerical analysis concerning the new bpsstates previously presented , we depict the corresponding minimal - energy modified solutions and comment on their main features . finally , in sec.end , we present our conclusions and perspectives .    from now on ,
we use standard conventions , including natural units system , and a plus - minus signature for the planar minkowski metric : diag@xmath9 .
in this section , we introduce the model .
it is described by the @xmath10-dimensional lagrange density@xmath11here , @xmath12 is the usual faraday field strength tensor , @xmath13 is the covariant derivative and @xmath7 is the spontaneous symmetry breaking potential . also , @xmath4 is the `` dieletric function '' , and @xmath14 stands for the non - standard kinetic matter term . both @xmath4 and @xmath1 are dimensionless functions to be given below , as functions of the amplitude of the scalar field .    in the case of vortices , it is convenient to deal with dimensionless variables .
so , for simplicity , we introduce the mass scale @xmath15 , and use it to implement the scale transformations : @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , where @xmath21 stands for the symmetry breaking parameter of the model . in this case , we get @xmath22 , with @xmath23 being the dimensionless lagrange density to be used from now on , which has the same functional form of @xmath24 . moreover , we omit the coupling constant related to the scalar matter self - interaction . also , we take @xmath25 and @xmath21 as real and positive parameters .    to search for vortex solutions ,
the canonical procedure is to deal with the euler - lagrange equations of the model . in the present case ,
these equations are@xmath26and@xmath27here , we take @xmath28 and@xmath29as the modified 4-current vector .    the gauss law for time - independent fields can be written as@xmath30where @xmath31 .
we note that the eq .   is trivially verified by @xmath32 .
so , we fix this gauge and use it from now on .
we look for vortex solutions of the form@xmath33@xmath34here , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are polar coordinates , and @xmath37 is the winding number ( vorticity ) of the solution . in terms of and ,
the euler - lagrange equations and can be rewritten as@xmath38@xmath39equations and are the euler - lagrange equations of motion to the profile functions @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively .    to solve and
, we need to specify the model . in general , we can do it by choosing non - trivial forms to @xmath42 and @xmath43 . in this case
, we have to keep in mind that both these functions must be positive , in order to avoid problems with the energy of the model ; see the expression for the energy density below .
also , we need to choose a higgs potential @xmath44 which allows for the spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism .    before that
, we note that the limit @xmath45 leads us back to the model studied in @xcite , which is supported by applications concerning the interaction between quarks and gluons @xcite . in this case , the limit @xmath46 leads us back to the usual maxwell - higgs theory . in this context , if we choose the symmetry breaking higgs potential@xmath47the euler - lagrange equations and can then be rewritten as@xmath48@xmath49according to our conventions , eqs . and are completely solvable by the first order differential equations@xmath50@xmath51    the solutions of eqs . and are the bogomolnyi - prasad - sommerfield ( bps ) states of the standard maxwell - higgs model .
these solutions are the well - known abrikosov - nielsen - olesen ( ano ) ones @xcite , which solve the equations of motion and by minimazing the energy of the resulting vortex configurations .    in general , for non - trivial choices to @xmath42 and @xmath52 , the equations of motion and
will be much more sofisticated than the eqs . and .
so , in order to get an useful insight about the non - trivial case , we consider the expression for the energy density of the modified vortex solutions:@xmath53from eq .
, we note that the presence of non - trivial @xmath54 and @xmath43 makes it hard to obtain the bps states of the modified model . even in this case , the existence of such states is still possible , and it is closely related to an important constraint between @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44:@xmath55as we clarify below , for any positive choices to @xmath42 and @xmath43 , there is a corresponding symmetry breaking higgs potential @xmath44 as a solution of . in this context
, generalized first order equations can be found by minimizing the energy functional .    to search for bps  vortex solutions in the modified model
, we need to know how the functions @xmath41 and @xmath40 behave , near the origin and asymptotically . near the origin
, these functions must avoid singular fields .
so , they have to behave according to@xmath56where we have fixed @xmath57 , for simplicity .
also , the symmetry breaking vortex configurations must have a finite total energy .
so , as a condition to make the energy finite , the energy density must vanish .
then , asymptotically , @xmath41 and @xmath40 have to obey@xmath58    in the next sec .
iii , we use the theoretical framework developed in this section to investigate the existence of bps states in the generalized model . also
, we present and comment the resulting numerical solutions .
finally , we show how to map the standard maxwell - higgs and chern - simons - higgs first order equations ; even in these cases , eq .
leads us to a physically different rotationally symmetric solutions .
we now pay due attention to the modified bps states themselves . here , we choose positive functional forms to @xmath42 and @xmath52 .
then , we solve the constraint to get to the consistent higgs potential @xmath44 , which must allow for the spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism .
a posteriori , we use these conventions to obtain the first order differential equations of the modified model , by minimizing its energy functional .
then , in the next sec.iv , we numerically solve these equations , according to the boundary conditions and . finally , in sec.v
, we comment the main features of the resulting solutions .
the model to be studied here has two unusual functions , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , which we have to fix to determine how they affect the vortex solutions .
the function @xmath42 stands for a `` dieletric function '' , and it controls the non - standard kinetic term to the gauge field . on the other hand , the function @xmath43 controls the non - usual kinetic scalar matter term .
both these functions are dimensionless , and are functions of the amplitude of the scalar field .
also , they must be positive , in order to avoid problems with the energy of the model ; see eq .  .
a rather natural way to investigate the consistence of the theoretical framework developed in the previous sec .
ii is to study the bps states of the standard maxwell - higgs model , which is defined by @xmath59 . in this case , eq .
leads us to the potential .
then , the energy density can be rewritten as@xmath60the resulting total energy @xmath61 is minimized by the first order equations and . in this context , the energy of the bps states is@xmath62as usual , this is the lower bound of the energy functional , i.e. , the bogomolnyi bound .
also , it is quantized according to the winding number @xmath63 .
now , we introduce an interesting new model , which is defined by@xmath64according to these choices , we solve to get to the potential@xmath65which allows for the spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism , as desired .
we point out that this new model is not a parametrization of the standard maxwell - higgs one , since the vacuum manifold of the two models are quite different : it is a circle for the usual model , while it is a dot surrounded by a circle for the new model .    using eqs . and
, the energy density can then be rewritten as@xmath66then , the corresponding energy functional is minimized by the equations@xmath67@xmath68we note that the modified equations and can not be parametrized into the standard ones , i.e. , eqs . and . even in this case , the energy of the modified field solutions is bounded from below , and the bogomolnyi bound is@xmath69here , as in the standard case , the total energy of the bps states is quantized ; see eq .  .
in order to reinfoce the consistence of the theoretical framework presented in this work , we introduce another modified model .
it is defined by@xmath70according to these conventions , eq
.   leads us to the standard higgs potential .
so , the modified model has the same vacuum structure as the usual model . even in this context ,
the new model is not a parametrization of the standard one ; see the bps  eqs . and below .
the modified energy density can be written in the form@xmath71and the resulting energy functional is minimized by the first order equations@xmath72@xmath73then , the bogolmolnyi bound is also given by , and we conclude that the modified solutions and have the same energy of the standard and ones .    to end this section , we show how to use the theoretical framework developed in this work to map the standard maxwell- and chern - simons - higgs first order differential equations .
we do it by reviewing the model studied in @xcite , which is defined by @xmath74 . in this case , as presented in that work , an interesting choice to the dieletric function is@xmath75here , @xmath76 is a real auxiliary parameter which controls the model , and @xmath77 stands for the coupling constant corresponding to the chern - simons term . in the limit @xmath78 , eq .
gives @xmath79 , and reproduces the standard maxwell - higgs system .
on the other hand , the limit @xmath80 gives@xmath81we then solve eq .
to get@xmath82which is exactly the sixth - order symmetry breaking higgs potential one finds in the usual self - dual chern - simons - higgs model .
now , from eqs . and , the energy density can be written in the form@xmath83the resulting total energy is minimized by the differential equations@xmath84@xmath85and the bogomolnyi bound is @xmath86 .
the equations and are just the bps  ones for the standard chern - simons - higgs system . in this sense , eq .   works as a unified way to map both the maxwell- and the chern - simons - higgs first order differential equations .
finally , we point out that , despite the possibility of reproducing such chern - simons equations , the unified picture leads us to a physically different situation , since the modified model we consider here only supports non - charged field solutions ; see the gauss law above . in this case , the modified nontopological field solutions are unstable , and they can decay into the elementary mesons of the model .
this fact makes an important difference , since the nontopological configurations presented by the self - dual chern - simons - higgs theory are stable , and can not decay .    in the next section
, we present the modified first order  numerical solutions for the profile funtions @xmath41 and @xmath87 . also , we comment on the main features of such solutions .
let us focus attention on the modified numerical solutions themselves .
the equations to be solved are the first order ones and , and and .
also , we solve the standard equations and , for comparison . in all cases , the functions @xmath41 and
@xmath40 must obey the boundary conditions and .    in the present work ,
the numerical strategy to be employed is the relaxation one . in this case , it is necessary to input an approximated field solution .
then , our algorithm will `` relax '' it into the correct one . to start the numerical analysis
, we consider a variation of the standard maxwell - higgs model , in which the potential for the self - interaction for the scalar field is not present .
then , we use its solutions to solve the self - dual maxwell - higgs case , i.e. , the equations and , from which we get the well - understood abrikosov - nielsen - olesen ( ano ) configurations .
we then use these solutions to initialize the numerical study of the modified theory .
starting from such ano configurations , we numerically solve the modified bps equations presented in the previous section , i.e. , eqs . and , and also eqs . and , for @xmath88
the solutions for the profile functions @xmath41 and @xmath40 are plotted in figs . 1 and 2 , respectively . also ,
we depict the solutions for the corresponding energy densities ; see figure 3 .     for the models ( dash - dotted red line ) and ( dashed blue line ) .
the standard solution is also depicted ( solid black line ) , for comparison.,width=321 ]    in figure 1 , we present the solutions for the profile function @xmath89 , and we see that both the modified profiles reach their vacuum values more slowly than their canonical counterpart . in this sense ,
such solutions have a core which is greater than the usual maxwell - higgs one . here , the conclusion is that , in general , the introduction of a non - canonical dynamics allows for the existence of self - dual field solutions @xmath41 with a increased characteristic length . also , we note that the solution for and goes to its vacuum configuration more slowly than that for and .
so , beyond the fact of increasing the core of the solutions , we note that increases it more than the .
we believe that this fact is related with the corresponding self - dual higgs potential , which is of sixth - order for the model , and of fourth - order for the one ; see equations and above .    .
conventions as in fig .
1.,width=321 ]    in fig .
2 , we depict the numerical solutions for the function @xmath90 . here , as in the fig . 1 , we note that the modified solutions go to their vacuum states more slowly than the standard maxwell - higgs profile , and so such solutions have a increased characteristic length .
this behaviour reinforces the previous conclusion , which states that a non - standard dynamics leads to a self - dual field solutions with a increased core .
we also see that , beyond the fact of increasing the core of @xmath40 , the model enlarges it more than the .
finally , we point out the existence of a proeminent plateau in the profile related to , near the origin : such structure is also present in the self - dual chern - simons - higgs case , which is governed by the potential . in this context
, it is interesting to note that the existence of such proeminent plateau seems to be closely related to the vacuum manifold of a sixth - order symmetry breaking potential , since it is also present in the modified model , which is governed by .    the fig .
3 encloses the solutions for the energy densities of the new bps states ; see equations and .
we see that the profile for the energy density corresponding to the modified model is quite different from that of the standard maxwell - higgs theory : in the canonical case , the energy density reaches its maximum value in the limit @xmath91 , and it is monotonically decrescent for all @xmath35 . on the other hand , in the modified case , the energy density reaches its maximum value at some finite distance @xmath92 from the origin , and it is not monotonically decrescent for all values of the independent variable . in this context , this difference reinforces our previous conclusion , since such modified behaviour mimics the one of the energy density of the usual self - dual chern - simons theory .    .
conventions as in fig .
1.,width=321 ]    the solution for the bps energy density of the modified model is also depicted in figure 3 , and we see that its behaviour is qualitatively similar to that of the maxwell - higgs model : it reaches its maximum value as @xmath35 goes to @xmath93 , and it is monotonically decrescent for all @xmath35 . here , however , there are two important differences : the first one is on the maximum value of the modified profile itself , which is smaller than the usual one , and the second one is on the characteristic length of the non - standard solution , which is greater than its canonical counterpart .
an important issue concerning the study of topological structures is the computation of their topological charges , which must be conserved . in the present case , i.e. , for electrically non - charged field solutions of the form and , this charge is related to the magnetic field generated by such solutions themselves . to investigate this issue
, we introduce the topological current@xmath94which is clearly conserved . here , @xmath95 .
the 0@xmath96-component of such current , that is , the topological charge density , can be written as@xmath97and we see that it is directly proportional to the magnetic field @xmath98 . in this case , the topological charge is given by@xmath99here , @xmath100  stands for the flux of the magnetic field .    according , and ,
the magnetic flux @xmath101  can be rewritten in the form@xmath102and we note that the topological charge @xmath103 is conserved , and it is quantized according to the winding number @xmath63 .    in this sense , to better specify the field configurations studied in this work , a rather natural way is to consider their corresponding magnetic fields .
in the present context , this field is given by@xmath104    the modified numerical profiles for the magnetic field are plotted in figure 4 . also for such field , the non - usual dynamics introduced earlier leads to bps solutions with a increased core , since the modified profiles have a characteristic length which is greater than the standard one . in this case , as for the energy densities previously depicted , the magnetic field associated to is quite different from the canonical self - dual one , which reaches its maximum value for @xmath91 , and is monotonically decrescent ever : the non - standard solution reaches its maximum value at some finite distance from the origin , and it is not monotonically decrescent for all @xmath35 .
such behaviour is similar to that of the self - dual magnetic field related to the canonical chern - simons - higgs model .    .
conventions as in fig .
1.,width=321 ]    to end this section , we discuss the solution for the magnetic field related to the model .
this solution is also depicted in fig .
4 , from which we note that the behaviour of such magnetic field is quite similar to that of the usual maxwell - higgs case , since it reaches its maximum value as @xmath91 , and it is monotonically decrescent ever . here
, we point out the behaviour of the modified solution , which assures the conservation of the topological charge ; see eqs . and .
in the present letter , we have considered the existence of rotationally symmetric bps solutions in a @xmath105-dimensional space - time .
we have investigated such solutions in a modified self - dual maxwell - higgs model endowed by a non - standard dynamics . here , the modification was introduced in terms of two non - trivial functions , @xmath106 and @xmath5 , which must be positive , in order to avoid problems with the energy density of the model .
so , while @xmath4 couples with the maxwell term and , as a consequence , changes the dynamics of the gauge field in a non - usual way , @xmath107 couples with the squared covariant derivative of the non - charged scalar field , then leading to a non - standard dynamics to such field . in this context , consistent first order equations were obtained since the non - trivial functions @xmath4 and @xmath5 are constrained to the symmetry breaking higgs potential @xmath108 of the modified model ; see eq .  .
we have integrated the bps equations by means of the relaxation method , and the numerical results we found are depicted in figs . 1 and 2 , for some interesting choices to the functions @xmath106 and @xmath5 ; see eqs . and .
according these solutions , we conclude that both the profile functions @xmath41 and @xmath40 are quite sensible to the choices made for @xmath106 and @xmath5 .
in particular , it is important to reinforce that each of the models and is related to a very specific symmetry breaking potential @xmath2 and , as a consequence , such models present distinct vacuum manifolds ; for details , see eqs . and .    also , using the previous results we found for @xmath41 and @xmath40 , we have integrated both the energy density @xmath109 and the magnetic field @xmath110 for the modified models and , and these solutions are depicted in figs . 3 and 4 , respectively
; see eqs . , and .
the numerical analysis reveals that the solutions corresponding the model behave as those predicted by the chern - simons - higgs theory , which reach their maximum values at some finite distance from the origin , and are not monotonically decrescent for all @xmath35 . on the other hand ,
the solutions corresponding the model behave as the maxwell - higgs ones , since they reach their maximum values as @xmath91 , and are monotonically decrescent for all values of the independent variable .
so , as a consequence , we conclude that also the energy density @xmath111 and the magnetic field @xmath110 are both sensible to the choices made for @xmath106 and @xmath5 .
we hope that this work may stimulate subsequent analysis in the field , concerning mainly the features that the modified solutions engender .
also , we point out that the variation on the characteristic length of the modified solutions presented here is closely related to the effects of anisotropy , which is a feature tipically present in the effective field models used to describe the behaviour engendered by low - energy condensed matter systems . in this sense
, we point out that such effective models are usually based on the lorentz - breaking ideia , since it introduces the issue of anisotropy explicity . in the context of lorentz - violating models , such effects where already studied by some of us ; see , for instance , ref .
@xcite .    a very interesting issue concerns the use of modified models to mimic the very same solutions engendered by the standard maxwell - higgs theory . in particular , such issue is now under consideration , and we hope to report new results in a near future .

e. da hora and c. m. cantanhede , in preparation ." ," we look for topological bps solutions of an abelian - maxwell - higgs theory endowed by non - standard kinetic terms to both gauge and scalar fields . here , the non - usual dynamics are controlled by two positive functions , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , which are related to the self - dual scalar potential @xmath2 of the model by a fundamental constraint . 
 the numerical results we found present interesting new features , and contribute to the development of the recent issue concerning the study of generalized models and their applications . "
"since the discovery of copper oxide based high temperature superconductors ( htsc ) @xcite , which are of the extreme type - ii variety , there has been great interest in their phenomenological phase diagrams .
abrikosov s mean - field description@xcite , which is valid for conventional low temperature superconductors , is expected to be modified by the strong thermal fluctuations in htsc .
extensive research in both theory , numerical simulations , and experiments over the years have resulted in a general consensus on some of the fundamental issues .
the current understanding of htsc in a uniform magnetic field @xmath1 is as follows . in the absence of any pinning disorder
, the low temperature abrikosov vortex lattice phase melts into a vortex liquid via a first order transition at the temperature @xmath2 .
the abrikosov vortex lattice phase is characterized by a transverse triangular crystalline order and a finite longitudinal phase coherence .    however , recently there has been some debate about the nature of the vortex liquid which the abrikosov vortex lattice melts into as temperature increases .
numerous simulations using the 3dxy model @xcite , london@xcite and lowest landau level approximations@xcite have indicated that the vortex liquid is _ incoherent _ , i.e. the phase coherence or superfluid density in any direction , is zero .
the crystalline order and phase coherence are destroyed simultaneously at the melting transition .
this scenario has been supported by experiments on high quality ybco crystals@xcite .
other simulations using the 3dxy model @xcite have suggested that the longitudinal phase coherence persists above the melting transition and only vanishes at a higher `` entanglement '' temperature @xmath3 . in this scenario ,
the vortex liquid at @xmath4 would be disentangled with relatively straight vortex lines . for @xmath5 , it was claimed that larger thermal fluctuations causes the vortex lines to be entangled with a concomitant loss of global phase coherence@xcite .
previously , a vortex liquid with nonzero longitudinal phase - coherence , or superfluid density , was found in simulations on an isotropic system@xcite .
more recently @xcite , it has been proposed that for large @xmath6 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 merge into a single transition whereas for small @xmath1 they are well separated .
the authors found that for an isotropic system , the crossover between the two regimes is at a filling fraction @xmath7 , where the precise definition of @xmath8 will be given shortly .
however , these simulations were performed on rather small systems . in the present work ,
we have performed similar simulations on a much larger system , and found an exclusively incoherent vortex liquid down to @xmath9 .
this implies that the only thermodynamically stable vortex liquid phase , is one which has zero longitudinal superfluid density , with full translational and rotational symmetries and zero phase coherence in all directions .
we are therefore led to the conclusion that the recently discussed @xcite crossover between the phase - coherent vortex liquid and the phase - incoherent vortex liquid is a numerical artifact .
the organization of this paper is as follows . in section
ii we first briefly review the model used in the simulations , and the quantities we calculate . in section iii
we discuss our results and their implications . in section
iv we provide a summary and conclusion .
we use a uniformly frustrated 3dxy model on a cubic lattice to describe an isotropic , extreme type - ii superconductors in a magnetic field . the london model for superconductors
can be readily derived from the phenomenological ginzburg - landau ( gl ) model with the approximation that the amplitude of the local complex order parameter @xmath10 $ ] , is fixed .
the hamiltonian @xmath11 of the london model consists of degrees of freedom in the phase @xmath12 and the gauge vector potential @xmath13 associated with the magnetic induction @xmath1 inside the system , i.e. @xmath14 $ ] .    for an isotropic extreme type - ii superconductor ,
the penetration depth @xmath15 is much larger than the coherence length @xmath16 such that the gl parameter @xmath17 .
this means that the magnetic fields surrounding the vortex lines strongly overlap with one another giving a spatially smooth @xmath1 .
this condition is ensured in the regime where @xmath18 . in other words ,
the fluctuations of @xmath13 on the length scale of @xmath16 are negligible compared to the fluctuations of @xmath12 .
therefore , we can further simplify the problem by dropping the degrees of freedom of @xmath13 from the hamiltonian @xmath11 , and fix @xmath6 equal to the external applied magnetic field .
the resulting hamiltonian @xmath19 $ ] is the 3dxy model .
this @xmath20 ( or frozen gauge ) approximation has been widely used as a phenomenological model for superconductors . note that , within this model , the system has no _ magnetic flux lines _ , since there can be no tubes of confined magnetic flux when @xmath21 .
the system only exhibits _
vortex lines_.    in order to perform numerical simulations on the resulting model , we discretize the model on a 3d cubic lattice with grid spacing @xmath16 . the dimensionless hamiltonian of this lattice model is given by @xcite h[\{()}]=- j_0 _ , = x , y , z ( j _ ) [ eqn_hamiltonian ] where @xmath22 is the isotropic coupling energy , @xmath23 is the flux quanta and @xmath24 is the permeability of a vacuum in si units . the dimensionless vector @xmath25 labels the position of an arbitrary grid point .
we define the gauge - invariant phase difference @xmath26 as j _
( ) ( + * e*_)- ( ) -^+*e * _ _ d_vp( ) [ eqn_current ] where @xmath27 is the unit vector along the @xmath28-axis .
the convention is that @xmath26 `` flows '' from the grid at @xmath25 to @xmath29 . in this model
, it is natural to define a dimensionless temperature @xmath30 .
the magnetic induction @xmath1 is conveniently represented by the filling fraction f=. [ eqn_filling_fraction ]    in this paper , we perform a monte carlo simulation on an isotropic system with @xmath31 number of grid points .
the aim of our numerical simulations is to identify possible thermodynamic phases ( i.e. vortex lattice or liquid , etc . ) and phase transitions ( first order or continuous ) or crossovers associated with them . specifically , we are interested in calculating the internal energy , specific heat , structure factor , and helicity moduli . these thermodynamic quantities and their physical significance
will be discussed next .
in addition , we introduce and define a quantity @xmath32 which we denote the vortex - path probability , and discuss some of its physical implications .    a first order transition is indicated by a @xmath33-function anomaly in the specific heat , equivalently a discontinuous jump in the internal energy .
on the other hand , the hallmark of a continuous transition is a jump in the specific heat , modified by fluctuation contributions to the anomaly , and a continuous internal energy .
the internal energy per site is obtained by averaging @xmath11 in over the thermal equilibrium states , normalized by the total number of grids , i.e. @xmath34 .
we define a dimensionless specific heat per site @xmath35 using the standard fluctuation theorem of a classical system with gibbs distribution@xcite : c= [ eqn_specific_heat ]    a convenient and widely used quantity to probe the _ global _ phase coherence of the system is the helicity modulus , which is proportional to the second derivative of the free energy associated with with respect to an infinitesimal phase twist@xcite . on a square lattice
, the dimensionless helicity modulus @xmath36 can be written as _ = .
[ eqn_helicity_modulus ] @xmath36 measures the `` stiffness '' of @xmath37 with respect to twisting along the @xmath28-direction .
if @xmath38 then @xmath37 is stiff in the @xmath28-direction , or more precisely , there is _ global _ phase coherence or superconducting response in that direction . by tracking the temperature at which @xmath39 goes to zero
, one can determine the superconducting - normal metal transition temperature of the system .
in the mixed phase @xmath40 and @xmath41 , where the subscripts @xmath42 and @xmath43 denote the directions longitudinal and transverse to @xmath1 , respectively .
the structure factor probes the transverse crystalline order of the vortex system .
we adopt a conventional definition @xcite : s(_)= where @xmath44 is a two - dimensional reciprocal vector and @xmath45 is the local vorticity measured on the dual square lattice grid @xcite , composed of the centers of every direct unit cell .
a crystalline ordered phase is characterized by @xmath46 ( or bragg peaks ) where @xmath47 are the _ discrete _ set of reciprocal lattice vectors associated with the crystal structure .
on the other hand , @xmath48 for a phase with full rotational invariance exhibits ring patterns .    at a fixed temperature ,
the equilibrium configurations are generated by making random changes to @xmath12 at each grid - point via the the metropolis algorithm .
this is equivalent to randomly changing all the six @xmath49 attached to each grid - point . to ensure conservation of vorticity in each unit cell
, @xmath49 has to be in the range @xmath50 .
addition of @xmath51 shall be administrated to bring @xmath49 back into range at every monte carlo step .
_ this procedure introduces vortex - loops into the system .
such loops are the elementary topological excitation of the model_. periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) are imposed on @xmath49 such that @xmath52 for @xmath53 .
more details about the monte carlo procedure may be found in refs ..    we define @xmath32 as the probability of finding a directed vortex path threading the entire system transverse to the induction @xmath6 , _ without using the pbc along the field direction _ @xcite .
it is obtained by computing the number @xmath54 of times we find _ at least one _ such path threading the system in any direction @xmath55 in @xmath56 different phase - configurations , normalized by @xmath57 , i.e. @xmath58 . the fact that @xmath59 implies that there is no connected path of vortex segments that threads the entire system in the transverse direction , without using pbc along the field direction several times . now , let @xmath60 ( @xmath61 $ ] ) denote the areal density of connected vortex paths threading the system in any direction , including the direction parallel to the induction .
it is clear that in the abrikosov vortex lattice phase @xmath59 , and @xmath62 , while @xmath63 .
thus , @xmath64 is a conserved quantity at fixed induction @xmath6 . on the other hand
, @xmath65 implies that @xmath66 , and the _ total _ number of vortex paths threading the system in any direction scales with system size , but undergoes thermal fluctuations .
therefore , @xmath64 is no longer a conserved quantity .
we propose the following scenario to interpret the change in @xmath32 and @xmath64 .
number conservation uniquely identifies a @xmath67-symmetry , and hence the low - temperature phase of the _ vortex_-system ( the dual of the phase - representation of the superconductor ) exhibits explicit @xmath67-symmetry , since @xmath59 . at high temperatures @xmath65
, @xmath60 is not conserved , and the @xmath67-symmetry is broken .
a @xmath67-symmetric phase can not be analytically continued to a @xmath67-nonsymmetric one .
the change in @xmath32 from @xmath68 to @xmath69 could therefore signal a phase - transition , in this case involving breaking a global @xmath67-symmetry , in finite as well as zero magnetic field .
however , to substantiate such a claim , one needs to argue that @xmath32 is related to a local order parameter of the system . to this end
, we note that it is possible to transcribe the _ vortex - part _ of the ginzburg - landay theory in the phase - only approximation in such a way that the vortex - part of the theory is specified in terms of a local , complex matter field @xmath70 , and that the theory then _ explicitly _ exhibits a @xmath67-symmetry @xcite . in the lattice london model ,
corresponding to the villain - approximation to the ginzburg - landau theory , this symmetry is therefore only _ implicit _ , or  hidden ' . the probability of finding a connected vortex - path starting at a point @xmath71 and ending at point @xmath72 , @xmath73 , is given in terms of the two - point correlation function of the matter field @xmath74 , @xmath75 @xcite .
@xmath32 may be viewed as a special case of @xmath76 , and in the thermodynamic limit corresponds to @xmath77 .
if @xmath78 is non - zero in this limit , this _ suggests _ the possibility of having @xmath79 , and hence a broken @xmath67-symmetry .
although this does not constitute a proof that @xmath32 is connected to a local order parameter whose expectation value is associated with a broken @xmath67-symmetry , it seems to be suggestive of such a phase - transition existing even at finite magnetic field .
note that the above local matter field @xmath80 appears to be the dual field of a complex order parameter appearing in a somewhat different independent approach to the same problem by teanovi @xcite .
in this section , we discuss the results of our simulations on an isotropic system with size of @xmath81 grid points , which is the largest to date on an isotropic system .
the system is subdivided into multiple sections , and the monte carlo procedure is implemented in parallel across the sections using 3d `` black and white '' decomposition@xcite .
the filling fraction considered are @xmath82 , and @xmath83 .
the system is cooled from high temperatures .
for each temperature , a typical run consists of 120000 monte carlo sweeps across the whole lattice , @xmath84 of that were used for equilibration .
near phase - transitions , up to 600000 sweeps were used .    in , we present the results for the zero - field case , @xmath85 , where we show the specific heat @xmath35 , the superfluid stiffness @xmath39 , and the vortex - path probability @xmath32 as functions of temperature .
note how the specific heat anomaly , the vanishing of the superfluid stiffness and @xmath32 , all coincide with @xmath86 .
the physical interpretation of @xmath65 is that the effective long - wavelength vortex - line tension vanishes @xcite .
this claim is substantiated by calculating the probability distribution @xmath87 of vortex loops as a function of perimeter @xmath88 , at various temperatures .
we may fit this distribution to the form @xcite @xmath89 where @xmath90 is an effective , _ temperature dependent _ , long - wavelength line tension , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 .
the results are shown in , demonstrating that at @xmath93 , a purely algebraic decay is realized , implying @xmath94 .
below @xmath95 , the exponential decay is well fitted , showing that @xmath96 .
the inset of shows @xmath90 as a function of temperature , as obtained in our simulations
. a similar method of extracting @xmath90 for the zero - field case using a similar form for @xmath87 ( without he power - law prefactor ) has previously been used by li and teitel , in ref . .
the results for the quantities @xmath48 , @xmath39 and @xmath35 for @xmath97 are shown in .
similar qualitative features are also found for the cases @xmath98 .
first , @xmath99 exhibits six - fold bragg peaks at low temperatures ( not shown ) .
this indicates that the low temperature phase is a triangular vortex lattice phase .
the destruction of the vortex lattice structure is marked by a melting transition at @xmath100 where @xmath101 drops sharply to zero , where @xmath102 is the wavevector of one of the six first order bragg peaks .
the sharpness of the drop in @xmath101 strongly suggests that the transition is first order .
this is confirmed by the appearance of a @xmath33-function like peak in @xmath35 at the same temperature @xmath103 .
coincidentally , @xmath104 which is finite at low temperatures , also drops sharply to zero at @xmath103 . _
the isotropic system exhibits longitudinal superconductivity below @xmath103 , but not above_. moreover , based on our above discussion in section ii , we interpret the rise in the quantity @xmath32 from @xmath68 to @xmath69 as signalling that the effective long - wavelength vortex - line tension vanishes .
thus , the vortex liquid phase is divided into two regions in phase - space . in one region ,
the vortex liquid is phase - incoherent i.e. has no longitudinal superfluid density but has finite vortex - line tension .
we _ propose _ that this phase exhibits a vortex - associated @xmath67-symmetry . in the other region
the vortex liquid is phase - incoherent but has zero vortex - line tension .
we propose that this phase exhibits a broken @xmath67-symmetry .
based on this , one can conclude that a first order melting transition of the abrikosov vortex lattice exists in an _ isotropic _ system in the absence of pinning .
the entire vortex liquid phase is _ incoherent _ , i.e. a vortex liquid phase with no longitudinal superconductivity .
note that the same conclusion has been reached in earlier simulations on _ anisotropic _ systems@xcite .
there have been earlier reports of a disentangled vortex liquid , i.e. vortex liquid with non - zero longitudinal phase coherence .
these results have been obtained in similar simulation@xcite . in ref . , it was argued that a phase - coherent vortex liquid should be most easily observed in isotropic systems for @xmath105 .
however , these simulations were performed on comparatively small systems , typically of sizes no larger than @xmath106 .
our present results are based on much larger systems , @xmath81 .
we have observed a slight difference in the temperatures at which @xmath48 and @xmath104 vanish in simulations on smaller system or lower number of sweeps .
therefore , it may be concluded that the existence of a vortex liquid with a nonzero longitudinal superfluid density is a numerical artifact of small system sizes and/or insufficient simulation time @xcite .
it is well understood that the @xmath15-transition is driven by proliferation of thermally excited loops of all sizes . in recent work by some of us
, it was proposed that the same mechanism is driving the first order melting transition at low @xmath6 and a newly discovered continuous transition involving the breaking of u(1 ) symmetry at large @xmath6@xcite .
similar results for @xmath107 and @xmath108 enable us to propose a simple phase diagram for an isotropic extreme type - ii superconductor in the absence of disorder ( see ) . immediately below and above the @xmath103 line , the phases of the vortex system are identified as the abrikosov vortex lattice and the incoherent vortex liquid , respectively .    in a pin - free system
, one would expect @xmath109 to be zero at all temperature . in this case , the numerical lattice , on which simulations are performed , effectively pins the vortex lines from moving in the transverse plane and counteracts the lorentz forces on them in the presence of a transverse applied current .
however , the pinning is overcome by thermal fluctuations at higher temperature and the vortex lines are depinned at temperature @xmath110 .
fortunately , we see that @xmath111 , which means that near @xmath103 , the vortex lines , and the melting process , are completely free from the effects of the numerical grid
. therefore , the features of @xmath35 , @xmath104 and @xmath48 at @xmath103 are genuine thermodynamic effects .
we have performed simulations of the uniformly frustrated 3dxy model on a large _ isotropic _ system ( @xmath81 grid points ) for a variety of filling fractions @xmath82 and @xmath83 .
we found a first order melting transition in this isotropic system for all the three non - zero values of @xmath112 considered .
the longitudinal phase coherence and triangular crystalline order of the abrikosov vortex crystal are simultaneously destroyed at the melting transition . above the melting temperature , the incoherent vortex liquid is the only thermodynamic phase .
we have demonstrated that previous claims of the existence of disentangled vortex liquid@xcite is due to performing simulations using insufficient system sizes and simulation times .
we have shown that the effective vortex - line tension vanishes precisely at the zero - field superconducting transition .
the loss of superfluid stiffness , the loss of line tension , and the abrupt change in the connectivity of the vortex tangle , as signalled by the change in the quantitity @xmath32 across the system , all coincide in this case .
a similar change in connectivity across the vortex system takes place at finite magnetic field .
the results of the ref . , the present paper , and in particular those of ref . strongly indicate that this change in connectivity is sharp in the limit of large systems , thus indicating the loss of number - conservation of connected vortex paths threading the system .
since the finite probability of finding a connected vortex path threading the system in a direction other than the magnetic field may be tied to the finite expectation value of a local complex matter field @xcite , this lends further support to the argument that the change in @xmath32 signals the breaking of a @xmath67-symmetry @xcite . at the very least this proposition appears to be intriguing enough to warrant further investigation .
we finally caution the reader that we so far have not been able to detect any anomaly in specific heat at the suggested new finite - field transition inside the vortex liquid , for the isotropic case .
even the anomaly at the first order melting transition is weak in the isotropic case , and is difficult to bring out in simulations .
it may be that considerably larger systems are needed for the isotropic case in order to see signals in the specific heat of the suggested new transition due to the small amount of entropy in the transition .
this is the reason why the anomaly at the first order vortex lattice melting transition is difficult to observe in simulations .
it is conceivable that increasing the anisotropy of the system should bring out the anomaly clearer , if it exists .
this indeed is the case for the anomaly at the vortex lattice melting transition . a weak anomaly associated with the putative @xmath67-transition , may in fact
have been observed for the anisotropic case in ref . .

these authors calculated the connectivity of a vortex tangle in a high - temperature superconductor and concluded that the connectivity changed as a result of a percolation transition taking place in the _ vortex lattice _ , considering systems that were much smaller than in the present paper .
they did not attempt to identify any broken symmetry with the suggested transition , and concluded that this percolation transition was _ necessary _ in order to have dissipation in the c - direction .
however , as the present results show , and as the results of ref .
show , it is not necessary to have a percolation transition to destroy longitudinal superfluidity . the change in @xmath32 is _ preempted _ by the loss of longitudinal phase - coherence and onset of longitudinal dissipation .
we believe these results are a consequence of too short simulation times , possibly on too small systems . for finite - size effects on @xmath113 , see fig . 2 of ref . , where systems considerably larger than those of jagla _ et al .
_ were considered .
we thank j. s. hye for helpful discussions on this point .
a similar functional form for @xmath87 involving the effective line tension , i.e. the free energy per unit length of a vortex line , is to our knowledge not available for the finite - field case and we have been unable to carry out a similar analysis when the field is non - zero .

these authors concluded that the loss of line tension at finite field is associated with the loss of longitudinal phase coherence . the present work , as well as that of refs .
, shows that this is not correct .
the longitudinal phase - coherence vanishes at the melting transition of the vortex lattice .
this is related to the comments made above , in ref . .
it is not excluded that the @xmath67-symmetry proposed here may be broken in a first order phase transition even in the absence of gauge - fluctuations , in a finite magnetic field .
for the zero - field case this is known to happen provided gauge - fluctuations are taken into acount , see b. i. halperin , s. k. ma , and t. c. lubensky , phys .

 this work clarifies an important issue : the unpinned vortex liquid is always _ incoherent _ with no phase coherence in any directions for all anisotropies . 
 previous claims of a disentangled vortex liquid for isotropic superconductors based on simulations , are due to finite size effects . 
 we explicitly show that the effective vortex - line tension vanishes precisely at the superconducting phase transition in zero magnetic field . 
 this loss of line tension is accompanied by an abrupt change in the connectivity of the vortex tangle across the superconductor . 
 we also obtain results indicating that the connectivity of the vortex tangle changes in a similar way even in finite magnetic field , and suggest that this could also be associated with a genuine phase - transition .    2 "
"photonic crystals are ordered nanostructures with a periodicity on the scale of the optical wavelength .
the perfect periodic ordering gives rise to a photonic band structure and properties such as slow light , negative refraction , and photonic band gaps.@xcite photonic crystals are of importance for their potential in controlling the transport and emission of light at the nanoscale.@xcite apart from the properties of perfect photonic crystals , such as a 3d photonic bandgap , the possibility of combining band structure with controlled random multiple scattering has raised considerable interest .
macroscopic photonic crystals can be assembled bottom - up using colloidal suspensions , or top - down using lithographic techniques .
all crystals have some degree of intrinsic disorder due to polydispersity of the building blocks or imperfections in fabrication.@xcite in order to realize random multiple scattering without relying on intrinsic disorder , another route has been explored to intentionally design disorder in three - dimensional photonic crystals of very high quality.@xcite the role of disorder has recently been investigated in photonic crystal waveguides.@xcite    the presence of disorder results in diffusive scattering of light and a concomitant disappearance of the photonic band structure . however ,
theoretical and experimental studies indicate that an intermediate regime exists , where photonic band structure is preserved locally but medium - range disorder disrupts ballistic transport@xcite .
this intermediate scattering regime is reached when the scattering mean free path @xmath0 exceeds the bragg length@xcite @xmath1 but is smaller than the sample size @xmath2 : @xmath3 . as was pointed out by sajeev john
, the modified density of states associated with the photonic bands near a 3d photonic band gap may result in large corrections to the diffuse transport , as is known for completely random systems.@xcite recently it has been argued that the scattering mean free path in opals with designed disorder yield contributions from both the local density of states and group velocity.@xcite ultimately , the photonic crystal could facilitate the complete breakdown of light diffusion known as anderson localization .
indeed , indications of anderson localization have been observed in recent studies on one - dimensional photonic crystal waveguides@xcite and nonlinear lattices @xcite . despite recent experimental efforts@xcite ,
this regime has not yet been observed in a three dimensional photonic crystal .
effects of multiple light scattering in photonic crystals have been studied before using a variety of reflection and transmission measurements , including coherent backscattering of light [ fig .
[ fig : setup](a ) ] . coherent backscattering ( cbs ) is a multiple scattering phenomenon caused by the constructive interference of time - reversed light paths in the medium in a cone around the backscattering direction .
coherent backscattering has been used to investigate multiple scattering of photonic crystals at a few discrete wavelengths.@xcite recently the first broad - band investigations of opal photonic crystals around the stop band have been reported.@xcite modifications of cbs cones around the photonic stop bands have been observed which were attributed to two contributions related to the modification of the diffuse source by bragg reflection , and to variations of the internal reflection conditions at the escape angle of the diffuse light , as shown schematically in fig .
[ fig : setup](b ) .
both effects can significantly affect the path length distribution for multiple scattering .    here
, we present experiments demonstrating the effect of the photonic band structure on diffuse light scattering over a wide spectral and angular range in polystyrene opals .
we employ a broad - band coherent backscattering technique using a supercontinuum white - light source.@xcite the technique has been used successfully to investigate strongly photonic random media , i.e. tio@xmath4 powder and porous gap , and to characterize resonant light trapping by semiconductor nanowires.@xcite compared to earlier studies on photonic crystals @xcite , we achieve a more detailed characterization of cbs as a function of both angle of incidence and wavelength .
this investigation over an extensive range of angles and frequencies allows us to compare the results with semi - empirical model calculations to verify earlier predictions.@xcite

( b ) photonic crystal effects influencing the apparent mean free path : 1 .

modification of angle - dependent escape probability due to internal reflection .
, width=309 ]    coherent backscattering spectra were obtained over a wide spectral range in the visible and near - infrared using a supercontinuum white - light backscattering setup described previously in ref .  .
the angular resolution was improved to 0.8  mrad full width at half maximum , in order to resolve the narrow cbs cones of photonic crystals.@xcite small - angle coherent backscattering measurements were obtained in a beamsplitter configuration as shown in fig .
[ fig : setup](a ) .
circular polarization channels were selected using achromatic polarizers and a quarter wave plate directly in front of the sample , with the purpose of reducing the contribution of single scattering in the cbs enhancement factor .
the opals used in this study were obtained by sedimentation of polystyrene spheres ( duke scientific , polydispersity @xmath52% ) in 0.3  mm thick , 3  mm wide flat glass capillaries ( vitro dynamics ) .
we used two opals composed of spheres of radii 130  nm and 180  nm , which were grown from a suspension in water using a centrifuge.@xcite after crystallization the water was slowly evaporated from the capillaries to produce polycrystalline opals of several millimeters in length .
the polystyrene opal is an _
fcc_-crystal with the [ 111 ] crystallographic direction ( corresponding to @xmath6__l _ _ ) oriented perpendicular to its surface , as was demonstrated by small - angle x - ray scattering.@xcite the corresponding wigner - seitz cell is shown in fig .
[ fig : reflspectra](a ) , while fig .
[ fig : reflspectra](b ) shows the calculated band structure and density of states . in our experiments
we investigate the behavior around the stopgap at l , which is located at @xmath7 angle of incidence and has a bandwidth of 6% as predicted by band structure calculations and measured in many reports on opals elsewhere.@xcite by tilting the sample , we gain access to directions away from the l - gap corresponding to _ lk _ , _ lu _ , and _ lw _ in the band diagram . in the experiments we average over many crystalline regions with random orientations in the ( 111 ) plane , and the crystal
is spun around its @xmath6l - axis to average individual speckle .
therefore all directions in the ( 111 ) plane will contribute to our experimental results . since the _ lk _ and _ lu _ directions are very similar , we focus on the _ lu _ and _ lw _ bands in the interpretation of our results . also shown in fig .

a clear dispersion is observed of the stop band , which is centered at 16800  @xmath15 for the @xmath8  nm opal and at 12200  @xmath15 for the @xmath12  nm opal at near - perpendicular incidence .
the frequencies of the half - maximum band edges are shown in figs .

this results in the dimensionless scaled units @xmath16 as shown in the right axes of fig .
[ fig : reflectivities](b ) and ( d ) , and values of the lattice constant of 362  nm and 510  nm , respectively .
these values are in good accord with expected values based on the sphere radii using @xmath17 .
the experimental dispersion of the stop band matches well the expected behavior for an _ fcc _ opal .
the full width at half maximum of the reflection peaks of @xmath18 is in excellent agreement with the photonic interaction strength @xmath19 defined as the relative frequency width of the stop gap at the l - point predicted by band structure calculations .
in addition , higher order bands approach the stop band at angles @xmath14 around 60@xmath20 , resulting in a more complex behavior of the reflected intensity@xcite , as is observed for the @xmath12  nm sample .
given the spectral range covered by our experimental setup , a set of samples is needed to span nearly a factor three in frequency ( @xmath21 ) that ranges from well below the first order l - gap to the range of second order gaps that are the precursors of the inverse opal band gaps .

is shown in fig .
[ fig : cbsimage](a ) .
the cbs spectrum shows a pronounced structure around 16800  @xmath15 , corresponding to the center frequency of the stop gap .
the arrows indicate frequencies below , inside , and above the stop gap , for which cross - sections are shown in fig  [ fig : cbsimage](b ) .
we note that the height of the cbs cones is not at all related to the peak of the reflectivity in fig .
[ fig : reflectivities](a ) .
the traces show the typical cbs lineshape , which can be fitted to a model of random light scattering [ lines in fig  [ fig : cbsimage](b ) ] .
we employed a finite slab model analogous to ref .  , where the slab thickness was fixed for the full data set .
the residuals of all fits are less than 5% , illustrating a very good match .
this agreement indicates that the diffusion green functions are sufficient to calculate the path length distribution underlying the cbs cones , without requiring the addition of photonic band structure effects .
the validity of the random scattering model is consistent with earlier experiments.@xcite theory has indeed confirmed that isotropic diffuse transport is obtained for crystal structures with high symmetry , even when scattering between individual modes is highly anisotropic.@xcite    the model fits using the random scattering theory yield values for the apparent mean free path @xmath23 , which relates to the width of the cbs cones according to @xmath27 , and the cbs enhancement factor @xmath24 .
spectra of both the apparent mean free path @xmath28 and the enhancement factor @xmath24 ( obtained from data in fig .
[ fig : cbsimage](a ) ) are shown in fig  [ fig : cbsimage](c , d ) ( dots ) .
the dashed vertical lines indicate the high and low - energy edges of the photonic stop band obtained from the reflectivity data . for comparison
we also show the @xmath23 spectra obtained at @xmath29 ( open triangles ) . at this angle ,
the photonic stop band has shifted outside of the spectral range , and the frequency variation of the mean free path mainly corresponds to a background resulting from structural variations in the crystal.@xcite we modeled this variation of the mean free path to a power law @xmath30 , yielding an exponent @xmath31 ( dash - dotted line , green ) .
this exponent is much less than that of pure rayleigh scattering ( @xmath32 ) , and also less than the rayleigh - gans dependence ( @xmath33 ) found for the transmission of similar opals.@xcite the low - frequency value of @xmath0 of around 20  @xmath34 m translates to a ratio @xmath35 for our crystal ( @xmath36  nm ) , in agreement with the long - wavelength values observed for similar samples in ref .  .    for the @xmath37 spectrum in fig
[ fig : cbsimage](c ) , a pronounced trough is observed in @xmath23 at frequencies that correspond to the measured l - gap .
a similar behavior has been observed in experiments @xcite , and was first predicted in ref .   based on a reduction of the penetration depth of the diffuse source by bragg reflection .
qualitatively , a reduced penetration depth implies shorter paths , as paths are more likely to meet the sample boundary and exit .
hence bragg reflection causes cone broadening .
the reduction of @xmath23 extends far outside the stop gap , especially toward the lower - frequency side , consistent with the behavior of the reflectivity spectra in fig .
[ fig : reflectivities](a ) .
this observation shows the importance of measuring over a large bandwidth in frequency , including a significant range well below the stop gap : it is only far below the stop gap that one retrieves a transport mean free path that is a true measure of the disorder in photonic crystals .
the bragg length associated with the l - gap can be estimated from the interaction strength according to @xmath38 , yielding @xmath39  @xmath34 m .
this corresponds to a ratio @xmath40 , in the l - gap , which fulfills the inequality for the intermediate scattering regime ( @xmath3 ) .

[ fig : cbsimage](d ) are consistently low compared to values obtained for strongly scattering random photonic media measured using the same instrument.@xcite this behavior is particularly striking below the stop band , where photonic crystals are commonly expected to behave as an effective medium.@xcite the enhancement factor ranges between 1.4 and 1.5 , which is larger than values reported by huang et al.@xcite but smaller than measured in ref .
a reduction of the enhancement factor below the stop band was also reported in ref .  .
the ideal enhancement factor of two is expected in any multiple scattering sample , whether absorbing and of finite size or not , as long as the sample obeys reciprocity . however ,
if scattering components contribute that have no distinct time reversed counterpart , such as single scattering , the enhancement factor is reduced.@xcite in addition to this general trend , we find pronounced variations of @xmath24 around the stop gap . at the band edge ,
two sharp troughs appear in fig .

apart from photonic band structure effects , we observe a gradual decrease of @xmath42 , which can be modeled using @xmath43 for the spectrum at @xmath44 .

we point out the asymmetry of both the mean free path and the enhancement factor over the stop band in fig .
[ fig : cu180cbsfits](b ) .
such asymmetry can not be explained by the group velocity behavior as this is symmetrical around the stop gap.@xcite    at angles of incidence above @xmath47 [ cf .
[ fig : cu180cbsfits](c ) ] , a second trough in @xmath23 appears around 19000  @xmath15 .
comparison with the band structure calculations of fig .
[ fig : reflectivities ] reveals that this feature can be attributed to another bragg reflection at oblique @xmath48 planes , which appears around @xmath49 at the @xmath50 and @xmath51 points in the brillouin zone .
the presence of this band is also clearly observed as a trough in the enhancement factor @xmath24 in fig .
[ fig : cu180cbsfits](f ) .
the presence of this higher - order diffraction peak demonstrates that the observed behavior has to be described by the full 3d photonic band structure and not just by a simple one - dimensional bragg reflector .

in this section we discuss the combined frequency and angle - dependence of the width of the cbs cone .
our starting point for the description of diffuse light scattering in the crystal is the theory for random photonic media that we extend for the effects of the photonic crystal band structure.@xcite according to predictions by ref .
[ ] , the cone width is modified by two effects : internal reflection@xcite and the limited penetration depth of the incident light when its wavelength matches the bragg condition . a larger internal reflection results in longer paths , providing a narrowing of the cbs cone . in contrast , reduction of the penetration depth leads to shorter paths as the light has a larger probability to exit via the surface , resulting in a broadening of the cone .
it has been shown that the resulting correction to the cbs cone can be included in the random diffusion model by introducing an apparent mean free path @xmath23 which is given by@xcite @xmath52}{[1+(\epsilon+\tau_e)\xi]},\ ] ] with @xmath53 here @xmath54 is the internal reflection coefficient integrated over all angles as put forward in the theory for multiple light scattering.@xcite the penetration depth of the incident light is included in the parameter @xmath55 .
the bragg length varies between infinity ( no bragg diffraction ) and @xmath56 , with @xmath19 the photonic strength and @xmath57 the lattice constant in the ( 111)-direction .
we use the extrapolation length ratios @xmath58 and @xmath59 that were originally derived for random media.@xcite     internal reflection coefficient calculated using the three - gap model of eq .
( [ eq:3-bandrefl]).,width=257 ]      we propose to capture the essential optical properties of the photonic crystals by the three dominant stop gaps .
therefore , the internal - reflection coefficient of the opals is modeled as the sum of three gaussian reflection peaks @xmath60 \ , , \ ] ] with angle - dependent peak reflectivities and widths @xmath61 and @xmath62 , with @xmath63 . following earlier successful descriptions of the angle dependent reflectivities @xcite and
escape function@xcite , we use the gaps along the lu high - symmetry direction to model the reflectivity , and assume a dependence on angle according to @xmath64 , where the cosine - dependence is based on simple bragg diffraction .
the frequencies @xmath65 are obtained from the calculated band edges in fig .
[ fig : reflectivities](d ) .        using the three - gap model described by eq .
( [ eq:3-bandrefl ] ) , the internal reflection @xmath54 is obtained by angle - averaging for every frequency using @xcite @xmath66 with @xmath67 the resulting values of the internal reflection for an opal photonic crystal are shown in fig .
[ fig : intrefl ] . the internal reflection due to photonic band structure ranges between zero and 14% in the frequency range of interest .
we notice three peaks in the spectrum of @xmath54 , which can be attributed to the l - gap and the avoided crossing at the u and w points . the internal reflection contribution
should not be confused with effects due to density of states , which also are independent of angle .
there is a fundamental physical difference between these two physical parameters : the internal reflection coefficient is the result of gaps , in other words , of the absence of states .
conversely , the density of states is a sum over states , and is thus the result of the presence of states .
moreover , the variations in @xmath54 are much greater than those in the density of states , see fig .
[ fig : reflspectra](b ) and refs .
[ , ] .      at the center of the stop gap
, the following expression holds for the bragg length @xmath1 in a two - band model@xcite @xmath68 the bragg length varies between eq .
( [ eq : lbragg ] ) at the bragg condition and infinity outside the stop band . in absence of a theoretical description of @xmath1
, we assume here @xmath1 to be inversely proportional to the reflectivity around the stop gap @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the internal reflection coefficient defined in eq .
( [ eq:3-bandrefl ] ) and @xmath19 is the photonic strength obtained from band structure calculations and experiments .
this definition of @xmath1 is chosen as it provides the right value in the middle of the gap , the peak in @xmath71 follows the reflection coefficient as expected , and outside the reflection peaks @xmath1 becomes very large , as expected .
furthermore , a reduced reflection coefficient yields an increase of @xmath1 , which is qualitatively consistent with experiments by vlasov et al .
and bertone et al.@xcite more accurate modelling of @xmath1 is beyond the scope of our semi - empirical analysis .
the modification of the diffuse source by bragg reflection is included in eq .
( [ eq : ellw ] ) through the parameter @xmath72 .
the parameter @xmath73 can be identified as the inverse penetration depth of the light in the crystal due to bragg reflection.@xcite below we will calculate the effect of photonic stop bands on @xmath73 for the opals under study .
we note that the model presented for internal reflection here is a rigorous framework in multiple scattering theory , barring the introduction of a semi - empirical description of the band structure in eq .
( [ eq:3-bandrefl ] ) and eq .
( [ eq : lbraggnew ] ) .
these approximations limit detailed comparison particularly at the edges of the stop band .
our model is highly constrained , as the only adjustable parameters that we allow to vary are the @xmath74 that are constant or very smoothly varying .      using the model above
, we will estimate the effects of the internal reflection and source distributions on the cbs cone width .
values of @xmath0 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 were optimized to achieve good agreement with the experimental data of fig .
[ fig : allfitcmaps ] , yielding @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 .
these four coefficients together with the overall scaling of the mean free path are the only adjustable parameters used to fit the data for all frequencies and incidence angles .
the small value of @xmath76 is chosen since this band does not have a pronounced appearance in our experimental data .
figure  [ fig : modelbroadening](a ) shows the effect of internal reflection only on @xmath23 .
the increase of @xmath54 results in a narrowing of the cone and thus an increase of @xmath23 according to eq .
( [ eq : ellw ] ) , which does not depend on angle of incidence @xmath14 .
in contrast , the inverse penetration depth @xmath73 , shown in fig .
[ fig : modelbroadening](b ) , follows the band structure according to eq .
( [ eq:3-bandrefl ] ) .
the two contributions are combined to yield the apparent mean free path as shown in fig .
[ fig : allfitcmaps](c , d ) for the two opals . for comparison with the experimental data , we included the power law dependence of the background mean free path in absence of photonic effects . the calculated maps for @xmath23 in fig .
[ fig : allfitcmaps ] agree well with most of the experimental observations .
the cross sections , shown as red lines in figs .  [ fig : cbsimage ] and [ fig : cu180cbsfits ] , reveal that the depth of the correction on @xmath23 closely matches the experimental behavior .
however , the effect of internal reflection , predicted as an increase of @xmath23 before the stop band at larger angles , is not consistent with our experimental data .
we note that effects of internal reflection are generally difficult to disentangle from smoothly varying corrections on @xmath23 of the order of 10% .
the predominant modification of the cone width in the photonic crystals under study is caused by the reduction of the penetration depth , as is illustrated by calculations including only this correction ( dashed lines , blue ) .      here
, we will briefly discuss the remarkable behavior of the cbs - enhancement factor .
after elimination of spurious background contributions to the intensity , variations in @xmath24 can only be caused by changes in the intensity and polarization of single - scattered light .
the low enhancements at small reduced frequencies are particularly puzzling , since photonic crystals in the long wavelength limit are widely expected to behave as effective weakly scattering media.@xcite a similar reduction of @xmath24 in the long - wavelength limit was observed for thin slabs of nanowires , which was explained by the finite thickness @xmath2 of the layer of the order @xmath80 and the concomitant suppression of higher scattering orders.@xcite for the current samples , in the long wavelength regime , @xmath81 is still larger than 15 .
therefore we can exclude finite sample thickness as an origin for the low enhancement .
the effect of stop gaps on single scattering may be caused by changes in intensity or polarization of the single - scattered light . while absorption loss does not change the enhancement factor @xmath82 for an ideal experiment where only multiply scattered light is collected , absorption might influence @xmath24 via the ratio between single and multiply scattered light .
however , absorption would also be apparent as a cone rounding . by analyzing the cone rounding , we note that the diffuse absorption length is equal to or even greater than the sample thickness , i.e. 200  @xmath34 m .
this value corresponds to an absorption decay length of 6 mm , in agreement with our previous measurements.@xcite therefore , we conclude that the role of absorption loss is negligible .
variations in the total scattering intensity are observed around the stop gap in our samples , as shown in fig .
[ fig : scattering ] , consistent with the behavior reported in other work.@xcite we see a minimum in the stop gap with two wings of high scattering at the band edges .
inside the stop gap , the bragg reflection removes intensity from the diffuse scattering .
this redistribution does not necessarily influence the cbs enhancement factor considering that the bragg peak does not lead to additional single scattering .
a decrease of the incoherent single scattering background in the stop gap may even be expected as single scattering from the photonic crystal coherently adds to the specular bragg reflection and is thus suppressed at other angles .
the overall increase of scattering intensity toward shorter wavelengths and larger angles of incidence is consistent with an increase of the enhancement factor which can be attributed to more efficient randomization of light in the medium .     scattering intensity from the 130-nm ( a ) and 180-nm ( b ) opals , for angles of incidence from 8@xmath20 to 50@xmath20 , measured at a detection angle of 5@xmath20 using helicity conserving channel .
subsequent spectra are offset by 0.5 for visibility , starting from @xmath29 ( no offset).,width=325 ]    another pronounced feature in @xmath24 are the troughs at the band edges observed for the @xmath8  nm opal in fig .
[ fig : cbsimage](d ) .
the conditions of these throughs appears correlated with presence of sharp peaks in the scattering intensity of fig .
[ fig : scattering](a ) , which currently is not explained by any models .
these effects resemble the characteristic behavior of the group velocity as well as recent measurements of scattering mean free path.@xcite such a reduction of the single scattering length @xmath83 at the band edges is not observed in the apparent mean free path @xmath23 of fig .
[ fig : cbsimage](c ) , as @xmath23 is averaged over many different directions in the crystal .
we propose that the cbs enhancement factor is inherently more sensitive to directional band structure effects through its dependence on single - scattering , and therefore changes of @xmath83 can result in variations of @xmath24 .
the large variations in @xmath24 observed in our experiment call for new theory for diffuse light in ( partially ) ordered nanophotonic materials .
some of the variations in the cbs enhancement can not be associated with the behavior of the total scattering intensity in fig .
[ fig : scattering ] , but may be associated to the use of circularly polarized light in our experiments .
markedly , there is the drop in @xmath24 associated with the second stop band at @xmath44 .
this opposite behavior to the increase of @xmath24 in the l - gap points to a difference in helicity of single scattering , possibly due to brewster angle effects.@xcite for the l - gap at @xmath7 , the parallel and perpendicular components perceive exactly the same bragg reflectivities and thus no change of the polarization state of circularly polarized incident light should occur .
strong polarization dependence of light transmitted and reflected from opals was identified in several studies.@xcite polarization effects have also been found in ref .  , where in particular cross - polarized cbs cones were reported .
our measurements of the cross - polarized channel only showed an angle - independent response ; no cross - polarized cbs cones were detected .
we have investigated multiple scattering of light in three - dimensional polystyrene opal photonic crystals using white - light coherent backscattering spectroscopy .
our experiments significantly extend on earlier measurements by covering simultaneously a large frequency and angular range .
the measurements of the backscattering cone width at frequencies near the stop bands confirm the model by refs .
[ ] which includes internal reflection and the limited penetration depth of the incident light .
the semi - empirical model matches the experiments without the need to include effects of density of states or group velocity , such as were proposed in ref .
in addition , we report photonic band structure contributions in the cbs enhancement factor .
we propose that the cbs enhancement factor , being particularly sensitive to single scattering , thus contains information on properties which are washed out in other aspects of the multiple scattering cbs cone
. a better understanding of group velocity and other band structure effects to the enhancement factor will require further theoretical studies .
the presented experimental approach using white - light coherent backscattering opens up studies on diffuse light transport in novel materials .
future investigations may look toward stronger scattering photonic crystals such as tio@xmath4 or silicon inverse opals or silicon inverse woodpiles@xcite , for which effects of the density of states could be observable .
other examples where the interplay of disorder - or reduced symmetry - and band structure is expected to result in novel phenomena are photonic quasicrystals@xcite and optical graphene.@xcite

"in particle physics experiments one often tests specific models that predict new phenomena . some regions of a model s parameter space may be rejected by these tests ; in other regions the model may be deemed compatible with the data .
this is often done in the framework of a frequentist statistical test , which is inverted to determine a confidence interval .
this formalism is reviewed in sec .
[ sec : confint ] .
it is generally the case that for some parameter values of a signal model , the magnitude of the predicted effect with respect to the background - only model is extremely small .
that is , one has effectively no experimental sensitivity to those parts of the model s parameter space .
nevertheless , procedures based on frequentist tests may exclude these values .
we discuss how this can occur and how it has been dealt with in the past in sections  [ sec : spur ] and [ sec : cls ] .    in sec .
[ sec : pcl ] we introduce a new method for constraining confidence intervals in a way that prevents one from excluding parameter values to which one does not have sufficient sensitivity .
as the measure of sensitivity is based on the power of a statistical test , we refer to the bounds established by these modified intervals as power - constrained limits ( pcl ) .
section  [ sec : gausslim ] illustrates the procedure for the case of an upper limit derived from a gaussian measurement .

[ sec : conclusions ] .
in this section we review the formalism of inverting a frequentist statistical test to obtain a confidence interval .
a more thorough treatment can be found in many texts , such as ref .
@xcite .
we consider a test for a parameter @xmath4 , which here represents the signal strength ( or any parameter proportional to the rate ) of a certain signal process .
a test of a given @xmath4 is carried out by specifying a region of data outcomes called the _ critical region _ , which are disfavoured , in a sense discussed below , under assumption of @xmath4 .
the data outcome could be , for example , the number of events observed in a given region of phase space , or it could represent a larger set of numerical values . here we will use @xmath5 to represent the data , and @xmath6 to denote the critical region .    the critical region is chosen to such that the probability to observe the data in it , under assumption of the hypothesized @xmath4 , is not greater than a given constant @xmath7 , called the _ size _ or _ significance level _ of the test , i.e. ,    @xmath8    often by convention @xmath9 is used .
if the data are observed in the critical region , the hypothesis @xmath4 is rejected .
it is necessary in general to specify eq .
( [ eq : sizeoftest ] ) as an inequality because the data may be discrete ( e.g. , an integer number of events ) , and so there may not exist a subset of the possible data values for which the summed probability is exactly equal to @xmath7 .    it is convenient to construct from the data a test statistic @xmath10 , such that greater @xmath10 reflects an increasing level of incompatibility between the data and the hypothesized parameter value @xmath4 . in this way the boundary of the critical region in data space is given by a surface of constant @xmath10 , with the critical region containing the data that give the greatest values of @xmath10
once such a function has been defined , one can for any observed value @xmath11 compute a @xmath12-value , i.e. , the probability under assumption of @xmath4 to find data with equal or greater incompatibility with @xmath4 ,    @xmath13    where @xmath14 represents the probability density function ( pdf ) of @xmath10 assuming a data distribution with strength parameter @xmath4 . thus the test can be equivalently formulated by rejecting @xmath4 if its @xmath12-value is found less than @xmath7 .
a test of size @xmath7 can be carried out for all values of @xmath4 .
the set of values not rejected constitutes a _ confidence interval _ for @xmath4 with confidence level @xmath15 .
this interval will by construction include the true value of the parameter with a probability of at least @xmath15 .
the procedure described above for constructing a confidence interval by inverting a test is not unique , however , because there are ( often infinitely ) many different subsets of the data space that could be chosen for the test s critical region @xmath6 .
this is usually selected such that the probability to find @xmath16 is large if a given alternative hypothesis ( or set of alternatives ) is true .
the _ power _ of the test with respect to an alternative value of the parameter @xmath17 , which we denote here as @xmath18 , is    @xmath19    if the test of @xmath4 is formulated using a @xmath12-value , such that finding @xmath20 is equivalent to finding @xmath21 , then the power can be written equivalently as    @xmath22    often the power with respect to certain alternatives is used as the criterion according to which one chooses the critical region of a test .
confidence intervals obtained from inverting the test thus depend on this choice . for the present discussion ,
however , we will assume that the test has been defined , and the power will be used only to modify the resulting confidence interval so that it does not exclude parameter values to which one does not have sufficient sensitivity .
this concept is defined more quantitatively in the following section .
when testing a hypothesized strength parameter @xmath4 , it may be that the magnitude of the signal implied by @xmath4 is extremely small  so small , that the probabilities for the data are very close to what they would be in the absence of the signal process , i.e. , @xmath23 .
in such a case one has little or no sensitivity to the given value of @xmath4 .    for example , fig .
[ fig : nosens ] illustrates a situation where there is only a very small level of sensitivity to a given strength parameter @xmath4 .
the plot shows the pdfs of the statistic @xmath10 under assumption of strength parameters @xmath4 , and also assuming @xmath24 , i.e. , @xmath14 and @xmath25 .
if the observed value of the statistic is found in the critical region corresponding to the top 5% of @xmath14 , then the hypothesized @xmath4 is rejected .
but as the two pdfs almost coincide , the probability to reject @xmath4 if the true strength parameter is zero is also close to @xmath9 .
( 10.0,6 . )
( 0.6,-0.5 )    ( 8.1,-0.5 )    ( 0.1,5.)(a ) ( 14.8,5.)(b )    figure  [ fig : nosens](b ) shows the same distributions as ( a ) but for a different value of @xmath4 .
the size of the test is , as in ( a ) , equal to @xmath7 . here
, however , the distribution of @xmath10 under the assumption of @xmath26 leads to a substantially greater probability to reject @xmath4 , i.e. , to find @xmath10 in the critical region .
the sensitivity of a test of @xmath4 can be quantified using the power of the test with respect to a stated alternative @xmath17 , which we will take here to be the no - signal hypothesis , @xmath26 . in the case where the pdfs @xmath14 and @xmath25 coincide , the probability to reject @xmath4 assuming the alternative @xmath27 approaches the significance level of the test , @xmath7 .    in the context of a search for a new phenomenon ,
this means that with probability not less than @xmath7 one will exclude hypotheses to which one has little or no sensitivity , which we refer to here as spurious exclusion .
the hypothesis might indeed be false , but if it is excluded , this is more naturally interpreted as a data fluctuation away from the region favoured under assumption of @xmath4 .
this could result , for example , in a search for a hypothetical particle with a mass far above the range where it would have a noticeable impact on the data .
particle physics experiments often carry out many searches covering a broad parameter range for many signal models , and so spurious exclusion is in fact a problem that can arise often .
the problem of spurious exclusion , or equivalently , having a `` lucky '' statistical fluctuation lead to an anomalously strong limit , has been known in the particle physics community for many years . the note by highland @xcite reviews the problem and proposes several possible solutions ; further discussion can be found in the review on statistics by the particle data group @xcite .
the problem received particular focus during searches for the higgs boson at the lep collider in the 1990s , and led to a procedure called `` @xmath0 '' @xcite .
here one forms the ratio    @xmath28    where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the @xmath12-values of the hypothesized strength parameter values @xmath4 and @xmath31 , respectively . in the @xmath0 procedure , @xmath4 is deemed to be excluded if one finds @xmath32 . because @xmath33 is aways greater than @xmath29 , the probability of exclusion assuming @xmath4 is necessarily less than @xmath7 .
thus the quoted upper limit from the @xmath0 procedure will be greater than the upper limit according to the method of sec .
[ sec : confint ] , and in this sense the @xmath0 procedure is said to be conservative .
this is illustrated in the example described in sec .
[ sec : gausslim ] .
because of this conservatism , the frequentist coverage probability of the @xmath0 upper limits ( i.e. , the probability under assumption of @xmath4 that the interval will contain @xmath4 ) is not equal to @xmath7 , but is in general larger .
although the exact coverage probabilities of @xmath0 intervals can be found as a function of @xmath4 , this is not often reported .
here we propose an alternate procedure for producing intervals whose coverage properties are easily apparent for all values of @xmath4 . to do this we break the range of @xmath4 to be tested into two categories based on the power @xmath34 of a test of @xmath4 with respect to the no - signal alternative , @xmath27 .
if this power is below a specified threshold @xmath35 , one s sensitivity to this parameter is deemed to be too low and the point is not regarded as testable . if the power is greater than or equal to the threshold , then the test of size @xmath7 is carried out .
a value of @xmath4 is excluded if    1 .
the value @xmath4 is rejected by the test , i.e. , @xmath16 or equivalently @xmath20 , and 2 .
one has sufficient sensitivity to @xmath4 , i.e. , @xmath36 .
an interval is constructed from the values of @xmath4 not excluded .
if this is done on the basis of the test ( a ) only , it is referred to here as an _ unconstrained _ interval .
application of the _ power constraint _
( b ) results in the power - constrained interval or limit .
the coverage probability of the power - constrained interval is @xmath37 for @xmath4 values that have power below @xmath35 , and @xmath7 for those values with power greater than or equal to the threshold . when reporting the result it is recommended to indicate which parameter values were above and which below the power - constraint threshold , and in this way one can easily see what the coverage probability is for all values of @xmath4 .
the choice of the minimum power threshold is a matter of convention .
we prefer to use @xmath38 , or more precisely , @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the standard normal cumulative distribution ( i.e. , the cumulative distribution for gaussian with a mean of zero and unit standard deviation ) .
as shown below , this corresponds to applying the power constraint if the unconstrained limit fluctuates one standard deviation below its median value under the background - only hypothesis .
this procedure bears some similarity to one introduced recently in the astrophysics community in ref .
@xcite , although there the power refers to a test of the background - only ( @xmath41 ) hypothesis , and furthermore the result is not used in quite the same way as what we propose here . note also in ref .
@xcite , `` upper bound '' is similar to what we call an upper limit , and their term `` upper limit '' is taken to refer to the sensitivity threshold .
formally , to construct the interval for @xmath4 one begins by finding the power for a test of each @xmath4 with respect to the alternative @xmath27 ,    @xmath42    in some problems this can be found in closed form ; otherwise it can be obtained using a monte carlo calculation , in which one for every value of @xmath4 calculates the distribution of @xmath29 using data generated according to @xmath41 .
the value @xmath34 is then found simply by integrating each distribution from zero up to the desired significance level @xmath7 ( e.g. , @xmath43 ) .
an equivalent and in ways simpler procedure is first to carry out the statistical test without the power constraint , and invert this to find the unconstrained confidence interval for @xmath4 .
some of the parameter values that are excluded from this interval may be found to have a power below the required threshold , and they are then re - included in the power - constrained interval , which is thus by construction a superset of the unconstrained one .
for example , one may be interested in finding an an upper limit , @xmath44 , i.e. , the largest value of @xmath4 not excluded . by inverting the test
, one determines @xmath44 as a function of the data .
one can therefore determine the distribution of @xmath44 , e.g. , by simulating the experiment many times under assumption of @xmath41 and constructing a histogram of @xmath44 for each outcome .
then for each value of @xmath4 one determines the corresponding power .
this is the probability , under assumption of the background - only ( @xmath41 ) hypothesis , to reject @xmath4 , i.e. , to find @xmath4 outside of the unconstrained confidence interval . in the case of an upper limit
this is    @xmath45    one should note the following caveat : it can be that for certain data outcomes , all values of @xmath4 are excluded by the test , in which case @xmath44 is not defined .
in such cases one must count the outcomes as contributing to the probability that @xmath4 is outside the confidence interval .    with this in mind , one can then find the smallest value of @xmath4 for which the power @xmath46 is at least equal to the minimum value @xmath35 , denoted here as @xmath47 . the power - constrained limit @xmath48 is given by the larger of the unconstrained limit @xmath44 or the minimum value to which one has sensitivity , @xmath47 :    @xmath49
often the test of @xmath4 is based on a gaussian distributed measurement .
for example , for a sufficiently large data sample and under conditions often satisfied in practice , the distribution of the maximum likelihood estimator @xmath50 has a gaussian form with standard deviation @xmath51 and is centred about the true @xmath4 . here
we will assume this is the case and further take @xmath51 to be known .
for the case of an upper limit , we define the critical region to contain the lowest values of @xmath50 such that the probability to find @xmath50 there is equal to @xmath7 . for gaussian
distributed @xmath50 with mean @xmath4 and standard deviation @xmath51 , the critical region is therefore    @xmath52    where @xmath53 is the inverse of the standard gaussian cumulative distribution ( the standard normal quantile ) .
for example , @xmath9 gives @xmath54 .
rejecting @xmath4 if the data are in the critical region gives the unconstrained upper limit ,    @xmath55    the power of the test of @xmath4 with respect to the alternative @xmath26 is    @xmath56    because @xmath50 here follows a gaussian distribution , the power can be written    @xmath57    this is illustrated in fig .
[ fig : powerfunc ] for @xmath58 and @xmath59 . since the cumulative distribution @xmath40 is monotonically increasing and furthermore @xmath60 , eq .
( [ eq : m0mu2 ] ) gives @xmath61 and @xmath62 for all @xmath63 , as can be seen in the figure .

( 5,4)[b ]    requiring the power @xmath36 ,    @xmath64    implies that the smallest @xmath4 to which one is sensitive is    @xmath65    by combining eqs .
( [ eq : muup1 ] ) and ( [ eq : mumin ] ) , one sees that @xmath44 is below @xmath66 if one finds    @xmath67    thus one finds the following expression for the power - constrained upper limit :    @xmath68                 \hat{\mu } + \sigma \phi^{-1}(1 - \alpha ) &                  \quad \quad \mbox{otherwise } \;.                 \end{array }                  \right.\ ] ]    this is shown as a function of @xmath50 in fig .

( 0.5,-0.5 )    ( 8,-0.5 )    ( 0.1,5.5)(a ) ( 14.9,5.5)(b )    for comparison , fig .
[ fig : muup](a ) also shows the upper limit without the power costraint ( here called `` classical '' ) as well as the one obtained from the @xmath0 procedure , which for this particular problem coincides with the bayesian upper limit when using a constant prior for @xmath69 .    figure  [ fig : muup](b ) shows the corresponding coverage probabilities for the upper limits . for pcl ,
this is 100% for @xmath70 , and 95% otherwise . for @xmath0 and bayesian ,
the coverage probability is everywhere greater than 95% , approaching 95% as @xmath4 increases .
as mentioned above , we prefer to take the minimum power threshold @xmath71 . from eq .
( [ eq : muhatcon1 ] ) one can see that if @xmath44 follows a gaussian distribution , this choice of @xmath35 corresponds to applying the power constraint if the data fluctuate below their expected value , under assumption of @xmath41 , by more than one standard deviation . here
we will refer to a fluctuation at this level as @xmath72 ( downward ) , regardless of the distribution of @xmath44 .
in fact , the distribution of @xmath44 often is close to gaussian so the terminology is natural and convenient .
this choice of @xmath35 can be motivated by the idea that a sufficiently small fluctuation should not result in spurious exclusion of the type that the pcl and @xmath0 procedures are intended to prevent .
if , for example , one were to require @xmath73 , then one would impose the power constraint whenever the observed limit is found below the median , i.e. , half of the time , which is not consistent with the notion of accepting small fluctuations .
therefore we feel requiring a power of 50% is too extreme .    on the other hand , for any ( unbiased ) test
, the power is always greater than or equal to the significance level @xmath7 .
so if one were to take @xmath74 then the result is the same as the unconstrained limit .
since one often takes @xmath9 , taking @xmath75 would correspond to a @xmath76 downward fluctuation ( i.e. , @xmath77 ) .
sensitivity to the parameter @xmath4 corresponds having a power @xmath34 substantially larger than the significance level @xmath7
. therefore one would like to take @xmath35 large with respect to @xmath7 , while still allowing for moderate a downward fluction of the limit before imposing the power constraint .
we therefore believe @xmath78 is a natural choice for use with @xmath9 .
this allows for fluctuations up to the one - sigma level before imposing the power constraint , and the difference between @xmath9 and @xmath38 is sufficient to ensure a reasonable sensitivity .
if one were to take , e.g. , @xmath79 , as is done in some analyses , then one may consider that a somewhat larger @xmath35 is appropriate .
in many searches for new phenomena , one may carry out the analysis for a range of parameters in the signal model .
for example , when searching for the higgs boson one may carry out the analysis for each value of the mass @xmath80 .
in this situation one can simply repeat the power - constraint procedure for each value of the signal model s parameters , as is illustrated in fig .
[ fig : pclband ] .

[ fig : pclband ] , the solid line represents the median value of the unconstrained upper limit @xmath44 , and the lower and upper dashed curves are the 0.16 and 0.84 quantiles of the distribution of @xmath44 . the dotted curve in fig .
[ fig : pclband ] represents a possible outcome for the unconstrained limit @xmath44 .
the minimum power is taken to be @xmath81 , and thus the power - constrained limit is the greater of the dotted and lower dashed curves , as indicated by the shaded curve .
in many analyses , the probability model that describes the data is not uniquely specified by the parameter ( or parameters ) of interest , but rather also contains nuisance parameters .
that is , the values of these parameters are not known a priori and they must be fitted using the data . for concreteness suppose the model is characterized by a strength parameter @xmath4 and a set of nuisance parameters @xmath82 .
the nuisance parameters complicate the present problem in two ways .
first , they make it difficult to construct an unconstrained interval for the parameter of interest that has the correct coverage probability for all values of @xmath83 .
this problem has been widely discussed in recent years , e.g. , ref .
many of the proposed procedures give intervals with correct coverage for some values of @xmath83 , but approximate coverage elsewhere .
for example , an approximate solution based on the profile likelihood ratio test is discussed in refs .
@xcite . for the present discussion
we will assume that a test procedure that gives an unconstrained interval has been chosen .
its coverage probability may or may not be exactly equal to the nominal confidence level for all values of @xmath83 .    of more direct concern for the present paper is the fact that the power of the test of @xmath4 with respect to the no - signal alternative will depend in general on the nuisance parameters @xmath83 .
as the power is intended to represent the probability , under assumption of the no - signal model , to reject a given value of @xmath4 , we take the values of @xmath83 that are in best agreement with the actual data under assumption of @xmath41 .
we denote these as @xmath84 , i.e. , they are the conditional estimators for @xmath83 under assumption of @xmath41 .    as a consequence of this choice ,
the power @xmath46 becomes a function of the actual data , since the data are used to determine values for the nuisance parameters .
thus the range of @xmath4 values where one has sufficient sensitivity also depends to some extent on the data .
this may seem counter - intuitive , since the power of a specific test , i.e. , at a given point in @xmath85-space , is independent of the data .
but there is a certain power @xmath46 for every point in @xmath83-space , and one uses the data to choose the point at which one quotes the power .    alternatively , one could require that the power is greater than or equal to the minimum threshold for all values of the nuisance parameters in a specified range .
in this way the set of @xmath4 values for which one has sufficient sensitivity would not depend on the data . as this would entail considerable computational effort
, however , we prefer to define the power using a specific point in the nuisance - parameter space as described above .
we propose a power - constraint procedure for modifying confidence limits so that parameter values to which one has little or no sensitivity are not excluded .
the sensitivity is measured using the power of the test of the parameter with respect to the no - signal alternative .
the coverage probability of the resulting limits is equal to the nominal confidence level ( e.g. , 95% ) for parameter values to which one s sensitivity is above a given threshold , and 100% if the sensitivity is below the threshold .
this can be contrasted with the @xmath0 procedure , for which the coverage probability is always greater than the nominal confidence level by an amount that varies continuously as a function of the assumed parameter value .
the power used for the sensitivity threshold is a matter of convention , but we recommend taking this to be @xmath86 .
this is consistent with allowing for reasonably small downward fluctuations of the data by drawing the boundary at the one - sigma level .
allowing more than @xmath76 fluctuations would mean the power constraint is never imposed ( for a 95% confidence level limit ) , and requiring @xmath87 would impose the power constraint half of the time , including cases with only an infinitesimal downward fluctuation .
the pcl procedure is easily extended to problems with nuisance parameters . there
we define the power with respect to the background - only ( @xmath41 ) model using the conditional estimates of the nuisance parameters given @xmath41 .
the pcl procedure is particularly useful in cases where spurious exclusion is problematic , such as when a one - sided test is inverted to give an upper limit .
it can be applied , however , to any confidence interval , including those based on inversion of a likelihood - ratio test ( i.e. , feldman - cousins intervals @xcite ) .
when reporting results , we recommend to show both the constrained and unconstrained limits . in this way one can know whether a given parameter value is not rejected because the data are in good agreement with it , or rather because it is a value to which the sensitivity is deemed to low to allow exclusion .

"one of the most useful statistics for the evolution and clustering properties of faint , distant galaxies is the two - point angular correlation function @xmath0 .
it measures the excess number of pairs of galaxies separated by angle @xmath6 on the sky . for a given galaxy sample
, @xmath0 depends on the redshift distribution of the galaxies , and the three dimensional clustering amplitude @xmath7 . as pointed out by koo & szalay ( 1984 )
, @xmath0 can be used to constrain models of the evolution and clustering of faint galaxies at intermediate and high redshift .
a large number of investigations have measured the correlation for faint magnitudes in different passbands , bernstein 1994 ; brainerd , smail , & mould 1995 ( bsm ) ; couch , jurcevic , & boyle 1993 ; efstathiou 1991 ; neuschaefer , windhorst , & dressler 1991 ; roche 1993 .
there is a general consensus that @xmath0 can be approximated by a power law with slope of @xmath8 and an amplitude that decreases with increasing limiting magnitude
. there is , however , little consensus on what that means in terms of luminosity evolution , merger history , and clustering .
the number counts as a function of magnitude , ( lilly 1991 , smail 1995 ) , and the redshift surveys to faint magnitudes ( broadhurst 1992 , glazebrook 1994 ) put significant constraints on the galaxy evolution .
weak gravitational lensing of distant galaxies , equivalent to a systematic induced magnification and distortion without multiple imaging , is a probe of the large scale mass distribution of the universe , ( gunn 1967 ) . essentially , when a light ray from a distant galaxy passes through an overdense region in mass , the image will be magnified and distorted tangentially with respect to the center of the mass overdensity .
this effect has been measured in a number of galaxy clusters , [ tyson , valdes , & wenk ( 1990 ) , bonnet ( 1994 ) ] .
conversely , passing through a low density region , the image will become dimmer and elongated radially .
independent perturbations along the line of sight add up stochastically [ blandford 1991(bsbv ) , miralda - escud 1991 , kaiser 1992 , villumsen 1995a(v95a ) ] .
weak lensing by large scale structure is observable because galaxy images near each other on the sky will be sheared coherently leading to a locally preferred direction .
due to the weak nature of the lensing there has been no undisputed measure of the distortion , see f.ex .
( mould 1994 ; kaiser , squires , & broadhurst 1995 ) , though a reanalysis by villumsen ( 1995b ) shows a tentative detection at the 5-@xmath9 level consistent with expectations from a weakly biased flat cold dark matter ( cdm ) universe .
the problem with weak lensing is that it is weak .
measuring the weak shear requires measuring the shape and orientation of distant galaxy images .
this is observationally feasible , but quite difficult , since the images are small and faint , and the possible systematic errors are the limiting factors .
weak gravitational lensing is characterized by the convergence @xmath10 and shear @xmath11 .
we will work only in the weak limit , @xmath12 . in this limit , both @xmath10 and @xmath11 are observables .
the distortion of an image is given by @xmath11 , such that an intrinsically round image will aquire an eccentricity equal to @xmath13 and the phase of @xmath11 will be twice the position angle of the major axis .
the magnification @xmath14 of an image is @xmath15 . in clusters ,
the distortion is used to generate shear maps which can then be converted into maps of the surface density as pioneered by kaiser & squires ( 1993 ) and further developed by seitz & schneider ( 1995 ) . recently
broadhurst , taylor & peacock(1995 ) have demonstrated the use of the magnification to improve the information about the surface mass density .    in this paper
i propose a new measure of weak gravitational lensing by large scale structure based on the magnification bias introduced by turner ( 1980 ) and used by broadhurst ( 1995 ) for lensing in clusters .
basically , weak lensing will induce angular correlations in the number density of galaxies on the sky .
this measure only involves the convergence @xmath10 and does not involve @xmath11 .
thus , it is not necessary to measure the shape of high - redshift galaxies .
this means that a galaxy survey to look for magnification bias can be pushed to fainter magnitudes than a search for galaxy distortions .    in  2
i estimate the amplitudes of `` true '' and `` apparent '' clustering , in  3 i work out the theory . in  4 i calculate @xmath1 in terms of the 3-d correlation function and in  5
i discuss the implications .
magnification bias is the change in surface number density of sources on the sky due to gravitational lensing ( turner 1984 ) . as the total number of galaxies on the sky
is conserved , magnification in a given patch of the sky will lead to a decrease in the number density of galaxies , because you are looking at a smaller area of sky than you think .
however , magnification will also brighten an image so more galaxies will be visible at a given apparent magnitude @xmath16 .
if the number counts @xmath17 in the absence of lensing has a slope s = d n_0(m ) dm , then the number counts will be changed n_obs(m)=n_0(m)a^2.5s-1=n_0(m)(1+(5s-2)),[nobs ] where @xmath18 and @xmath17 are the number counts in the presence / absence of lensing .
the first equality is generally valid , the second assumes that @xmath19 . for @xmath20
there is no magnification bias , for @xmath21 there is a depletion of counts , while for @xmath22 there is an increase in counts in the presence of magnification .    in order to estimate the clustering effects of the `` magnification bias '' , assume a universe with no intrinsic clustering of galaxies .
then weak lensing will introduce an apparent clustering characterized by an angular two - point correlation function @xmath23 & & n_0(m)^2.[wkk ] here the correlation function is calculated as the average over all direction vectors @xmath24 of the relative excess number of galaxy pairs separated by angle @xmath25 .
we obtain from eqs .
( [ nobs],[wkk ] ) & = & n_0(m)^2 + & = & ( 5s-2)^2 ( 5s-2)^2 c_()=(5s-2)^2 c_pp ( ) . here , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 are the correlation functions of the convergence and the shear . in this weak limit
they are identical ( bsbv and v95a ) .
the shear and convergence correlation functions are steeply increasing functions of the comoving angular distance @xmath28 , and thus of redshift @xmath29 . for a universe with @xmath30 , _ c_y^3 = 8(1-(1+z)^-1/2)^3 .
the variation in the number counts to a given magnitude limit across the sky is an observable .
the shear and convergence correlation functions are related to the density distribution and cosmological parameters as described in bsbv , v95a .
the shear @xmath11 will also influence the number counts , but the effect is quadratic in @xmath11 and can be ignored .    in real life
, of course , we observe a true clustering of galaxies at faint magnitudes characterized by the angular two - point correlation function @xmath31 , ( see references in  1 ) . the correlation induced by magnification bias
@xmath23 is of practical interest only if it becomes significant compared to @xmath31 . in a universe where the clustering is constant in comoving coordinates
, @xmath31 will fall off roughly inversely with distance .
lensing is a cumulative effect while the intrinsic three dimensional clustering will be diluted by projection effects .
this would indicate that at low redshift @xmath23 is unimportant but that at sufficiently high redshift @xmath23 might become important .
the observational issue is whether this occurs at observable apparent magnitudes .
the current status of @xmath0 for red samples is summarized by ( bsm ) , see fig .
it is common to characterize the correlation function as a power law with slope @xmath11 and the amplitude at 1 degree , @xmath32 .
then @xmath33 , @xmath6 measured in degrees .
there is a general consensus that @xmath34 and that @xmath32 is a decreasing function of depth .
( bsm ) state that the amplitude from red counts is @xmath35 with @xmath36 .    for a cdm universe where the characteristic redshift of the sources is @xmath37 , the amplitude of the polarization correlation
is given by the cosmological density parameter @xmath38 and the rms density fluctuations on a scale of 800 km @xmath39 , @xmath40 ( bsbv , v95a ) , c_(=5^)1.510 ^ -3_0 ^ 2 _ 8 ^ 2 .
this would indicate that the amplitude of @xmath32 induced by lensing is a_w,210 ^ -4 ( 5s-2)^2_0 ^ 2 _ 8 ^ 2 .
the mould ( 1994 ) , presented in ( bsm ) were obtained in the @xmath41 band where the source counts have @xmath42 . then a_w,(r)510 ^ -5_0
^ 2_8 ^ 2 .
this is lower than the observed value of the correlation function @xmath43 , @xmath44 , but not negligible .
however , we have neglected the correlation between the magnification bias and the true clustering .
if light traces mass , then there will be a strong correlation between the magnification and the true clustering .
if @xmath45 , this is really an anticorrelation and the observed clustering will be less than the true clustering .
smail ( 1995 ) find that the slope in the vri bands all tend to @xmath46 for the faintest galaxies .
neuschaefer ( 1991 ) have reported on @xmath1 in the gunn - g band and they find a slope @xmath47 .
this is close to the critical slope of @xmath20 , so the magnification bias is expected to be small and quite uncertain . for @xmath48
they find that @xmath1 is approximately a power law with the amplitude decreasing with increasing magnitude . for fainter magnitudes
they find a very steep rise in the amplitude .
this rise is much too steep to be accounted for by magnification bias . at @xmath49 , @xmath50 . for a high value of @xmath51 there may be a small contribution to @xmath1 from magnification bias , though this is uncertain
.    however , broadhurst ( 1995 ) has shown that for the @xmath52 band counts , @xmath53 , the red counts , @xmath54 , are fitted well by a slope @xmath55 .
the blue counts , @xmath56 , have @xmath57 .
the prediction is thus that for the blue counts , there will be a measurable magnification bias . for the red counts ,
though , the prediction is that the magnification bias will be strong , a_w,(r)310 ^ -4_0 ^ 2_8 ^ 2 .
this is comparable to the observed correlation function amplitude .
these results indicate that at accessible apparent magnitudes the magnification bias will give a significant contribution to the observed angular two - point correlation function .
this encourages a more detailed study of the magnification bias .
in the limit where the intrinsic clustering and the magnification bias are weak , the clustering , characterized by the angular two - point correlation function @xmath0 can be calculated .
the magnification bias works on the `` true '' number counts , the number counts which include the true clustering , n_obs(m)=n_0(m)(1+)a^2.5s-1n_0(m)(1++(5s-2 ) ) . here
, @xmath58 is the true fractional excess number of sources in a particular patch on the sky . from this
we can calculate @xmath0 from an average over the sky , & = & n_0(m)^2 + & = & + & = & + ( 10s-4 ) + ( 5s-2)^2 + & & + 2 + + & = & + 2+(5s-2)^2 c _
again , the average is over all direction vectors @xmath24 .
the three individual terms are not observables , only the sum .
the first term is the true galaxy clustering , the third term is the apparent clustering induced by the magnification bias , and the second term is a cross correlation .
the magnification bias is induced by mass density fluctuation , while the true galaxy clustering measures the galaxy number density fluctuations .
if in projection , the number density fluctuations are decoupled from the mass density fluctuation , then the cross term will be zero .
the observed number counts of galaxies as a function of magnitude in a given passband and position on the sky will depend in a complicated , and unknown way , on the formation and evolution of galaxies . in the calculations we are going to use the comoving radial distance @xmath59 as fundamental variable , x(z)&=&_0^z dz h^-1(z )  ; h(z)=^1/2 , + y(z)&=&. in a simple model , characterised by a selection function @xmath60 , and linear bias factor @xmath61 we can calculate statistically the surface density distribution .
we define @xmath60 to be the mean comoving number density of observed objects at distance @xmath59 .
the function @xmath62 can also be thought of as a function of redshift , or lookback time .
the normalisation of @xmath62 is such that _
0^dxy^2 s(x)=1 .
[ norms ] the function @xmath62 has hidden in it the number density evolution , the luminosity evolution , and the differential k - correction .
we define the linear bias factor @xmath63 as b(x)=(nn)/ ( ) , so @xmath63 is not a function of scale but can be a function of epoch .
this linear biasing scheme assumes that the galaxies cluster the same way as the mass , just at a possibly different amplitude characterized by @xmath63 .
the surface density fluctuation @xmath58 can then be written as a line integral in comoving radial distance @xmath59 of the fractional volume overdensity @xmath64 times the volume element @xmath65 with a selection function @xmath60 . here
@xmath28 is the comoving angular diameter distance .
( | ) & = & _ 0^ dx y^2 s(x)b(x ) ( ) , + ( |)&=&3_0_0^dx y w(x)()/a . in principle , all the line integrals are only out the horizon distance @xmath66 , however , we can just set @xmath60 equal to zero for @xmath67 .
the equation for @xmath10 is taken from v95a , eq 29 , where @xmath68 . here , @xmath69 is the density perturbation at position @xmath70 evaluated at the epoch when the lightray passes through .
the expansion factor @xmath71 also enters , @xmath72 at the present epoch .
the function @xmath73 is the lensing selection function which for a lens at distance @xmath59 is the integral over all sources @xmath74 further away than @xmath59 of the ratio of the lens - source distance @xmath75 and the observer - source distance @xmath76 .
w(x)=_x^dx y^2 s(x)y_ls y_os for convenience we write @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the density fluctuation evaluated today .
we implicitly assume that the `` growth factor '' @xmath79 is a universal function of expansion factor @xmath80 only .
then ( |)+(5s-2)(|)=_0^dxyf(x ) _ 0 ( ) . [ deltam ]    suppose we have sufficiently well behaved functions @xmath81 , and @xmath82 defined as f(|)_0^x_hdx g(x ) _ 0
( ) . the two - point correlation function @xmath83 of @xmath84 will then be c_ff()=4 ^ 2_0^dx g^2(x)_0^dkkp(k ) j_0(k x ) .
[ ff ] equation [ deltam ] is of this form so we can write the two - point correlation function as & = & 4 ^ 2_0^ dx  y^2  f^2(x)^2 _ 0^dk k p(k ) j_0(kx ) .
[ w1band ]    we see in eq.([w1band ] ) that if @xmath85 , the weak lensing will give a positive contribution to the correlation amplitude , while if @xmath45 , the weak lensing will have a negative contribution to the correlation amplitude .
the weak lensing can change the angular dependence of @xmath1 if @xmath86 is not a power law . on a given angular scale @xmath6 , @xmath1 samples decreasing wavenumbers as a function of @xmath59 as seen in eq.[w1band ] .
the weighting in @xmath87 is given by the outer integral which is changed by the magnification bias .
thus , if @xmath86 is not a power law @xmath1 will be changed by the magnification bias .
at low redshift the intrinsic clustering will dominate and the magnification bias is negligible . at higher redshift , the intrinsic clustering will drop and the magnification bias will increase dramatically . in the case of flat number counts , @xmath45 , the angular two - point correlation function will decrease faster with depth than expected from limber s equation ( peebles 1980 ) .
eventually the contibutions from the true clustering and the magnification will be about equal and the observed clustering amplitude will hit a minimum . at even higher redshift the magnification bias will dominate and @xmath0 will increase .    for steep number counts , @xmath85 , the correlation amplitude will fall slower with apparent magnitude than expected from limber s equation , reach a minimum , and then rise again . in both cases the correlation amplitude will eventually become an increasing function of depth .
the magnitude at which this happens will depend on cosmological parameters , @xmath38 and @xmath63 .
how do the intrinsic correlations and the apparent correlations scale with depth of the sample .
take a simple example where @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath61 is a constant , then @xmath91 . in eq.([w1band ] ) in the outer integral , the contribution from intrinsic clustering will scale inversely with @xmath92 , while the contribution from magnification bias will scale as @xmath93 . in eq .
[ w1band ] the calculation of the intrinsic clustering involves five powers of the distance . as @xmath94 is inversely proportional to the sixth power of the characteristic distance of the sources we have that @xmath31 scales inversely with characteristic distance of the sources .
also in eq .
[ w1band ] we see that @xmath23 scales as the third power of the characteristic distance .
the inner integral in @xmath87 is the same for the two terms , and is proportional to @xmath95 for a power law power spectrum with slope @xmath96
.    we can thus estimate the sample distance at which the magnification bias will dominate .
the correlations induced by weak lensing are approximately @xmath97 while the true angular correlation has @xmath98 .
thus the characteristic distance @xmath99 at which the two effects become comparable is @xmath100 .
the limiting magnitude @xmath2 at which the correlation amplitude is at a minimum is an observable .
if the typical sample redshift is @xmath101 then @xmath102 is determined from the equation .
( m = m_min,=5^ ) ( 1  -  2)10 ^ -3(5s-2)^2 _ 0 ^ 2 _ 8 ^ 2 .
in figure 1 we demonstrate the effects of the magnification bias through a simple model .
assume that @xmath60 is constant out to some distance @xmath103 .
assume that @xmath104 , the bias is independent of epoch .
further assume @xmath88 and @xmath105 . in this model , which should be seen as an illustration only
, we can calculate @xmath106 as a function of mean source redshift @xmath107 , for various values of @xmath4 and @xmath63 .
in all these models the intrinsic clustering is the same .
the solid curve , @xmath20 , is due entirely to the intrinsic clustering , there is no magnification bias .
the uppermost curve , @xmath108 , shows a positive magnification bias and falls off slower than the true clustering . at @xmath109
the observed clustering amplitude is 70% higher than the true amplitude . at higher redshifts @xmath32 is quite flat and at @xmath110 it will begin to rise .
the two curves for @xmath111 , which are appropriate for red samples , originally fall faster than the true correlation . for @xmath112 ,
the less biased model , dotted line , will have a lower amplitude of @xmath32 than the more biased model , while at higher redshifts the opposite is true .
this behavior can be understood as follows .
the magnification bias consists of two terms , @xmath23 which is always a positive contribution and quadratic in @xmath40 , and @xmath113 which is linear in @xmath40 and is negative . at low redshift
the negative linear term dominates while at sufficiently high redshift the positive quadratic term dominates .    for an unbiased population of galaxies with @xmath114 ,
the magnification bias is so strong that the correlation amplitude hits a minimum at @xmath115 and is larger than the true amplitude for @xmath116 .
the curve for @xmath117 , @xmath114 is identical to the curve for @xmath118 , @xmath111 .
if we observe the correlation function @xmath1 for a single limiting magnitude we can not tell what is the intrinsic contribution and what is magnification bias , it is necessary to use a range of limiting magnitudes .
the slope of the number counts @xmath4 is an observable , so if @xmath119 , and the correlation amplitude is decreasing with limiting magnitude , we know that the intrinsic correlation is higher than the observed correlation .
if the amplitude is rising we can not make this inference . if @xmath120 we know that the true correlation is less than the observed correlation .
if an increase in correlation amplitude as a function of limiting magnitude is observed , we see that it is not necessary to invoke a local population of weakly clustered intrinsically faint galaxies .
it is also not necessary to assume that we are seeing a strongly clustered population of distant galaxies .
these models should be seen as an illustration only . in order to properly model the correlation function
we need to consider luminosity evolution , merger history , density evolution , differential k - correction etc .
in particular we need to relate @xmath121 to limiting magnitude .    from figure 1
, we see that if the data at @xmath122 in ( bsm ) is at @xmath123 , there is likely to be a significant contribution from magnification bias in the data .
an equivalent statistic involving two samples can be used .
the number counts of sources selected in two separate ways in the sample field are used .
the ratio of counts in two passbands at magnitudes @xmath124 can be calculated in the case of weak intrinsic clustering of galaxies .
( m_1,m_2,| ) & & n_obs(m_1,|)n_0(m_1)/ n_obs(m_2,| ) n_0(m_2)-1 -1 + & & ( m_1,|)-(m_2,| ) + 5 - 2 .
@xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 are the magnitudes , slopes of the number counts and the convergences in the two passbands .
the convergences need not be identical since the depth of the samples in redshift need not be the same in the two passbands .
equivalently , we can look at two separate samples selected by color , in a single passband .
this statistic in the weak clustering regime is equivalent to the statistic involving the difference in number counts .
( m_1,m_2,| ) & & n_obs(m_1,|)n_0(m_1 ) - n_obs(m_2,| ) n_0(m_2 ) + & = & ( m_1,|)-(m_2,| ) + 5 - 2 .    the correlation function
can then be calculated in a similar fashion to eq .
( [ w1band ] ) & = & 4 ^ 2_0^dxy^2 f^2(x ) ^2 + & & _
0^dkkp(k ) j_0(kx ) .
[ w2band ]    figure 2 shows the correlation amplitude for the same model model as in figure 1 .
here we have assumed two populations with the same selection function @xmath127 , thus @xmath128 .
we have further assumed that @xmath129 and that @xmath130 , @xmath131 .
this means we have strongly and weakly correlated populations .
we show @xmath32 for @xmath132 .
the solid curve is @xmath32 in the absence of magnification bias @xmath133 . for a positive value of @xmath134 the curves are always above the solid curve . at low redshift
there is little magnification bias and the curves all follow the solid curve . for positive
@xmath134 the curves move significantly away from the solid line at @xmath135 and then become nearly flat out to @xmath136 . for negative @xmath137 ,
the curves trace the solid line more closely , but with a significant difference at @xmath135 . for the curves with a substantial difference in
number counts slope , the curves then hit a minimum and then rise steeply .
these curves for negative @xmath134 may be relevant for a strongly clustered red population with small number counts slope and a weakly clustered blue population with a larger value of @xmath4 .
this estimator is most useful when the intrinsic clustering is similar in the two bands , while the slopes of the number counts are very different . in the case where the intrinsic clustering is the same in the two passband , @xmath138
, there is zero contribution from the intrinsic clustering .
if also the depth in comoving distance is similar , then @xmath139 and we get that = 25(s_b - s_r)^2 . [ wratio1 ] this assumption is not as severe as it might seem as can be seen from the following example .
look at two source planes at distances @xmath140 and two lightrays separated by a small angle @xmath141 . a mass fluctuation at distance @xmath59 will coherently influence the convergence in the two beams only if the beams both pass through the density fluctuation .
this is obviously only possible if @xmath142 .
thus density fluctuations beyond the nearest source plane will not influence the correlation , and c__1_2 ( ) c__1_1 ( ) . in that case we have to a good approximation that the observed two point correlation function of the ratio of counts is given by eq .
[ wratio1 ] , which for the ratio of very red and very blue samples gives 3 .
[ wratio2 ]    if at intermediate magnitudes we find that the observed correlation strengths differ by a factor @xmath143 we can use a different estimator of the clustering , ( m_1,m_2,| ) & &  -c + & = & ( m_1,|)-c(m_2,| ) + 5 - 2 .
the correlation function can then be calculated in a similar fashion to eq .
( [ w1band ] ) & = & 4 ^ 2_0^dxy^2 f^2(x ) ^2 + & & _
0^dkkp(k ) j_0(kx ) .
[ w2cband ] by construction , the intrinsic correlations cancel out at intermediate redshift . at higher redshifts
this cancellation may not occur , but this estimator may minimize the effects of the intrinsic clustering even at faint magnitudes .
suppose we have sufficiently well behaved functions @xmath144 , @xmath145 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath148 , and @xmath149 defined as f_1(| ) & & _
0^dx g_1(x ) _ 1 ( )  ; f_2(|)_0^dx g_2(x ) _ 2 ( )  ; f(|)f_1(|)+f_2(| ) .
the two - point correlation function @xmath83 of @xmath84 will then be c_ff()=2_0^dx & & ( g_1 ^ 2(x)_0^dq ^11(((x)^2+q^2)^1/2])+ + & & ( g_2 ^ 2(x)_0^dq ^22)+ + & & ( 2g_1(x)g_2(x)_0^dq ^12 ) , where @xmath150 , @xmath151 , and @xmath152 are the two autocorrelation functions of @xmath146 and @xmath147 and their cross correlation function .
this follows from eq .

let us take some galaxy density distribution @xmath153 and mass density distribution @xmath154 .

[ wx ] here @xmath155 , @xmath156 , and @xmath157 are the galaxy - galaxy , mass - mass , and galaxy - mass correlations evaluated at the appropriate epoch . in the case where @xmath20 , no magnification bias , this reduces to the ordinary limber s equation .
we can rephrase the correlation function calculation as an integral in redshift .
this becomes simply = 2_0^dz & & ( h(z)n^2(z)_0^dq ^gg)+ + & & ( h^-1(z)9_0 ^ 2(5s-2)^2y^2 w^2(z ) ( 1+z)^2_0^dq ^mm)+ + & & ( 6_0(5s-2)y n(z )

let us make life easy and assume that the correlation functions are all power laws , not necessarily with the same slopes and evolution .
for each of them assume that in proper coordinates @xmath41 ( r , z)=(r r_o)^-(1+z)^-(3 + ) . here , the exponents @xmath11 and @xmath162 need not be the same for the correlation functions . even more importantly , the proper correlation lengths @xmath163 need not be the same . with this assumption ^gg()+^mm()+2^gm ( ) . ^gg()&= & r_0^ ^1- _ 0^dzh(z)n^2(z)x^1-(1+z)^-3- , + ^mm()&= & 9_0 ^ 2(5s-2)^2 r_0^ ^1- _ 0^dz
h^-1(z ) w^2(z ) y^2x^1-(1+z)^-1- , + ^gm()&= & 3_0(5s-2 ) r_0^ ^1-_0^dz n(z ) w(z)y x^1-(1+z)^-2- .
the term for the intrinsic clustering @xmath164 reduces to the same result as ( bsm ) , eqs .
( 6,7 ) when taking into account differences in notation .
let us make life even easier for ourselves and assume that @xmath11 is the same for all three correlation functions .
however allow @xmath162 to be different so that @xmath165 , and @xmath166 .
further assume a linear bias model so that today @xmath167 , and @xmath168 .
now @xmath163 is the correlation length of the galaxies .
this simplifies the integral for @xmath1 . &
= & r_0^ ^1- + & & _
0^dzh(z ) ^2 x^1-(1+z)^-3- .
parametrized this way it is possible to do an analysis of @xmath1 in the same way as bsm while including the effects of the magnification bias . for a given magnitude limit ,
assume a cosmological model , @xmath38 , @xmath161 .
then choose @xmath11 , @xmath162 , @xmath169 , @xmath63 , and @xmath163 .
for a given @xmath160 this will then predict the observed @xmath1 .    as stated in bsm , for @xmath170 ,
linear theory predicts that @xmath171 , clustering fixed in comoving coordinates will give @xmath172 , while clustering fixed in proper coordinates will have @xmath173 .
if we have further information about @xmath10 we can improve on our measurements . if we can measure image shapes and position angles , then we can infer the gravitational shear field @xmath174 .
we can then measure the two point correlation function @xmath27 .
in the weak limit , @xmath175 and @xmath176 .
thus we can remove @xmath177 from our measurements .
this leaves us with the true clustering of the galaxies plus the cross term galaxy - mass .
if the observational data is of sufficiently high quality , we can estimate @xmath174 at any given point on the sky .
this estimate is of course smoothed over a finite area .
if we can measure @xmath174 across the sky , we can infer @xmath10 through an inversion procedure such as demonstrated by kaiser & squires ( 1993 ) , or seitz & schneider ( 1995 ) . with these methods
we can obtain an unbiased estimate of @xmath10 .
there is no problem with non - linearities since we are certainly in the weak limit and there is no ambiguity with the mean surface density since it is by assumption zero .
if we know @xmath10 then we simply subtract the term @xmath178 in eq .
we thus retain an unbiased estimate of the true galaxy clustering .    with this measurement
we can thus separate the intrinsic clustering of galaxies , the clustering of the mass , and the galaxy - mass correlation .
in other words we can separate the galaxy clustering evolution from the mass clustering evolution , and we can also measure how well light traces mass .
the standard way of measuring the galaxy number density fluctuations at intermediate redshifts @xmath179 is through the angular two - point correlation function @xmath0 .
measuring @xmath0 is in principle straightforward .
you measure the positions and magnitudes of the galaxies and measure the number of galaxy pairs relative to random .
small distortions in the telescope optics do not influence the results and it is not necessary to measure the shape and orientation of the galaxies .
the interpretation of @xmath0 in terms of the three - dimensional correlation function @xmath180 is complicated through largely unknown luminosity and density evolution .
even if @xmath180 were known accurately , this would only tell us the galaxy distribution , not necessarily the mass distribution .
the mass distribution would then have to be inferred through a model dependent biasing scheme , or some other modeling scheme .
weak lensing by large scale structure is a direct measure of the mass distribution and it circumvents inferring the mass distribution from the galaxy distribution .
the problem with weak lensing is that it is weak .
it requires measuring the shape and orientation of faint galaxy images .
this is observationally feasible , but quite difficult , since the images are small and faint , and the possible systematic errors are the limiting factors .
however , the payoff is immense in terms of measuring cosmological parameters and the power spectrum of density fluctuations .    we have presented a new way of measuring the mass density fluctuations at intermediate redshifts by measuring the angular two - point correlation function @xmath0 . at sufficiently faint magnitudes ,
the observed @xmath0 will be dominated by weak lensing .
the method combines the relative ease at which @xmath0 can be determined , with the relatively simple theoretical interpretation of weak lensing in terms of cosmological parameters and the statistical properties of the mass distribution .    at relatively bright magnitudes , @xmath181 ,
weak lensing is expected to be unimportant .
if the slope of the number counts is greater / less than @xmath182 , the amplitude of @xmath0 will decrease slower / faster than expected from limber s equation .
in both cases the amplitude will hit a minimum and then increase with limiting magnitude .
an equivalent measure is the ratio of number counts in two different passbands as a function of position in the sky .
this measure can , by carefully choosing the passbands and magnitudes , be tuned to be nearly independent of the true clustering of galaxies . in that case
, @xmath1 is a straight measure of weak lensing and the theoretical interpretation is considerably simpler .    in summary : the angular two - point correlation function of galaxies is affected by weak lensing by large scale structure through the magnification bias . at faint magnitudes
this can be a signicant effect and must be included in calculations . for a properly designed experiment , @xmath1 can be used to infer the clustering of the mass , the clustering of the galaxies , and how well light traces mass ." ," weak gravitational lensing by large scale structure affects the number counts of faint galaxies through the `` magnification bias '' and thus affects the measurement of the angular two - point correlation function @xmath0 . at faint magnitudes the clustering amplitude will decrease differently with limiting magnitude than expected from limber s equation . 
 the amplitude will hit a minimum and then rise with limiting magnitude . 
 this behavior occurs because @xmath1 due to clustering decreases with distance , while the `` magnification bias '' due to weak lensing increases with distance . 
 the apparent magnitude @xmath2 at which the magnification bias starts to dominate the observed clustering is model and color dependent . 
 it is given by @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the logarithmic slope of the number counts . 
 already published measurements of @xmath1 at @xmath5 may be strongly influenced by the `` magnification bias '' . 
 an experiment using the ratio of blue and red number counts across the sky can be designed such that the effects of the `` true '' clustering is minimized . 
 the magnification bias is a measurement of the clustering of the mass . 
 this weak lensing experiment does not require measuring shapes and position angles of galaxies . 
 i derive a revised limber s equation including the effects of magnification bias .

"the sudbury neutrino observatory ( sno ) @xcite is a heavy water cherenkov detector located at a depth of 2010 m in inco s creighton mine near sudbury , canada .
the detector uses 1000 tonnes of ultrapure heavy water as a target material contained in a 12 m diameter acrylic sphere to detect solar neutrinos .
an array of @xmath09500 photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) , mounted on a 17.8 m diameter stainless - steel geodesic support structure which is immersed in 7000 tonnes of shielding light water , is used to observe cherenkov photons produced in the d@xmath1o region . in recent studies ,
the sno collaboration has provided strong evidence that neutrinos change flavor as they travel from the sun to earth @xcite , independently of solar model flux predictions .
wavelength shifters are generally fluorescent organic chemicals containing polyaromatic hydrocarbons or heterocycles in their molecules which absorb photons and re - emit them at longer wavelengths .
previous studies have shown that adding wls into cherenkov detectors increases the amount of detected light by a factor of 1.2 using amino g @xcite and by a factor of 3 using umbelliferone @xcite .
1 illustrates why the use of a wavelength shifter is attractive for increasing the light yield in the sno detector .
the cherenkov light production rises strongly in the violet end of the spectrum but this light is lost due to attenuation in 5.5  cm of acrylic at normal incidence .
the addition of wls in the d@xmath1o can boost the cherenkov signal without changing the background photons from outside the d@xmath1o region .
this should significantly increase the detector efficiency and improve the energy resolution of sno which would allow for a better sensitivity of the detector to spectral distortions caused by neutrino interactions with matter in the core of the sun . in this paper
, we studied the viability to introduce wls in the sno detector .
initially , the chemical and optical properties of several wls candidates were tested .
subsequently , a detailed simulation of the sno experiment was performed and a wls cosmic ray telescope was designed to check the response to cherenkov radiation .
even though it was subsequently decided that no wls would be used for a future phase of the sno experiment , we believe the new water based wavelength shifters that have been found in this study may be useful for some future cherenkov detectors and other applications .
to meet the many requirements for the safe and reliable operation of the sno detector , a desirable wls should have the following characteristics : ( 1 ) soluble and stable in water ; ( 2 ) removable from heavy water as the sno d@xmath1o has been loaned by atomic energy of canada limited ( aecl ) and it should be returned additive - free at the end of the sno experimental program ; ( 3 ) no adverse interaction with the materials used in the detector and water circulation system , including acrylic , polypropylene , and mnox beads @xcite and htio absorbent @xcite , which are used for the radium assays of the heavy water ; ( 4 ) high absorbency below 350 nm , and high re - emission probability in the range of 350 - 500 nm with a high quantum efficiency in the neutral ph range , with no significant overlap between the excitation and emission regions ; ( 5 ) to achieve the best light gain , the emission spectrum should match , as closely as possible , the optimal pmt sensitive region ( see fig .
1 ) ; ( 6 ) short fluorescence decay time ( a few nanoseconds ) , as the longer re - emission time would potentially incorporate trigger ambiguity and could also increase the uncertainty in the reconstructed position of the event .
five water - soluble wls compounds were initially tested according to the above criteria .
they included four coumarin derivatives ( 7-hydroxy-4-methylcoumarin , 7-hydroxy-4-methylcoumarin-3-acetic acid , 7-hydroxycoumarin-3-carboxylic acid , and alexa fluor 350 , all commercially available at molecular probes ) and one carbostyril ( carbostyril 124 , purchased from sigma - alderich co. ) .
the results are described as follows .
the results of the optical measurements for all the wavelength shifters are summarized in table 1 .
alexa fluor 350 ( af350 ) and carbostyril 124 ( cs124 ) are ph - insensitive in the neutral ph range , whereas the other three coumarin derivatives show an obvious ph dependence and their absorption shifts to longer wavelengths as the ph values increase from 5 to 11 .
the ph - sensitive coumarins would not be fully deprotonated , and thus would not be very efficient in converting ultraviolet photons , until their ph values rise to above 9 .
the ph value of the sno heavy water is 7 .
consequently , a large amount of buffer needs be added into the detector to alter the water ph if a ph - sensitive wls is chosen .
this is not practical as it would introduce unnecessary materials and greatly increase the risk of contamination .
[ tbl:1 ]    [ cols='<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ ' , ]      +    the simulation procedure was straightforward : 10,000 electrons with an energy of 10  mev were generated isotropically inside the heavy water .
the gain is defined as the ratio of the mean of the number of pmt hits with and without wls . the gain and
the mean free path of cherenkov light in a wls solution are shown in table  2 for different wls concentrations .
at concentration above 0.50  ppm , there was a saturation plateau in the number of detected photons .
therefore , there is no significant advantage in choosing a higher concentration in terms of the number of pmt hits .
however , in order to keep the spatial resolution at a reasonable level and bring the absorption mean free path below 10  cm , the concentration should be higher or equal to 1  ppm . at a few ppm ,
the light gain from the monte carlo simulation is estimated to be 2.9 and 3.0 for the af350 and cs124 , respectively .
finally , the energy thresholds with and without wls were identified by simulating sno data in the pure d@xmath2o configuration .
the simulation incorporated both the solar neutrino signal events and all internal and external low energy backgrounds . in principle , adding a wavelength shifter could allow processes whereby particles below the cherenkov threshold produce light through direct excitation of the wavelength shifter . in a good scintillator ,
the production of light is typically 30,000 photons per mev of incident energy . at a concentration of a few ppm
, we concluded that this is not likely to produce more than a few photons and neglected this effect , even for the naturally occurring alpha particles of several mev .
the result showed a clear shift in the mean number of pmt hit recorded for a typical cherenkov event . at a given statistical significance of the signal over the background for a 5  mev analysis threshold without wls  @xcite ,
the addition of 1  ppm of wls would allow for a 3.7  mev low energy threshold .
in order to test the wls compounds in an actual experiment , an apparatus was built that uses cosmic rays as the source of cherenkov light .
the telescope allows a direct comparison between the cherenkov light produced by cosmic rays and the wls light .
two cylindrical barrels made from polyvinylchloride ( pvc ) are placed one above the other allowing a vertical cosmic ray to go through both , as shown in fig .
3 . three scintillator panels placed on the top , the center and the bottom of the apparatus are used in coincidence to trigger a cosmic ray event .
the top and bottom scintillator panels have larger diameters ( 30 cm ) to maximize the trigger rate , while the middle one is smaller ( 20 cm ) to ensure fully contained events .
two layers of lead bricks with a total thickness of 20 cm are placed above the bottom scintillator panel to eliminate the soft component of the cosmic ray shower in the data .
the two barrels are identical in size , with a height of 42.5  cm and a diameter of 22.9  cm .
they both contain a hermetic sample cell that can either be filled with pure water or a wls solution .
these cells are separated from a hamamatsu r1408 pmt by an ultraviolet transparent ( uvt ) acrylic window , using the same type of pmt and acrylic as in the sno detector .
the sample cells are cylindrical with a diameter of 20.4  cm and a height of 15  cm , for a total volume of 4.9 liters of optical medium .    in order to reduce the variation of gain of the pmts due to their orientation with respect to the earth s magnetic field , a cylindrical envelope of mu - metal shields both pmts from any variation of the magnetic field .
depending on the orientation of the cells ( pmt looking upward or downward ) and the type of optical medium present in each sample cell , it is possible to isolate the proportion of wls light and direct cherenkov light detected by the pmts and perform a light gain measurement .
the cherenkov cone of light always point downward , therefore only a pmt in the upward facing position would detect it , while the isotropically distributed wls light is detected by both downward- and upward - looking pmts .
although many concentrations of different wls candidates would have been possible to analyze with this apparatus , only cs124 at a concentration of 15.4 ppm was tested since it seemed the most promising candidate for its addition to the sno detector .
this concentration is higher than the optimal concentration of a few ppm obtained from the monte carlo analysis for sno @xcite because it was necessary to compensate for the smaller scale of the apparatus .
two types of calibration were performed . since the resolution and sensitivity of the sno pmts allow the detection of a single photon , the first method consists of measuring the charge induced by a single photon hitting the pmt .
thus , the absolute scale of the apparatus was measured and resulted in a good linearity up to a few thousand photons , which is the luminosity expected from a cosmic ray event .
the second method uses the data itself to check if both pmts respond the same way to the cherenkov light as a function of the voltage .
the voltages of the two pmts were adjusted such as to equalize their gains .
such calibration allows consideration of the intrinsic sensitivity of each pmt and any other cell asymmetry .
the wls re - emission time measurement consists of doing a fit of the pmts pulse shape , assuming two gaussianly distributed time components , the direct cherenkov light and the wls light .
the fit of the re - emission time of cs124 gave a value of 6.1  @xmath3  0.5  ns , which is in good agreement with 6.2  @xmath3  0.3  ns found in the fluorescence lifetime measurement using a laser system ( see table  1 ) .
although a more precise measurement would have been possible with a faster data acquisition system and a more sophisticated pulse shape analysis , it was unnecessary since the laser system was faster and easier to operate , and much less susceptible to systematic errors . based on the agreement between the timing measurements performed
, the wls telescope seems to be well calibrated for the gain measurement described in the next section .
depending on the orientation of the cherenkov cell , there are two ways to measure the mean amplitude of pulses with and without wls .
if a wls solution is in the upper cell and water is in the lower cell , only wls light is detected in the first ( @xmath4 ) and only cherenkov light is detected in the second ( @xmath5 ) .
after inverting the configuration , both cherenkov and wls light are detected in the lower cell ( @xmath6 ) , while in the upper cell only the dark noise should be detected ( @xmath7 ) .
based on the ratio @xmath8 between the mean pulse amplitudes of the pmts , an increase of 2.0  @xmath3  0.2 in the number of detected photons was obtained with wls .
the error is dominated by the level of noise in the pmts and some residual asymmetry in the cells .
a fully consistent results is obtained when the gain is computed from @xmath9 .
the main interest of the wls cosmic ray telescope was to perform a light gain measurement and to ultimately determine not only the number of photons detected by the pmts but the total number of photons produced .
since the pmt in a given cell detects only a fraction of the light produced and this fraction is different for cherenkov and wls light , a calculation is required to obtain the increase of photon produced within a @xmath10 solid angle .
the monte carlo method was used for the determination of the wls cosmic ray telescope acceptance and the light gain correction factor .
the simulation generated cherenkov photons , calculated their mean free path in the wls solution and if the interaction point was within the cell volume , it changed the direction of the photon randomly .
it has been found that 61.0% of the cherenkov photons propagating toward the pmt were hitting it , while only 18.1% of the isotropic wls photons ended their path on the pmt .
therefore , adding 15.4 ppm of carbostyril 124 into the wls cosmic ray telescope resulted in a net light gain of of 4.4  @xmath3  0.5 .
the optical and chemical properties of two new water based wavelength shifter ( wls ) molecules , carbostyril 124 ( cs124 ) and alexa fluor 350 ( af350 ) , were tested as candidates to increase the detection efficiency of cherenkov light of the sudbury neutrino observatory ( sno ) .
the tests indicated that these ph - insensitive wls chemicals have strong absorbency below 350 nm and high re - emission probability between 350 - 500 nm with a short fluorescence decay time .
this can significantly boost the cherenkov signals detected by the sno pmts which surround the d@xmath1o region .
their long lifetime stability and good chemical compatibility with the materials used in the sno detector as well as in the heavy water system allow addition of wls with no major modification to the detector .
monte carlo simulations allowed a detailed study of the response of a full - scale solar neutrino experiment to the addition of wls .
it was shown that a 5 ppm concentration of af350 or cs124 would increase the light yield detected by the sno pmts by a factor of 2.9 and 3.0 , respectively .
a cosmic ray telescope was also built to test the wls compounds in a well controlled experimental setup , and an increase of the detected cherenkov light has been found by adding carbostyril 124 . taking into account the geometrical acceptance of the detector , an increase of 4.4  @xmath3
0.5 light yield has been measured .
the measured increase in number of photons obtained with the wls telescope has to be compared with the light gain of 3.0 obtained with the full simulation of sno .
it is important to note that a cherenkov detector with a low sensitivity to ultraviolet light will greatly benefit from the addition of wls .
while a larger light gain is obtained in a small scale detector , where the attenuation is negligible , a reduced increase in the number of detected cherenkov photons is expected if a wavelength shifter would be added in the heavy water of the sudbury neutrino observatory .
ultimately the properties of the wavelength shifter candidates surveyed in this study can be used toward the conceptual design of future water based cherenkov detectors .
the authors would like to thank alex davis , pascal elahi , rachel faust , and christian mallet for their contributions to the experiments .
we wish to thank mark chen and alex wright for the measurements of fluorescence decay time of the wls chemicals using the laser system in the department of physics at queen s university .
this research was supported in canada by the canadian foundation for innovation ( cfi ) , the canada research chair ( crc ) program , and the natural sciences and engineering research council ( nserc ) ." ," the light yield of a water - based cherenkov detector can be significantly improved by adding a wavelength shifter . 
 wavelength shifter ( wls ) molecules absorb ultraviolet photons and re - emit them at longer wavelengths where typical photomultiplier tubes are more sensitive . in this study ,

"in this note we present what we perceive to be an intuitive explanation of the familiar fact that gravity is not a renormalizable quantum field theory . since this is somehow the place where gravity and quantum mechanics clash , we felt that even though this is by now textbook material , some people ( particularly students and postdocs ) , may benefit from its exposition in the way done in this note .
the crux of the argument , which appears e.g. in @xcite , is one line long and here it is : * the very - high energy spectrum of any @xmath0-dimensional quantum field theory is that of a @xmath0-dimensional conformal field theory .
this is not true for gravity . *
the rest of this note is devoted to explaining this short claim .
we felt that real understanding had to go through a crash course in wilsonian renormalization , explaining some facts about conformal field theories and finally pointing out why as a simple consequence of black hole thermodynamics gravity can not be a renormalizable quantum field theory .
the structure of this note is the following .
we start in section [ secren ] by giving a crash course in wilsonian renormalization . in section [ secgrav ]  we discuss the perturbative irrelevance of the gravitational coupling which is the basis for the standard non - renormalization argument . in section [ seccft ]  we discuss some relevant aspects of the density of states in conformal field theory . in section [ secarg ]  we present the argument for the non - renormalizability of gravity , based on black hole entropy considerations .
we conclude in section [ secconc ] .
it turns out to be a fact of nature that the low energy behavior of many systems is largely independent of the details of what goes on in higher energy scales .
for example , you need not worry about feynman diagrams when analyzing the physics of waves in water .
you need not even worry about atoms .
the navier - stokes equations , formulated in the approximation of a continuous medium , are enough .
the actual physical theory describing the molecules and their interaction does creep in through determining various coefficients in the low energy theory ( e.g. the viscosity coefficient ) .
however , once this quantity has been measured one can use the navier - stokes equation to make predictions about the propagation of waves in water and not worry about the underlying theory .
those coarse grained descriptions applicable at low energies are called _ low energy effective field - theories .
_ even though field theory applications in , say , condensed matter , are sometimes referred to as being not - fundamental in contrast to , say , the standard model , a more honest statement is that they are both 
just ' effective descriptions applicable at different energy scales .
the lhc , soon to be turned on at cern , is designed to probe the tev scale where the standard model effectiveness as a low energy description is expected to break down .
the modern theory of renormalization and its application to quantum field theory was pioneered by wilson , fisher , kadanoff and wegner @xcite .
this subject is covered in many textbooks , e.g. @xcite .
the treatment of the rg equations is modelled after polchinski s paper @xcite .
naively , even the simplest quantum field theories ( qft ) are useless because the answer to almost any calculation is infinite .
a standard example is the 1-loop correction to the mass in scalar @xmath1 @xmath2 for some constant @xmath3 .
the reason we got this meaningless answer was the insistence on integrating all the way to infinity in momentum space .
this does not make sense physically because our quantum field theory description is bound to break at some point , if not sooner then definitely in each spacetime point . strictly within quantum field theory
we can excite this degree of freedom to arbitrarily high energies .
but once we add gravity to the game this can no longer be true .
the reason is that when enough energy density is concentrated in a small region in space it will collapse to form a black hole .
] at the planck scale ( @xmath4 . one way to make sense of the theory is to introduce a _
high energy cut off _
scale @xmath5 where we think the theory stops being valid and allow only for momenta smaller than the cut - off to run in the loops .
but having done that , we run into trouble with quantum mechanics , because usually , the regularized theory is no longer unitary ( since we arbitrarily removed part of the phase space to which there was associated a non - zero amplitude . ) we therefore want to imagine a process of removing the cutoff but leaving behind `` something that makes sense . '' a more formal way of describing the goal is the following .
we are probing the system at some energy scale @xmath6 ( namely , incoming momenta in feynman graphs obey @xmath7 ) while keeping in our calculations a uv cutoff @xmath5 ( @xmath8 because at the end of the day we want to send @xmath9 ) if we can make all physical observables at @xmath6 _ independent _ of @xmath5 then we can safely take @xmath9 in practice , it is convenient to parameterize the energy scale using an rg `` time '' parameter flowing towards lower and lower energies @xmath10 and demand that _ changing the cutoff @xmath5 leaves the partition function . ]
_ @xmath11=0.\ ] ] let us see what the consequences of such an analysis are .
we will model here the partition function of a quantum field theory by @xmath12=i[j]/i[0 ] { \rm\ \ where\ } i[j]=\int[d\phi]e^{-\bigl(\mathcal{s}_0+\mathcal{s}_i+\mathcal{s}_j\bigr)}.\ ] ] the action splits into the ( linear ) source term , the ( quadratic ) kinetic term and a general ( polynomial ) interaction term that we write in momentum space as     scalar field theory is naively divergent.,width=6,height=1 ]    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the inverse propagator in momentum space . ] and we include a source function @xmath15 and a smooth cutoff function @xmath16 with specific properties that are explained in the caption of fig .

so as to only excite green functions with low energy .
the quadratic term contains a smooth momentum cutoff function @xmath18 with the property that @xmath19 for @xmath20 and then falls off smoothly ( and exponentially fast ) to zero for @xmath21.,width=5,height=3 ]    we now demand that the partition function remains invariant upon an infinitesimal change of the high energy cutoff scale @xmath5 ( eq .

it now follows from the properties of @xmath27 explained in fig .

[ dennum ]  because it can be pulled out of the path integral .
the remaining two terms do not cancel each other but inspecting eq .
[ waiz ]  we see that they can both be set to zero if we demand @xmath39\bigl\ { \frac{1}{2}\int\frac{d^4p}{(2\pi)^4}\frac{\partial_t\mathcal{k}}{\delta}\frac{\delta}{\delta\phi(p)}\frac{\delta}{\delta\phi(-p)}e^{-(\mathcal{s}_0+\mathcal{s}_j)}\bigr)e^{-\mathcal{s}_i}\\+&e^{-\mathcal{s}_0-\mathcal{s}_j}\partial_t\bigl(e^{-\mathcal{s}_i}\bigr ) \bigr\}=0 \end{split}\ ] ] integrating twice by parts gives @xmath40 eq . [ dtsi ]  describes the infinitesimal change of the interaction lagrangian upon changing the uv cutoff @xmath41 this dependence of the coupling constants on the cutoff is called _ the @xmath42 flow . _
the procedure of decreasing the cutoff on @xmath43 infinitesimally from @xmath5 to @xmath44 is called _ integrating out a `` momentum shell''_. notice that _ no infinities are encountered _ because all the momentum integrals are done in a finite ( actually infinitesimal ) range .
[ dtsi ]  is a generalized version of the heat equation @xmath45 to a space of functions with a non - trivial positive definite bilinear form @xmath46 , so that the laplacian is given by @xmath47 and @xmath48 .
this kind of differential equation is called a `` gradient flow , '' and is characterized by a potential function that _ decreases _ along the flow\mathcal{x}\nabla^2\mathcal{x}$ ] , since eq . [ heat ]  becomes @xmath49 and so @xmath50 which is negative definite .
actually , there is a small error in this derivation because v depends on the scale also through the definition of the generalized laplacian . ] .
erroneously enough , this flow is _ irreversible _ and so the name renormalization _ group _ is unfortunate . for the interaction
lagrangian itself eq .
[ dtsi ]  gives @xmath51 expanding the coupling constants @xmath52 around zero momentum and labelling the whole set by some generalized index @xmath53 eq . [ efors ]  can be summarized by the _ @xmath54 function equations _
@xmath55 which due to the form of eq
. [ efors ]  contains only linear and quadratic terms in the coupling constants @xmath56    let us pause for a quick recap .
starting from a theory defined at the cutoff @xmath5 with a set of _ bare couplings _ we can get the _ same low energy physics _ at some scale @xmath57 when we _ integrate out _ the momentum shell @xmath58 ( i.e. lower the cutoff from @xmath5 to @xmath44 ) provided that we _ change the coupling constants as a function of the energy scale _ according to eq .
[ beta ] . keeping the scale @xmath6 of low energy physics fixed and sending
the high energy cutoff to infinity corresponds to longer and longer rg - flows .
we are thus interested in the asymptotic @xmath59 behavior of eq .
the heart of the argument relies on the simple fact that the asymptotic behavior of `` gradient flows '' is governed by fixed points .
those are the set of values for the parameters where the `` time '' derivative vanishes , so if we start from such a point , we stay there forever .
since the positive function @xmath60 decreases with time , as @xmath59 the limit is either @xmath61 , called _ the trivial fixed point _ , or some @xmath62 , called _ a non - trivial fixed point .
_ non - trivial fixed points are the set of finite ( or zero ) values for the couplings @xmath63 that satisfy @xmath64 .
the easiest example of a non - trivial fixed point is the _ gaussian fixed point _ , or free field theory . by construction ,
non - trivial fixed points correspond to _ scale invariant field theories_. as a matter of fact , most of the interesting lorentz and scale invariant theories , end up having an even larger symmetry group , the _
conformal group_. such quantum field theories are called conformal field theories , or cfts for short .
the trivial fixed point corresponds to an empty theory because when couplings become infinitely large , a low energy experiment can not excite any degree of freedom .
it is very instructive to analyze the rg flow in the vicinity of a fixed point .      linearizing the beta function equations ( eq .
[ beta ] ) around a fixed point @xmath63 , the _ deviations _ away from that fixed point @xmath65 satisfy @xmath66 for some matrix @xmath67 .
when @xmath67 can be diagonalized , the eigenfunctions @xmath68 satisfy ] @xmath69 there are thus 3 kinds of couplings : @xmath70      there are two important features missed by the classical analysis .
* _ marginal operators : _ quantum corrections may show that a coupling that seemed marginal classically is in fact relevant ( like the gauge coupling in qcd ) or is in fact irrelevant ( like in scalar @xmath71 theory ) .
such couplings are called , accordingly , _ marginally relevant _ , or _ marginally irrelevant_. a coupling that remains marginal quantum mechanically ( like the gauge coupling in @xmath72 supersymmetric yang - mills ) is called _ truly marginal_. the existence of a truly marginal coupling signals that there is a continuous family of conformal field theories labelled by the value of a dimensionless parameter . * _ irrelevant operators : _ in the classical analysis they just die away .
in fact we can solve the exact non - linear equation [ beta ]  which remains quadratic in the @xmath14 basis @xmath73 the solution is @xmath74 + given a non - zero @xmath75 with @xmath76 and @xmath77 _ the asymptotic value of the irrelevant parameter is completely determined by the value of the relevant and marginal couplings .
_ it is only the initial value @xmath78 of the irrelevant parameter which gets exponentially washed away .
figure [ fig - flow ]  shows the qualitative features of such a flow in a plane spanned by one relevant and one irrelevant direction .
starting at the cutoff scale @xmath5 with a set of couplings that flow so that near a fixed point there is a non - zero value to any one of the relevant couplings , we will not hit that fixed point . to make sure
we hit the fixed point we need to tune our initial couplings at the cutoff so that when we flow them to the vicinity of that fixed point all the relevant couplings are _ exactly _ zero .
this set of constraints defines the _ critical manifold _ for this fixed point . tuning couplings to be on the critical manifold guarantees approaching a scale invariant behavior at low energies , which is by definition cutoff independent .
this may seem trivial but in fact , is very powerful .
the reason is that in practice , the vicinity of a fixed point will contain a finite and small number of relevant couplings , but an infinite number of irrelevant ones with @xmath79 . ] .
we can thus guarantee having a well defined limit when @xmath80 by fiddling around only with a small number of parameters .
we thus conclude that starting from any bare lagrangian ( uv ) and flowing to low energies ( ir ) using the rg equations , we asymptotically end up either with an empty theory or a conformal field theory .
this gives us a first answer to the question raised above , namely , a non trivial conformal field theory is `` something that makes sense '' you can be left with as an effective low energy description after removing a high energy cutoff .
if this was the end of the story it would not be very satisfying because the theories we find in nature are not scale invariant . in order to remove the cutoff and be left with a _ non_-scale - invariant quantum field theory we need to take a _
double scaling limit_. what this means , is that keeping a fixed low energy scale @xmath6 we send the high energy cutoff @xmath81 simultaneously sending the bare relevant coupling constant closer and closer to the critical surface , in such a way that the limit gives a theory with a finite relevant coupling . to formulate this
more precisely it is useful to change the definition of the rg time ( eq . [ rgt ] ) so that when @xmath82 we are at the low energy scale @xmath6 and sending @xmath80 corresponds to starting the flow at increasingly negative times @xmath83 using that , eq . [ elambdat ]  gives @xmath84 therefore , we can keep a finite size  to be valid , the deviation @xmath14 must be small .
] for the _ relevant _
( i.e. @xmath85 ) coupling @xmath86 at low energies by sending @xmath80 and simultaneously sending the deviation of the bare coupling away from the fixed point @xmath87 .
more generally , starting with a cutoff @xmath5 and @xmath88 relevant ( and marginally relevant ) directions near a fixed point , we can take a double scaling limit after which we are left with a finite length scale @xmath6 and @xmath89 dimensionless parameters .
one relevant coupling was `` traded , and vice versa . ] for a scale '' giving this procedure the name _
dimensional transmutation_. the value of the other @xmath89 relevant couplings encode exactly how we took the limit by fine tuning closer and closer to the critical surface .
the @xmath88 relevant couplings are called _ renormalized couplings .
_    dimensional transmutation is most familiar in marginally relevant couplings .
e.g. for a single marginally relevant parameter only the quadratic piece from eq .
[ beta ]  can contribute so the deviations from the fixed point obey @xmath90 ( instead of eq .
[ elambdat ] ) , and the solution is by @xmath91 so as to conform with familiar formulae where the fixed point is free field theory . note that solving for the scales in terms of the couplings eq .
[ dimtrm ]  gives the familiar non - perturbative expression @xmath92 . ]
@xmath93 where we can again keep @xmath94 finite by sending @xmath95 in a correlated way to that in which we send @xmath9          while conformal field theories
are few and far between in the space of all possible quantum field theories , they are in this sense the `` backbone '' defining all other quantum field theories .
a `` renormalizable '' quantum field theory , describing the physics at an energy scale @xmath6 , is a perturbation of a conformal field theory by some of its relevant operators with finite size couplings at that scale .
for example , massive scalar field theory in 4 dimensions @xmath96 is a perturbation by the relevant operator @xmath97 of the gaussian fixed point .
similarly , pure qcd is a perturbation of the gaussian fixed point @xmath98 by the marginally relevant coupling that follows from the gauge invariant kinetic terms @xmath99 the values of the renormalizable couplings can not be deduced from the bare lagrangian because their value depends on the arbitrary way one chooses to remove the cutoff .
luckily , in many interesting cases there is just a finite and small number of relevant parameters which now encode _ all _ the physics of the theory at energy scale @xmath6 , including the values of the irrelevant couplings , as was explained after eq .
[ nonsol ] . having measured this finite number of couplings in the laboratory we can make unique predictions about any experiment done in the energy scale @xmath6 and remain ignorant about the information encoded in ( potentially infinitely many ) irrelevant couplings .
this then gives a quantitative justification to the theme advocated in the introduction , namely , the fantastic organizing principle whereby phenomenon in one energy scale are `` shielded off '' from the abyss of their own microscopic substructure .    in principle , it makes no difference what cutoff one uses and how one chooses to remove it .
this important principle is called _
universality_. for instance one can choose a sharp momentum cutoff by refusing to continue the integration of momenta beyond @xmath5 , or a smooth cutoff as was done in this note .
other ways include replacing space by a lattice with spacing @xmath100 , or taking advantage of the analytic structure of the scattering amplitudes by using dimensional regularization .
these are different `` renormalization schemes '' which are just different ways of _ parameterizing _ the relevant and marginal couplings , but the physics is only dictated by the fixed point around which one is perturbing .      .
a uv fixed point ( e.g. @xmath101 ) is perturbed by a relevant operator ( e.g. @xmath102 ) .
flowing further to lower energies it will eventually hit another fixed point , the ir cft ( in this e.g. it is the trivial fixed point @xmath103 as can be seen in eq .
[ ems ] . ) .
point ( b ) , on the other hand , corresponds to a `` non - renormalizable '' qft . adding a non - zero coupling to
an irrelevant operator shoots us away from the uv fixed point we naively thought we were perturbing.,width=3,height=5 ]    given a renormalizable quantum field theory ( point ( a ) in fig .
[ fig - uvir ] ) , we can run the rg flow _ backwards _
( i.e. towards higher energies ) where the relevant coupling vanishes . flowing further to low energies we will eventually hit another fixed point , the ir conformal field theory . but what happens when we attempt to add a finite size coupling to an irrelevant operator at the scale @xmath6 ( point ( b ) in fig .
[ fig - uvir ] ) and then attempt to run the rg flow backwards ? as can be seen in fig .
[ fig - uvir ]  we get kicked off away from the uv fixed point , the irrelevant couplings want to grow without bound .
this is a signal that we are doing something wrong .
going back to the limiting process of removing the cutoff that defines a consistent unitary quantum field theory we realize that we _ can not _ consistently remove the cutoff _ and _ retain a finite size for an irrelevant coupling at low energies .
technically we can inspect eq .
[ dimtrr ]  with @xmath104 and observe that keep a finite @xmath105 when @xmath80 those couplings need to grow without bound .
the result of the calculation is meaningless , exactly as we now understand it should be , because we are trying to retrieve information that was lost in the irreversible gradient flow during the limiting process that is the basis for a consistent definition of any quantum field theory by zero is irreversible because the answer tells you nothing about @xmath106 . dividing by zero is like insisting on `` undoing '' it , hence the ambiguous answer . also here
the correct answer involves a more careful treatment of the limit , which sometimes does and other times does not exist . ] .      before turning our attention to a particular lagrangian , the einstein - hilbert lagrangian of general relativity
, we want to make a few remarks :    * * path integrals and the gaussian fixed point . *
the derivation of the path integral formula in quantum mechanics of a massive particle involves chopping up the quantum evolution into very short time intervals and inserting complete sets of states between them .
the transition amplitude between neighboring spacetime points is @xmath107 ^ 2-v\bigl(\frac{(x_n+x_{n-1})}{2}\bigr)\bigr ) } \end{split}\ ] ] which is dominated by free propagation in the limit @xmath108 because in quantum mechanics short times are associated with high energy ( via the dimensionful constant @xmath109 ) , we can rephrase the last sentence in the language of renormalization , where it reads that the uv fixed point is free .
more generally , only quantum field theories that are perturbations of the gaussian fixed point can be accurately formulated as a path integral .
it is an interesting fact that all the quantum field theories useful to date in describing physical reality share this property . * * generality of rg equations . *
even though the rg equations were derived here using a simple scalar field theory path integral , this derivation is quite general .
its relevance extends to non - trivial fixed points because to most of those one can get by starting from a gaussian fixed point and flowing down the rg trajectory .
+ there are possible caveats to deriving the fixed point behavior as a rigorous theorem .
one has to do with theories that include fermions , because arguments about the positivity of the inner product would fail .
another has to do with gauge theories where it may not be possible to implement a gauge invariant cutoff and define the cutoff theory using a path integral .
there are various arguments suggesting that those are technical issues and the general picture advocated here still holds ( see e.g. @xcite ) . * * dimensionality of spacetime . *
renormalization theory depends in an interesting way on the dimension of spacetime .
e.g , in the theory of a single scalar field in @xmath110 the only relevant interaction of the gaussian fixed point is a mass term . in 2 dimensions
there are infinitely many marginal operators because @xmath111 is of dimension zero . in 1 spacetime dimension ( i.e. quantum mechanics )
there are infinitely many relevant operators .
in fact any function @xmath112 is a relevant perturbation .
this is the reason that the problems of renormalization did not appear in the old days of quantum mechanics .
* * irrelevant interactions . * here we chose to focus on a rigorous removal of the cutoff and thus the inconsistency of finite size irrelevant operators at low energies . however , in practice , irrelevant operators are very useful as a tool in a low energy effective field theory , as long as one is not pretending that they are valid all the way to infinite energies .
in fact , the _ dimensionful _ couplings suppressing irrelevant operators are an indication of the scale where the low energy effective description breaks down .
marginally - irrelevant operators in particular , since they run only logarithmically with the cutoff ( eq . [ dimtrm ] ) , may indicate new physics only at exponentially high energies , where the validity of the theory is in any case expected to break down gauge interaction is marginally - irrelevant , but that does not really matter because the energy scale where the theory is expected to break down is much higher than , say , the electroweak symmetry breaking scale , where qed is anyways incorporated into a larger theory . ] . * * condensed matter . * the language , as well as much of the intuition in the theory of renormalization in quantum field theory is borrowed from the theory of second order phase transitions in condensed matter physics .
the einstein - hilbert action @xmath113\ ] ] governing the dynamics of classical gr was arrived at via a symmetry principle , that of general coordinate invariance . in this respect
it is very similar to the gauge theories one encounters in the standard model . using the defining property @xmath114
we see that the metric is dimensionless .
therefore @xmath115 is of mass dimension 1 and the lagrangian density @xmath116 is of mass dimension 2 .
thus , the scaling dimension ( with energy ) of newton s constant is @xmath117_e=2-d\ ] ] it is customary to define @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the d - dimensional _ planck length_.
this looks similar to a gauge theory action @xmath120 where @xmath121 plays the role of the coupling constant .
indeed , we may choose the dynamical variable to be the metric and expand around flat space by defining @xmath122 , the first non - vanishing contributions are schematically given by @xmath123\ ] ] rescaling @xmath124 in a way similar to the rescaling of the gauge field in ordinary gauge theory , we get @xmath125\ ] ] which looks like a perturbation of the gaussian fixed point @xmath126 .
classically , this is fine , and means that gravity becomes free at large distances .
but quantum mechanically we observe that for @xmath127 the _ gravitational interaction is irrelevant_. the previous discussion has shown that having a finite size for an irrelevant parameter at some energy scale @xmath6 is nonsensical quantum mechanically , unless we view the action ( here eq .
[ eh ] ) as a low energy field theory approximation of something else . for instance
, taking too literally a path integral representation for the partition function in gravity , something like @xmath128e^{-\int\sqrt{g}\mathcal{r}[g]},$ ] can not make sense because path integrals are by definition descriptions of quantum field theories that are perturbations by relevant operators of gaussian fixed points .    trying to solve the problem by avoiding lagrangians all together will not help . in a hamiltonian formulation the same problem of non - renormalizability , which technically appears in lagrangian theories as the need for infinitely many counter terms , creeps in through the back door .
there the hamiltonian constraints , needed for a consistent quantum mechanical treatment of a theory with a gauge symmetry , do not close . attempting to close the constraint algebra by adding the `` right hand side '' as an additional constraint just leads to new terms and so on .      at this point in the discussion it still appears to be possible that there is another , non - trivial
uv fixed point to which gr is a perturbation by a relevant operator .
this scenario was dubbed `` asymptotic safety '' by weinberg @xcite and is reviewed e.g. in @xcite ( for a recent attempt in this direction see e.g. @xcite ) .
if that was the case then general relativity is a renormalizable quantum field theory and we were deceived by using perturbation theory in the wrong variables . in the next sections we explain why this can not be the case .
the conformal group can be defined as the group of coordinate transformations preserving the form of the metric up to a scale factor @xmath129 it is an extension of the poincare group that includes scale transformation ( dilatation ) @xmath130 the conformal symmetry algebra in @xmath0 dimensional lorentzian space is isomorphic to @xmath131 .
since the dilatation operator does not commute with the momentum 4-vector @xmath132 we can no longer characterize a representation of the conformal algebra by the mass operator @xmath133 which is a casimir of the poincare group . for a field that is an eigenfunction of the dilatation operator @xmath134 , the eigenvalue that appeared in the discussion following eq .
[ elambdat ] . ]
@xmath14 is called the  scaling dimension ' .
two convenient ways to label states in a conformal field theory are to decompose the @xmath131 into two different maximal subgroups :    * \1 .
@xmath135 in this case the @xmath136 are lorentz transformations in @xmath0 dimensions and @xmath137 corresponds to dilatations .
fields are labelled by their lorentz representation and scaling dimension @xmath14 . *
@xmath138 this is a quantization on @xmath139 ( the temporal direction is the universal cover of the @xmath140 component ) .
it is the natural choice in the operator formalism which makes a distinction between space and time . in this decomposition fields
are labelled by their energy @xmath141 ( the eigenvalue under @xmath140 translations , not to be confused with the time direction in @xmath142 ) , and by spin quantum numbers associated with the sphere .
the two choices are related by the conformal symmetry .
starting from @xmath139 and continuing to euclidean signature the metric is @xmath143 ( with @xmath144 being the radius of the sphere ) .
this is conformally equivalent to the metric on the euclidean plane @xmath145 if we set @xmath146 . from this relation
we see that the hamiltonian @xmath147 on @xmath139 maps to the dilatation operator @xmath148 on @xmath142 .
the relation between the quantum numbers is given by @xmath149 .
conformal invariance substantially simplifies some aspects of finite temperature field theory . since the zero temperature field theory has no dimensionful scales in itself the temperature sets the scale for all dimensionful quantities .
using dimensional analysis and the extensivity of the energy and the entropy in @xmath0 spacetime dimensions it follows that in any conformal field theory the energy ( on @xmath139 ) and entropy obey @xmath150 where @xmath151 are some numerical coefficients . solving for the entropy as a function of the energy one gets @xmath152 in the next section we compare this with the high energy spectrum of gravity .
as was thoroughly explained in the first part of this note , if general relativity was a renormalizable quantum field theory then its extreme high energy behavior should be that of a conformal field theory in the appropriate number of dimensions .
however , our experience with gravity has shown that once enough energy is concentrated in a given region a black hole will form . as far as our understanding goes , the high energy spectrum of gr is dominated by black holes .
more technically , it is expected that in theories of gravity , black holes will provide the dominant contribution to the large energy asymptotics of the density of states as a function of the energy .    in asymptotically flat @xmath0 dimensional spacetime
there is a black hole solution generalizing the schwarzschild solution @xmath153 where @xmath154 and @xmath155 is the ( adm ) energy of the black hole state .
the horizon is thus at @xmath156 and the entropy as a function of the energy is given by the bekenstein - hawking formula @xmath157 where @xmath158 is the volume of the horizon and @xmath119 is the d - dimensional planck length .
in this case @xmath159 in contrast  is bigger than one , rendering the specific heat negative which reflects the thermodynamical instability of schwarzschild black holes .
in contrast , the exponent in eq . [ cfts ]  is smaller than one , resulting in a positive specific heat . ] to eq .
it therefore follows that the large energy asymptotics of the density of states in a theory of gravity in asymptotically flat spacetime is not that of any conformal field theory , and therefore , it is not a renormalizable quantum field theory .
asymptotically anti de sitter ( ads ) space ( the maximally symmetric solution to einstein s equations with a _ negative _ cosmological constant @xmath160 ) also admits black hole solutions of the form @xmath161 but in this case the function is @xmath162 at distances much smaller than the ads curvature radius @xmath163 this is almost the schwarzschild solution ( eq .[grn ] ) , but asymptotically it is very different .
the horizon is at the larger solution to @xmath164 .
asymptotically @xmath165 the horizon sits at @xmath166 so that the entropy is @xmath167 therefore , in this case @xmath168 .
again , comparing this with eq .
[ cfts ]  the conclusion is that gravity in @xmath0-dimensional ads spacetime does not have the correct density of states for a @xmath169dimensions conformal field theory and so can not be a renormalizable quantum field theory in that sense .
however , there is a surprise here .
. [ adsbh ] , gives the correct dependence for a conformal field theory _ but in one less spacetime dimension_. this is a consequence of the ads / cft correspondence @xcite  which claims a complete equivalence , or duality , between quantum gravity in ads space and a conformal field theory ( without gravity ) defined , in a precise sense that will not be explained here , on the boundary of the ads space .
ads / cft itself is a manifestation of a modern guiding principle in quantum gravity called `` holography '' @xcite .
the case of de sitter space ( the maximally symmetric solution to einstein s equations with a _ positive _ cosmological constant ) , which seems to be the one relevant for our universe is much less well understood .
for once , it is not compatible with supersymmetry which was a main tool in the advancement of our understanding in other cases .
there are reasons to suspect that quantum gravity in ds space may not exist in its own right , perhaps only as a meta - stable state in another theory@xcite .
in this note we tried to give a concise and hopefully intuitive explanation to the fact that gravity is not a renormalizable quantum field theory .
the basic reason is that the asymptotic density of states in gravity is dominated by black holes .
this leads to a behavior qualitatively different from all quantum field theories .
a concern that was repeatedly raised after the appearance of the first version of this note is that the black hole argument is an artifact of the low energy approximation , so that  strongly coupled gravity ' has no black - holes and therefore may still be asymptotically safe .
we believe this counter - argument does not hold because the asymptotic safety scenario is based on the assumption that gravity is a valid low energy approximation to some putative local quantum field theory . therefore at least in its regime of validity it should be trusted .
in particular it should be trusted to describe the horizons of large black holes , since as can be seen from eq .
[ grn ] the _ more _ massive a black hole is , the _ lower _ is the curvature at the horizon .
but the bekenstein - hawking formula tells us that the density of states deduced from this valid approximation has a feature that is clearly in contradiction with any quantum field theory .
therefore , to argue against the non - renormalizability of gravity is really to argue against the validity of the bekenstein - hawking formula , which is an uphill battle .
this is so much more so when taking into account the ads / cft correspondence which verifies the bekenstein - hawking entropy counting in the case of asymptotically ads space , and presents a clear counter example to the idea that quantum gravity is a non - trivial fixed point .

 the argument is based on black - hole domination of the high energy spectrum of gravity and not on the standard perturbative irrelevance of the gravitational coupling . 
 this is a pedagogical note , containing textbook material that is widely appreciated by experts and is by no means original . "
"uncorrelated variations of brightness in the images of a distant source , splitted by the gravitational field of the lensing galaxy are indicative of microlensing events . the phenomenon is clearly seen , e.g. , in q2237 + 0305 , which is known to consist of four lensed quasar images within a 1-arcsec radius circle around the center of the lensing galaxy .
the uncorrelated brightness variations of these images indicate that the effects of microlenses are mainly observed , but not the intrinsic quasar brightness variations .
because of significant difficulties of theoretic analysis , microlensing phenomena are investigated mostly with numerical methods .
a standard procedure for numerical simulation consists in the following .
the effect of all microlenses , randomly distributed inside the galaxy , is described in a twofold manner .
the microlenses , which are the most close ones to the observed image of the source , are specified with their actual deflection angles . the number of such microlenses is not expected to be larger than several hundreds , ( paczynski 1986 ; seitz & schneider 1994 ; blandford & narayan 1992 ) . the rest of microlenses , which are far from the line of sight , as well as the smoothly distributed matter ,
are specified by introducing a deflection angle , averaged over the interstellar space . the further simplification of the problem is due to linearization of the mean deflection angle of the macrolens near a selected lensed image , ( seitz & schneider 1994 ; blandford & narayan 1992 ; schneider et al .
the procedure of the local simplification works well for isolated source images , which are essentially far from the macrolens critical curve .
it is of interest , however , to investigate also an overall interaction of macro and microlenses for the lensing galaxy as a whole .
therewith , a possibility appears to follow the changes of spatial density of microcaustics , and the velocities of their displacement depending on their location with respect to the critical curve of the macrolens . in these cases , typical spatial and temporal scales of microfocusings substantially differ from those obtained with the linearized approach .
the analysis is of a particular importance in studying microlensing by a star , which is in its turn surrounded by a large amount of planetary - mass objects .
such a complex gl will be further considered as a system of macro - milli - microlenses .
in addition to spatial redistribution of brightness in the apparent images , complex deformations of their light curves also take place in gravitational lensing of sources , which are extended in space and variable in time .
the amount of the deformation depends not only on the parameters of the gl ,  mass distribution in the lens ,  but on the parameters of the source as well , such as the emitting region dimension , its location with respect to the critical curve , and on duration of the source brightness spikes .
the amount of light curve deformations turned out to be different for different lensed images .
gl can be regarded as a multi - channel filter , which passes slow brightness variations and smoothes rapid ones .
the aim of this work was to analyze theoretically and simulate numerically the structures of critical curves and caustics of complex gravitational lenses , which consist of macro- and microlenses , for various locations of microlenses with respect to the macrolens critical curve .
also , peculiarities of gravitational focusing of the source with the arbitrarily distributed masses were investigated for the case , when the source is extended in space and variable in time . to obtain numerical estimates ,
the results were applied to the einstein cross q2237 + 0305 .
a complex gl can be presented as a sum of two constituents , with one of them being due to the masses , contained in compact objects , such as stars , star - like and planet - like bodies , and the second one , connected with a diffuse matter , such as dusty and dusty - gazeous clouds .
compact objects , referred to as microlenses ( or millilenses ) hereafter , can be defined as point masses @xmath0 .
a total amount of microlenses @xmath1 in the lensing galaxy is sufficiently large .
for example , @xmath2 for a spiral galaxy similar to q2237 + 0305 .
the effect of microlensing was at first analyzed for a single microlens , and the results were then generalized to the case of many microlenses .
let us introduce a cartesian coordinate system @xmath3 with the origin in the galaxy center of masses , and the @xmath4 axis crossing the point of observations , ( fig .
1 ) . let @xmath5 and @xmath6 be the distances between the gl , the observer @xmath7 and the source @xmath8 , respectively . since @xmath5 and @xmath6 are much larger than the size of the region , where the light beams undergo deflection , we consider the gl as a thin phase screen , ( bliokh & minakov , 1989 ) , which is superposed with the @xmath9 plane .
having selected a single microlens from a totality of @xmath10 microlenses , located at the lens plane and characterized by the impact parameter @xmath11 , we have for the deflection angle at the lens plane , ( @xmath9 ) :    @xmath12    here , @xmath13 is the angle of observation , @xmath14 a coordinate and @xmath15 a gravitational radius of the i - th microlens , @xmath16 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath17 is the velocity of light .
@xmath18 is a component vector of the deflection angle , connected with the diffusely distributed matter . supposing a multidimensional distribution function of random quantities @xmath19 and a distribution law for the diffuse matter in the galaxy to be known , one
can obtain the average defection angle @xmath20 and the variance @xmath21 from eq . 1 , ( see e.g. , bliokh & minakov 1989 , schneider et al .
1992 ) .    the gl with the average deflection angle @xmath20 is called a regular lens , or a macrolens .
the approximation suits a gl , which has the densities of stellar masses and diffuse matter `` smeared '' over sufficiently large regions of the interstellar space .
consider a `` small '' region of space , located near the @xmath22 microlens , which has the size , from one hand , small enough as compared to the typical interstellar distance @xmath23 in the particular region , and from the other hand , is larger than or comparable to the characteristic angular size of the einstein ring @xmath24 for the given microlens , @xmath25 accounting for the smallness of the rms deflection angle ( bliokh & minakov 1989 , schneider et al .
1992 ) , one can easily show , that in fact , the second and the third addends in eg.(1 ) do not differ from the mean deflection angle @xmath26    with all the above noted taken into account , the equation of the complex lens can be written as : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the actual location of the `` point '' source , and @xmath29    the lens equation can be better written in normalized quantities @xmath30 it is convenient to determine the normalizing angle @xmath31 as the angular radius of the einstein ring , which would be observed for the given macrolens , provided it did not contain an asymmetric constituent of the mass distribution . in the normalized quantities ,
the equation of lens ( 2 ) can be presented as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a constituent , connected with the macrolens galaxy , and @xmath34 is a small parameter , that is approximately equal to the ratio of the microlens mass to the total mass of the galaxy .
the gravitational lens system q2237 + 0305 was selected as an example , for which various models of mass distribution are known , ( see , e.g. , kent & falco 1988 , minakov & shalyapin 1991 , wambsganss & webster 1997 ) . basing on the observational data , let us choose the model to be simple enough , but in such a way , that it would be able to produce the observed cross - shaped structure .
let the regular constituent of the deflection angle @xmath35 be presented as a sum of two terms , with one of them , @xmath36 being connected with a massive disc , and the other one , @xmath37 ,  with a compact nucleus .
to simplify the analysis , suppose the nucleus and the disc are spherically and elliptically symmetric , respectively , with their centers coinciding .
superpose the directions of @xmath38 and @xmath39 axes with the axes of symmetry of the disc component . since the typical scale for changing the surface density of the disc component in q2237 + 0305 exceeds noticeably the region , where four quasar components are observed , - about 2 , - one may use the following approximation for @xmath36 near the center of the galaxy : @xmath40 where @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are unit vectors of the cartesian coordinate system .
having supposed characteristic size of the galaxy compact nucleus to be smaller than the region , where the four images are observed , let us approximate the spherical component by a point mass , equal to the mass of the galaxy nucleus @xmath44 . with the accepted simplifications and suggestions , and having in mind , that for the chosen model of the disc @xmath45 the regular component of the macrolens equation can be brought to a form , ( minakov & shalyapin 1991 ) : @xmath46 here , @xmath47 is a dimensionless parameter that determines the amount of asymmetry , introduced by the disc component near the galaxy center . for the q2237 + 0305 model ,
the normalizing angle @xmath48 @xmath49 can be estimated to be @xmath50 , and the asymmetry parameter can be selected equal to @xmath51 therefore , the inequality @xmath52 holds .
the equation of the critical curve of a gl @xmath53 is obtained from the condition that jacobian of transformation from variables @xmath54 to variables @xmath55 is equal to zero : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the amplification factor .
if we substitute the solution of @xmath58 , found from ( 5 ) , to the initial lens equation ( 3 ) , we will obtain the equation of caustic in the source plane : @xmath59 as the first step of the further analysis , let us determine the critical curve @xmath60 and caustic @xmath61 of the macrolens , having supposed @xmath62 in eq .
( 3 ) . for example , for the model ( 4 ) in the polar coordinates @xmath63 in a linear approximation with respect to a small parameter @xmath47 , we have : @xmath64 with the azimuth angle counted off the @xmath65 axis .
the equation of caustic of the regular gl in the source plane in the same approximation is : @xmath66 the model of a regular gl under consideration is seen to produce an oval critical curve in the lens plane , with an approximately unit average radius , - @xmath67 while the corresponding caustic curve in the source plane is diamond - shaped , with the typical size of @xmath68 it can be easily shown , that four images will emerge in projection of the point source @xmath8 inside the diamond caustics ( 8) , with two images outside the critical curve , and two ones inside the curve ( 7 ) in the lens plane , ( see , e.g. minakov & shalyapin 1991 ) .
because of smallness of @xmath47 , the images are located close to the critical curve ( 7 ) .
regarding the equations of the macrolens critical curve and caustic to be known , one may investigate deformations of the curves for various locations of a microlens @xmath69 with a specified parameter @xmath49 .
a simple method was applied to numerically solve eq.(5 ) .
the problem of finding the roots of equation @xmath70 can be substituted by a more simple one .
thus , it is easy to numerically determine the regions of positive , @xmath71 and negative , @xmath72 values of @xmath73 excluding singularities , connected with the point mass approximation , the problem is reduced to determining the boundary between the positive and negative values of @xmath73 the simulation has shown , that a behavior of critical curves and the relevant caustics of a complex gl depends not only on the distance between a microlens and the critical curve of a regular gl , but also on the sector , where the microlens moves .
critical curves and caustics for the q2237 + 0305 model were calculated for different locations of the microlens , - inside and outside the critical curve of the regular gl , and exactly in it ,  and are shown in fig .
3a , b , c . the cases of the microlens displacement along the @xmath65 and @xmath74 axes were examined .
to ensure better view of macro- and microcurves behavior in the same picture , a sufficiently large value for @xmath75 was selected , @xmath76 the curves for @xmath77 will be also presented below .    for a microlens outside the critical curve of a regular gl , 
fig.2a , @xmath78 region ,  the curve @xmath53 consists of two closed curves .
one of them is a slightly deformed macrolens critical curve @xmath79 , and the other one appears around the microlens .
the similar behavior of the critical curve of a complex gl is observed also when the microlens is inside the critical curve of a regular macrolens ,  fig .
2b , @xmath80 in contrast to the case 2a , however , the microlens critical curve is not a single deformed oval around the microlens ( einstein `` ring '' ) , but consists of two closed curves on either side of the microlens . the most interesting case , when the microlens is situated right at the macrolens critical curve , is shown in fig.2c .
the critical curves of macro- and microlenses merge into a joint continuous curve in this case .
a numerical analysis allows to clearly demonstrate a complex deformation of critical and caustic curves , but mathematic analysis is needed to obtain qantitative estimates of the expected effects , that would make it possible to follow their dependence on the model parameters . determining of the real roots of eq.(5 ) for the given values of displacement @xmath69 and parameter @xmath81 is the major task of the analytic investigation .
the following conclusions have been made in the present theoretic analysis , applied to a particular case of q2237 + 0305 , ( minakov & vakulik 2000 ) :    * a microlens distorts a critical curve @xmath79 and caustic @xmath82 of a regular gl .
the amount of deformation is proportional to @xmath49 and decreases rapidly as the distance between the microlens and the macrolens critical curve is growing , see fig .
3 . since rather large number of microlenses may be present near the critical curve simultaneously , their joint effect will cause `` blurring '' of boundaries of the critical curve and caustic of the macrolens . in fig .
4 , the structure of critical curves and caustics for q2237 + 0305 is shown for the case of three hundred microlenses , located near the @xmath79 . *
a structure and behavior of critical curves near the microlens depends not only on the distance to the critical curve of the regular gl , but on the sector of angles as well .
characteristic dimensions of critical curves and caustics are proportional to @xmath83 * the strongest deformation of critical curves and caustics , proportional to @xmath84 is observed when microlenses are situated very close to the critical curve of the regular gl . the curves for macro- and microlenses merge together to form complex continuous curves . *
the difference between the results , obtained with the proposed approach and those of the linear approximation is the larger the closer a microlens to the critical curve , as can be seen from fig .
the effect of interacting microlenses increases noticeably in their approaching the critical curve of a regular gl . *
if even microlenses are distributed homogeneously , spatial distribution of their microcaustics is substantially inhomogeneous near the macrocaustic , see fig .
such an inhomogeneity results in spatial scale of microlensing being dependent on the macroimage location with respect to the macrolens critical curve .    the theoretic analysis and the obtained estimates are capable of examining more complicated situations as well .
suppose , for example , that a complex gl system consists of a macrolens galaxy , millilens star , with the mass of order of @xmath85 , and of a large number of microlenses , 
planetary bodies with the masses of @xmath86 .
if a millilens is situated far from the critical curve of the macrolens galaxy , the effect of focusing can be more easily analyzed in the coordinate system superposed with the millilens . in doing so
, the gravitational field of the galaxy may be considered in the linear approximation , while the effect of microlenses , randomly distributed around the millilens , should be considered in the way similar to that described above .
it is only necessary to renormalize the angles to the quantity @xmath87 , corresponding to the einstein ring of the millilens .
the parameter @xmath88 will be proportional to the ratio of the mass of the @xmath89-th microlens to the mass of the millilens .
a complicated redistribution of brightness in the observed image takes place in gravitational focusing .
if parameters of the source and the lens do not change in time , the brightness distribution @xmath90 observed through the gl is related to the actual source brightness distribution @xmath91 by a convolution - like formula , ( bliokh & minakov 1989 ) : @xmath92 d\vec\psi_s.\ ] ] here , @xmath93 $ ] is the delta - function .
the formula represents mathematically the property inherent in all the nonabsorbing lenses to remain the brightness along a particular light ray unchanged .    several compact bright images ( macroimages ) , separated by a few arcseconds
are usually observed in actual gravitational lenses .
the macroimages have dimensions approximately coinsiding with those of the source emitting regions .
for example , they are about @xmath94 arcseconds for quasars in optical wavelegths . for radio wavelengths , angular dimensions of macroimages may be several orders of magnitude larger .
contemporary instruments ,  telescopes , radio telescopes ,  do not have a resolution high enough to examine the fine structure of macroimages @xmath95 .
therefore , the source brightness , integrated over angles will be observed : @xmath96 amplification of the source brightness , resulted from gravitational focusing of a stationary source , is characterized by the amplification factor @xmath97 , which is defined as : @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the source brightness , which would be observed without the gl .
if @xmath100 is ment to be a total brightness of the whole distorted image of the source , then @xmath97 determines the total amplification factor of the lens .
if @xmath100 is the brightness of the @xmath101the macroimage , then @xmath97 means the amplification factor of the @xmath101th macroimage , @xmath102 . in this case , coefficients @xmath97 and @xmath102 are associated by a simple relationship : @xmath103 in the more general case , when the brightness of the source varies not only in angles , but also in time , 
@xmath104 ,  while the gl parameters are virtually unchanged , equations ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) can be generalized to take the form ( minakov & nechaev 1998 ) : @xmath105 \delta\left[\vec\psi_s-\vec f(\vec\psi)\right]d\vec\psi,\ ] ] @xmath106 @xmath107 is a signal propagation time along a virtual ray , that connects an arbitrary point of the source @xmath108 with an arbitrary point at the lens plane @xmath109 , and , further , with the observer @xmath7 .
taking into account that the local velocity of the signal propagation in the weak gravitational field with a potential @xmath110 , 
@xmath111  is equal to @xmath112 , and introducing the effective refraction index of the `` medium '' @xmath113 , ( bliokh & minakov 1989 ) , the propagation time @xmath107 can be determined by integrating @xmath113 along a curvilinear ray @xmath114 , that associates arbitrary points of the source , the lens and the observer : @xmath115 the effective refraction index can be representd as @xmath116    using a `` thin '' lens and paraxial optics approximation , intergration along the curvilinear ray in ( 15 ) can be replaced by integration along the lines , connecting a point element at the source surface with a point element at the lens plane , and the lens point with the observer . after simple transformations , we have the following expression : @xmath117 + t_{gr}(\vec\psi).\ ] ] the first addend in this formula is the propagation time for the signal in the empty space along the broken path `` source - lens - observer '' , see fig .
1 . the second term , @xmath118 ,
is due to the presence of gravitational field .
for the weak gravitational field , @xmath119 can be calculated by integrating of a gravitational addition @xmath120 in ( 15 ) along the rectilinear rays .
it is easy to show , that @xmath119 can be reduced to a form : @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the given surface mass density distribution for the lens , @xmath123 = kg / rad^2 $ ] , and integration is carried out over the whole surface of the gl in projection to the sky , and @xmath124 is an insignificant addition , affecting only a zero point of the time .
( 16 ) and ( 17 ) hold for the low - redshift gl systems , when the cosmology factor can be neglected .
( 13 ) has a simple physical meaning .
the point spread function of the lens , @xmath125,$ ] associates every particular angle of observation with a certain `` point '' element of the source surface , having an actual angle @xmath126 and a surface brightness @xmath127 temporal changes of @xmath128 will be recorded by the observer at an angle @xmath129 with a time delay of @xmath130 .
the exact coincidence between the temporal variations of the source brightness and brightness of its images is seen to occur only for the point sources . in focusing extended sources
, their actual light curves will differ from the light curves of the lensed images .    to simplify the further analysis
, we studied a variable source with the gaussian brightness profile : @xmath131 \cdot f(t,\vec\psi_s).\ ] ] where @xmath132 and @xmath133 are angular dimension and angular coordinate of the source brightness maximum , respectively , and @xmath134 is a dimensionless function of the order of unity , accounting for the temporal variations of brightness .
it is supposed further , that the source varies in time as a whole according to : @xmath135 where @xmath136 is a characteristic duration of the brightness flash , @xmath137 at @xmath138 , and @xmath139 at @xmath140    this model refers to the source , which flashed at @xmath141 , and then is gradually fading , with a characteristic decay time @xmath142 the @xmath143 quantity in eq . ( 18 ) is the full energy , emitted by the source : @xmath144 for the given model ( 18 ) , and according to ( 13 ) , the observed brightness distribution is described by the expression :    @xmath145\cdot h\left(t - t_p(\vec\psi)\right)\cdot\ ] ] @xmath146,\ ] ] where @xmath147    normalized quantities @xmath148 @xmath149 @xmath150 @xmath151 , and normalized time intervals @xmath152 and @xmath153 are more convenient to analyze gravitational focusing . in the normalized coordinates , the source brightness distribution ( 21 )
is reduced to a form : @xmath154}.\ ] ] we can get the light curve of the observed image @xmath155 having integrated eq .
( 22 ) over all possible angles of observations : @xmath156 the full energy of the observed splash of brightness ( impulse hereafter ) can be determined as @xmath157
for the gl systems observed in optics , @xmath158 holds as a rule , excluding rather extended radio sources , where @xmath159 may be of the order of unity or even larger .
it is known from the theory of gl , that the focusing effect of the gravitational field is negligible for the sources with @xmath160 , therefore , this case will not be analyzed further . according to ( 21 ) , for @xmath158 , radiation gets into the point of observation only from the small regions of space , situated near the point @xmath161 , where the index of power in the exponent becomes zero , i.e. when @xmath162 .
the roots @xmath161 of this equation , - lens equation ( 3 ) , - determine the coordinates of brightness peaks in the images , formed by the gl .
supposing , that @xmath10 separate images of the source are formed by the lens , - @xmath163 , - let us introduce small deviations @xmath164 from maxima @xmath165 , - @xmath166 , - and make the following simplifications , ( minakov et al .
2001 ) : @xmath167 @xmath168 where @xmath169 . with simplifications ( 25 ) taken into account
, the distribution of brightness ( 13 ) near the @xmath170-th image maximum may be presented as @xmath171 @xmath172}\times\ ] ] @xmath173},\ ] ] where @xmath174 all the derivatives in ( 27 ) are calculated in the point @xmath161 .
having in mind the introduced simplifications , after simple calculations , one can get the following asymptotic approximation for the light curve of the @xmath170-th ] @xmath175.\ ] ] the following designations are introduced here : @xmath176 @xmath177 and @xmath178 is the probability integral .
the introduced quantity @xmath102 can be easily shown to represent the amplification factor for the @xmath170-th image of a stationary source .    as it follows from simple physical considerations , amplification of the initial impulse @xmath143 in gravitational focusing originates only from the spatial redistribution of brightness , determined by the lens amplification factor @xmath97 .
thus , a condition @xmath179 must hold . indeed , having integrated ( 28 ) over the whole region of variation of @xmath180 , @xmath181 , we get the full energy of the focused impulse , arrived to the point of observations from the @xmath170-th ] for the values @xmath182 , we get the following approximate expression for @xmath183 , having used the asymptotic expression of @xmath178 : @xmath184 the light curve of the observed @xmath170-th image is seen to be formed from the initial undisturbed light curve @xmath185 by multiplying the latter by the amplification factor @xmath102 .
it should be noted however , that such a simple effect of a gl is observed only for @xmath186 at small values of @xmath187 the lens will distort the initial light curve of the source .
in addition , the amount of distortions will be different for different images because of the existing discrepancy in the values of @xmath188 relationships @xmath189 for different @xmath190 are presented in fig .
we investigated focusing of a quasar radiation by a regular component of the q2237 + 0305 system as an example .
for this system , @xmath191 and is described by eq .
( 4 ) , while the signal time delay @xmath192 , disregarding an insignificant additive term , is described by expression : @xmath193-\ ] ] @xmath194,\ ] ] where @xmath195 @xmath196 is a gravitational radius of the galaxy nucleus , and @xmath197 is the relative distance , ( kayser , refsdal & stabell 1986 ) .
it is easy to show , that there are four points in eq.(34 ) , where @xmath192 is minimal . for @xmath198 and @xmath199
coordinates of these points are , respectively : @xmath200 @xmath201    cccccccc image & @xmath202&@xmath203&@xmath204&@xmath205&@xmath102 & @xmath206&@xmath207 + a & 0.325 & -1.031 & 0 & -1.08 & 2.261 & 0.251 & 0.446 + b & 0.279 & 1.041 & 0 & 1.08 & 2.244 & 0.258 & 0.443 + c & -0.88 & -0.044 & -0.94 & 0 & 0.969 & 5.21 & 0.774 + d & 0.994 & -0.099 & 0.94 & 0 & 3.395 & 0.015 & 0.526 + nucleus & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & & & +    presense of minima in @xmath192 indicates , that temporal changes in the source will be observed in the lensed images in the directions of points ( 35 ) at first , and then in the a , b , c and d images .    for the obtained @xmath192 , ( 34 ) , a dimensionless parameter @xmath208 in ( 29 ) can be represented as @xmath209 where @xmath210 does not depend on @xmath211 and determines only by the value of @xmath212 relative distance @xmath213 , and by the coordinates of the four images .
for the given coordinates of the images , the corresponding values of parameters @xmath214 @xmath206 and @xmath215/\tau_g,$ ] ( @xmath216 ) were calculated .
the results are presented in table 1 .
the coordinates of the observed lensed images from ( crane et al .
1991 ) are also presented here , as well as the coordinates of the same images for the central source @xmath217    further calculations were made for the angular dimension of the source of @xmath218 and for two values of @xmath219 in fig .
7 , the individual light curves @xmath183 ( left ) , and a total one @xmath220 for @xmath221 , ( right ) are presented .
it is evident , that there is no possibility to detect separate images in the total light curve at small values of @xmath222 the components become distinguishable in the total light curve for sufficiently large values of @xmath222 for example , a total light curve for @xmath223 is shown in fig .
the discussed light curves referred only to a variable component of the source radiation . in reality , the radiation can be represented as a sum of a stationary and variable constituent . in this case , with ( 31 ) taken into account , the initial light curve would be given by the following expression : @xmath224 where @xmath225 is a stationary component of the source radiation .
the following total brightness as a function of time will be recorded in the point of observation : @xmath226,\ ] ] where @xmath227 is a total amplification factor of all the four images of q2237 + 0305 .
some conclusions can be made from the analysis of gravitational focusing of the extended source , that varies in time .    if a gravitational lens forms several images of the source , the light curve of an individual image @xmath228 will depend on the value of parameter @xmath190 , which accounts simultaneously for geometry of the task ( distances from the observer to the source and to the lens , @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively ) , parameters of the lens ( a total mass and its distribution ) , and the source parameters ( @xmath229 ) . for the model of gl q2237 + 0305 under consideration ,  a lens with a quadrupole ,  the value of @xmath190 was estimated to be @xmath230    if @xmath231 ( @xmath232  a `` small '' source , `` weak '' lens or `` long '' impulse ) , the light curve @xmath228 does not depend on @xmath190 any more , and differs from the undisturbed light curve @xmath233 by a multiplier @xmath97 only .    for small values of @xmath190 , when @xmath234 , ( @xmath235  `` extended '' source , `` strong '' lens , or `` short '' impulse ) , a smoothing action of the lens should be taken into account .
amounts of deformations will be different for different images , because of the existing difference in @xmath236    the analysis of focusing action of a gl with an arbitrary mass distribution allows to argue , that the gl acts as a filter , transmitting low frequencies ( slow brightness variations ) with no distortion , and `` rejecting '' the higher ones ,  rapid variations .

 a particular attention was given to the case , when microlenses ,  stars , star - like or planetary bodies ,  are situated near the critical curves of macrolenses , - galaxies , stellar clusters , etc . 
 the investigation is of interest for the gravitational lens ( gl ) systems , where the lensed images are observed close to the critical curve of a macrolens . 
 annular , arched or confluent images should be regarded as an indication to such a proximity . 
 numerical simulation allowed to determine structures of critical curves and caustics , formed by macro and microlenses , and to evaluate possible distortions , caused by microlenses for various locations with respect to the critical curve of a regular lens . 
 the difference of our results from those obtained earlier with the standard ( linearized ) approach to describe the regular gravitational lens was shown to be the larger the closer to the critical curve the microlenses are situated . 
 in addition to spatial redistributions in the visible images , complicated deformation of their light curves occurs in gravitational lensing of variable in time and extended sources . 
 the magnitudes of the temporal variations depend not only on the gl parameters ( e.g. , mass distribution ) , but on the parameters of the source as well , such as linear dimension of the emitting region , its location with respect to the critical curve , and the impulse duration . 
 the analysis shows , that in this case gl acts as a filter , which passes slow temporal variations without degradations , and smoothes the rapid ones .

"clusters of galaxies , the largest virialized systems known , provide one of the most powerful tools in studying the structure and evolution of the universe .
clusters highlight the large scale structure of the universe @xcite ; they trace the evolution of structure with time @xcite ; they constrain the amount and distribution of dark and baryonic matter @xcite ; they reveal important clues about the formation and evolution of galaxies @xcite ; and they place critical constraints on cosmology @xcite . in fact , clusters of galaxies place some of the most powerful constraints on cosmological parameters such as the mass density of the universe and the amplitude of mass fluctuations . in spite of their great value and their tremendous impact on understanding the universe , systematic studies of clusters of galaxies are currently limited by the lack of large area , accurate , complete , and objectively selected catalogs of optical clusters , and by the limited photometric and redshift information for those that do exist .    the first comprehensive catalog of clusters of galaxies ever produced , the abell catalog of rich clusters @xcite , was a pioneering project that provided a seminal contribution to the study of extragalactic astronomy and to the field of clusters of galaxies . while galaxy clustering had been recognized before abell , the data were fragmentary and not well understood .
both abell s catalog , as well as zwicky s @xcite independent catalog , were obtained by visual inspection of the palomar observatory sky survey plates .
these catalogs have served the astronomical community for nearly half a century and were the basis for many of the important advances in cluster science ( see references above ; also abell s centennial paper , @xcite ) . at the beginning of the new century , the need for a new comprehensive catalog of optical clusters  one that is automated , precise , and objectively selected , with redshifts that extend beyond the z@xmath140.2 limit of the abell catalog  has become apparent .
there have been recent advances in this direction , including large area catalogs selected by objective algorithms from digitized photographic plates ( @xcite for the lick catalog ; @xcite for the edcc catalog ; @xcite and @xcite for the apm catalog ) , as well as small area , deep digital surveys of distant clusters ( e.g. , the 5 deg@xmath2 palomar distant cluster survey , @xcite ; 100 deg@xmath2 red - sequence cluster survey , @xcite ; and 16 deg@xmath2 kpno deeprange survey , @xcite ) .
a particularly important advance for optical surveys has been the inclusion of accurate ccd - based color information for galaxy selection .
the inclusion of color in cluster selection greatly reduces the problems of density projection which have long plagued optical selection of clusters .
good examples of color - based optical selection include the 100 deg@xmath2 red - sequence cluster survey @xcite and the sdss selection described in this work .
surveys of x - ray clusters and observations of the sunyaev - zeldovich effect in clusters have and will continue to provide important data that is complementary to the optical observations of clusters of galaxies .
these methods identify rich systems that have developed an extensive hot intracluster medium . while excellent for selection of massive , well developed clusters , these methods have thresholds which are sensitive to the evolution of the hot intracluster medium , both with cosmic time and with the richness of the objects . in this sense
, optical selection has the important complementary advantage of being able to identify galaxy clustering across a wide range of system richness and time evolution .
the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) will provide a comprehensive digital imaging survey of 10@xmath15 deg@xmath2 of the north galactic cap ( and a smaller , deeper area in the south ) in five bands ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) , followed by a spectroscopic multi - fiber survey of the brightest one million galaxies (  [ clusterselection ] ) . with high photometric precession in 5 colors and a large area coverage ( comparable to the abell catalog ) , the sdss survey will enable state - of - the - art cluster selection using automated cluster selection methods .
nearby clusters ( to z @xmath14 0.05 - 0.1 ) can be selected directly in 3-dimensions using redshifts from the spectroscopic survey .
the imaging survey will enable cluster selection to z@xmath10.5 and beyond using the 5 color bands of the survey .
in the range z@xmath10.05 - 0.3 , the 2d cluster selection algorithms work well , with only small effects due to selection function ( for the richest clusters ) . in the nearest part of this range , z@xmath10.05 - 0.15 , the sdss spectroscopic data can also be useful for cluster confirmation and for redshift determination .
even poor clusters can be detected with high efficiency in this redshift range . for z@xmath10.3 - 0.5 ,
2d selection works well , but selection function effects become important , especially for poorer clusters .
several cluster selection algorithms have recently been applied to @xmath1400 deg@xmath2 of early sdss imaging commissioning data in a test of various 2d cluster selection techniques .
these methods , outlined in  [ clusterselection ] , include the matched - filter method @xcite , and the red - sequence color - magnitude method , maxbcg @xcite , as well as a cut and enhance method @xcite and a multicolor technique ( c4 ; @xcite ) .
each method can identify clusters of galaxies in sdss data to z@xmath10.5 , with richness thresholds that range from small groups to rich clusters , and with different selection functions .
since each algorithm uses different selection criteria that emphasize different aspects of clusters , the lists of clusters found by different techniques will not be identical .    in this paper we present a catalog of 799 clusters of galaxies in the redshift range z = 0.05 - 0.3 from 379 deg@xmath2 of sdss imaging data .
the catalog was constructed by merging lists of clusters found by two independent 2d cluster selection methods : hybrid matched filter and maxbcg . we compare the results from the two techniques and investigate the nature of clusters they select .
we derive scaling relations between cluster richness and observed cluster luminosity and cluster velocity dispersion .
we use the scaling relations to combine appropriate subsamples of these lists to produce a conservative merged catalog ; the catalog is limited to a richness threshold specified in  [ catalog ] ; the threshold corresponds to clusters with a typical velocity dispersion of @xmath21 400 km s@xmath8 .
the average space density of the clusters is @xmath22 mpc@xmath13 .
a flat lcdm cosmology with @xmath23= 0.3 and a hubble constant of h@xmath24 = 100 @xmath25 km s@xmath8 mpc@xmath8 with @xmath25 = 1 is used throughout .
the current work represents preliminary tests of selection algorithms on early sdss commissioning data .
the results will improve as more extensive sdss data become available .
the sdss imaging survey is carried out in drift - scan mode in five filters , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , to a limiting magnitude of @xmath2623 @xcite .
the spectroscopic survey will target nearly one million galaxies to approximately @xmath2617.7 , with a median redshift of z@xmath10.1 @xcite , and a small , deeper sample of @xmath110@xmath27 luminous red galaxies to @xmath2819 and z@xmath10.5 @xcite . for more details of the sdss survey see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .
cluster selection was performed on 379 deg@xmath2 of sdss commissioning data , covering the area @xmath29(2000 ) = 355  to 56 , @xmath30(2000 ) = -1.25  to 1.25 ; and @xmath29(2000 ) = 145.3  to 236.0 , @xmath30(2000)= -1.25  to 1.25  ( runs 94/125 and 752/756 ) .
the limiting magnitude of galaxies used in the cluster selection algorithms was conservatively selected to be @xmath2621 ( where @xmath18 is the sdss petrosian magnitude ) . at this magnitude limit , star - galaxy separation is excellent @xcite .
the clusters of galaxies studied in this paper were selected from these imaging data using a matched filter method @xcite and an independent color - magnitude maximum - likelihood brightest cluster galaxy method ( maxbcg ; @xcite ) .
these methods are briefly described below .
the matched filter method hmf ( hybrid matched filter ; @xcite ) is a hybrid of the matched filter @xcite and the adaptive matched filter techniques @xcite .
this method identifies clusters in imaging data by finding peaks in a cluster likelihood map generated by convolving the galaxy survey with a filter based on a model of the cluster and field galaxy distributions .
the cluster filter is composed of a projected density profile model for the galaxy distribution ( a plummer law profile is used here ) , and a luminosity function filter ( schechter function ) .
the filters use the typical parameters observed for galaxy clusters ( e.g. , core radius r@xmath31 = 0.1 @xmath9 mpc , cutoff radius r@xmath32=1 @xmath33mpc , and luminosity function parameters m@xmath34 and @xmath35 for @xmath25 = 1 ) .
the hmf method identifies the highest likelihood clusters in the imaging data ( @xmath18-band ) and determines their estimated redshift ( z@xmath0 ) and richness ( @xmath3 ) ; the richness @xmath3  is derived from the best - fit cluster model that satisfies l@xmath36(@xmath37 mpc ) = @xmath3l@xmath38 , where l@xmath36 is the total cluster luminosity within 1 @xmath9 mpc radius ( at z@xmath0 ) , and l@xmath39 .
a relatively high threshold has been applied to the cluster selection ( @xmath405.2 , @xcite ) ; the selected clusters have richnesses @xmath3@xmath7 20 - 30 ( i.e. , l@xmath36(@xmath41 mpc ) @xmath42 ) .
this threshold is below the typical abell richness class 0 .
the maxbcg method ( @xcite ) is based on the fact that the brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ) generally lies in a narrowly defined space in luminosity and color ( see , e.g , @xcite ) . for each sdss galaxy ,
a `` bcg likelihood '' is calculated based on the galaxy color ( @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) and magnitude ( m@xmath45 , in @xmath19-band ) .
the bcg likelihood is then weighted by the number of nearby galaxies located within the color - magnitude region of the appropriate e / s0 ridgeline ; this count includes all galaxies within 1 @xmath9 mpc projected separation that are fainter than m@xmath45 and brighter than the magnitude limit m@xmath45(lim ) = -20.25 , and are located within 2-@xmath46 of the mean observed color scatter around the e / s0 ridgeline ( i.e. , @xmath47 ) .
the combined likelihood is used for cluster identification .
the likelihood is calculated for every redshift from z = 0 to 0.5 , at 0.01 intervals ; the redshift that maximizes the cluster likelihood is adopted as the cluster redshift .
since bcg and elliptical galaxies in the red ridgeline possess very specific colors and luminosities , their observed magnitude and colors provide excellent photometric redshift estimates for the parent clusters .
the richness estimator , @xmath5 , is defined as the number of red e / s0 ridgeline galaxies ( within the 2-@xmath46 color scatter as discussed above ) that are brighter than m@xmath45(lim ) = -20.25 ( i.e. , 1 mag fainter than l@xmath48 in the @xmath19-band ; @xmath25 = 1 ) , and are located within a 1 @xmath9 mpc projected radius of the bcg .    the hmf and maxbcg methods focus on different properties of galaxy clusters : hmf finds clusters with approximately plummer density profiles and a schechter luminosity function , while maxbcg selects groups and clusters dominated by red @xmath49 galaxies .
we compare the results of these cluster selection algorithms in the following sections and merge the clusters into a single complementary self - consistent catalog .
when comparing different catalogs , uncertainties in cluster estimated redshift , position , richness , and selection function , in addition to the different nature of each cluster selection algorithm , render the comparisons difficult . even selecting the richest clusters from each catalog will not provide a perfect match , mostly due to the noisy estimate of richness and its sharp threshold . in this section
we briefly summarize the main comparisons of the cluster redshift , position , and richness estimators for the hmf and maxbcg methods .
the accuracy of cluster redshift estimates for each method was determined using comparisons with measured redshifts from the sdss spectroscopic data .
a comparison of the estimated and spectroscopic redshifts for hmf and maxbcg clusters with z@xmath0 = 0.05 - 0.3 and richnesses @xmath3@xmath4 40 ( hmf ) and @xmath5@xmath4 13 ( maxbcg ) is shown in figures 1 and 2 .
a spectroscopic match is considered if the spectroscopic galaxy is located at the position of the bcg . for these relatively high richness clusters
we find a redshift uncertainty of @xmath50 = 0.014 for maxbcg ( from 382 cluster matches ) and @xmath50 = 0.033 for hmf ( from 237 cluster matches ; there are fewer hmf matches since a spectroscopic match is defined at the bcg position so as to minimize noise ) . a direct comparison between the hmf and maxbcg estimated cluster redshifts , using a positional matching criterion defined below , is shown in figure 3 .    the positional accuracy of cluster centers is determined by comparing hmf - maxbcg cluster pairs ( in the above z = 0.05 - 0.3 sample ) with pairs in random catalogs .
the comparison shows significant excess of cluster matches over random for projected cluster separations of @xmath14 0.5 @xmath9 mpc , with a tail to @xmath1 1 @xmath9 mpc ( figure 4 ) .
these excess pairs represent real cluster matches ; their distribution provides a measure of the typical offset between the cluster centers determined in the two methods .
the offsets follow a gaussian distribution with a dispersion of 0.175 @xmath9 mpc ( figure 4 ) .
comparison of clusters identified by different selection methods depends not only on the positional and redshift uncertainties discussed above , and on the different selection function inherent to each catalog , but also on the uncertainties in the richness estimates .
the difference in selection functions and the uncertainties in richness estimates are the main cause of the relatively low matching rates among different samples ( see  [ catalog ] ) .
the richness scatter is important because each cluster sample is cut at a specific richness threshold ; since the observed richness function is steep and the richness scatter is significant , a richness threshold causes many clusters to scatter across the threshold .
this scatter has a strong effect on cluster sample comparisons .
we illustrate the effect by monte carlo simulations of two identical cluster samples with different noisy richness estimators ( figure 5 ) . placing a richness threshold on each sample
, we obtain richness limited subsamples . for an intrinsic richness function of @xmath51(richness)@xmath52 ( see  [ abundance ] ) , and a 30 @xmath53 scatter in richness , the overlap of the two samples is only 54 @xmath53 .
any difference in selection functions , which can be nearly a factor of @xmath12 in the two methods used here , will further reduce the apparent overlap .
this simple model provides an estimate for how large we might expect the overlap between two otherwise identical cluster samples to be .
it is important to bear this in mind as we make direct comparisons of cluster catalogs in subsequent sections .    how do the hmf and maxbcg cluster richness estimates compare with each other ?
cluster richness estimates describe , in one form or another , how populated or luminous a cluster is : either by counting galaxy members within a given radius and luminosity range , or by estimating total cluster luminosity . in general , this measure also reflects the mass of the cluster , its velocity dispersion , and temperature .
while richness correlates well on average with other parameters ( e.g. , rich clusters are more luminous and more massive than poor clusters ) , individual cluster richness estimates exhibit large scatter .
this scatter is due to the sharp luminosity threshold in the richness galaxy count , uncertainties in the background corrections , uncertainties in the estimated redshift and center of the cluster , sub - structure in clusters , and other effects .
still , optical richness estimators provide a basic measure of a cluster population ; richnesses have been determined for all clusters in the above catalogs .
the two richness estimates obtained by the cluster selection algorithms described above are @xmath5  for maxbcg and @xmath3  for hmf (  [ clusterselection ] ) .
@xmath5  is the number of red ( e / s0 ) ridgeline galaxies located within 1 @xmath33mpc of the bcg galaxy and are brighter then m@xmath45(lim ) = -20.25 .
the richness @xmath3  is determined by the hmf fine likelihood for each cluster and reflects the best - fit cluster model luminosity within 1 @xmath33mpc radius , l@xmath36(@xmath41 mpc)= @xmath3  l@xmath48 (  [ clusterselection ] ; see @xcite and @xcite ) . in comparing these richnesses , differences in
the estimated redshifts and cluster centers introduce additional scatter on top of any intrinsic variations .
figure 6 presents the observed relation between @xmath3  and @xmath5  for clusters with z@xmath0 = 0.05 - 0.3 and @xmath5@xmath4 13 . while the scatter is large , as expected from the monte carlo simulations ( figure 5 ) , a clear correlation between the mean richnesses is observed . the best - fit relation between @xmath5  ( as determined for the maxbcg clusters with @xmath5@xmath413 ) and
the mean @xmath3  ( for the matching hmf clusters ) is : @xmath54 the error - bars reflect uncertainties on the mean best - fit .
( this relation differs somewhat if both richnesses are determined at the maxbcg - selected cluster positions and redshifts or at the hmf - selected clusters ; see , e.g. , @xcite ) .
the ratio @xmath3/@xmath5  decreases somewhat with @xmath5 ; we find @xmath3/@xmath5   @xmath55 2 for @xmath5@xmath720 , increasing to @xmath3/@xmath5  @xmath1 3 for lower richnesses .
a comparison of the richness estimates @xmath3  and @xmath5  with directly observed cluster luminosities and velocity dispersions is discussed in the following section .
we derive preliminary scaling relations between cluster richness estimates and directly observed mean cluster luminosity and cluster velocity dispersion .
this enables a direct physical comparison between the independent catalogs and allows proper merging of the two samples .
it also provides a physical calibration of the cluster richness estimates in terms of their mean luminosity , velocity dispersion , and hence mass .
the observed cluster luminosities can be directly obtained from the sdss imaging data using population subtraction . by comparing the galaxy population in regions around cluster centers to that in random locations we can determine the properties of galaxies in and around the clusters as well as the cluster luminosities .
since the redshifts of the sdss clusters are relatively accurate , we can determine cluster luminosities in physical units  i.e. , in solar luminosities within a metric aperture .
the multi - color sdss data also allow us to apply accurate k - corrections to cluster galaxy magnitudes .
we determine the luminosity of a cluster by measuring the total luminosity of all galaxies within 0.6 @xmath33mpc of the cluster center .
we use all hmf and maxbcg clusters in the redshift range 0.05 @xmath56 z @xmath56 0.3 with richness @xmath3@xmath4 30 ( hmf ) and @xmath5@xmath4 10 ( maxbcg ) . for each cluster , we extract all galaxies within a projected radius of 0.6 @xmath33mpc of the cluster center , and compute a k - corrected absolute magnitude for each galaxy according to its type ( following @xcite ) .
we then sum the total luminosity ( @xmath18-band ) within the absolute magnitude range of -23.0@xmath57 - 19.8 .
we determine the background contribution to this total luminosity by selecting five random locations away from the cluster area ( within the same sdss stripe ) , each with the same angular extent ; we extract galaxies within these regions , k - correct them as if they were at the cluster redshift , and subtract the resulting mean luminosity ( within the same magnitude range ) from that of the cluster .
this process allows a determination of the variance in the background correction and yields an estimate of cluster luminosity within a radius of 0.6 @xmath33mpc and within the luminosity range -23.0@xmath57 - 19.8 ( corresponding to approximately 1.3 mag below hmf s @xmath58 ) .
we denote this luminosity @xmath59 .
a hubble constant of @xmath25 = 1 and a flat lcdm cosmology with @xmath23= 0.3 are used to determine cluster distances and luminosities .
details of this analysis , along with tests and a variety of related population subtraction results , will be presented in a forthcoming paper @xcite .    for greater accuracy , and to minimize the spread due to redshift uncertainty , all clusters with a given richness are stacked and their mean luminosity @xmath59 determined .
these stacked luminosities are presented as a function of cluster richness in figures 7 and 8 for the hmf and maxbcg clusters . a strong correlation between richness and mean
luminosity is observed ; this is of course expected , since both @xmath5  and @xmath3  represent cluster richnesses which broadly relate to luminosity (  [ clustercomparison ] ) .
the best - fit power - law relations to the binned mean luminosities are : @xmath60 the few highest richness points ( @xmath3@xmath61 80 , @xmath5@xmath61 33 ) exhibit large scatter due to their small numbers .
inclusion of these points does not change the fits ; we find @xmath59 = 1.6 @xmath5   ( for maxbcg , @xmath5@xmath410 ) and @xmath59 = 0.015 @xmath3@xmath62 ( for hmf , @xmath3@xmath4 30 ) .
the non - linearity observed in the @xmath63-@xmath3  relation at high @xmath3  reflects the fact that the measured cluster luminosity @xmath63 corrects for an underestimate in @xmath3  at high richness seen in simulations @xcite ; the luminosity @xmath63 measures the true cluster luminosity , independent of any uncertainty in cluster richness estimates .
the luminosity @xmath59 is the cluster luminosity down to a magnitude of -19.8 . to convert this luminosity to a total cluster luminosity
, we integrate the cluster luminosity function from -19.8@xmath64 down to the faintest luminosities .
the luminosity function of hmf clusters ( within r = 0.6 @xmath9 mpc ) is observed to have schechter function parameters of @xmath65 and m@xmath66 , and maxbcg has @xmath67 and m@xmath68 ( @xmath25 = 1 ; @xcite ) . integrating these luminosity functions from -19.8 down to zero luminosity yields correction factors of 1.42 ( for hmf ) and 1.34 ( for maxbcg ) for the added contribution of faint galaxies to the total cluster luminosity .
the total mean cluster luminosities are therefore given by equations 2 and 3 multiplied by these correction factors , yielding @xmath69      the sdss spectroscopic survey includes spectra of galaxies brighter than @xmath18 = 17.7 @xcite , with a median redshift of z = 0.1 , as well as spectra of the ` luminous red galaxy ' ( lrg ) sample that reaches to r @xmath55 19 and z @xmath1 0.5 @xcite .
for some rich clusters at low redshift , it is possible within the sdss spectroscopic data to directly measure the cluster velocity dispersion .
here we compare these velocity dispersions , together with velocity dispersions available from the literature ( for some of the abell clusters within the current sample ;  [ abell ] ) , to cluster richnesses ; this provides an independent physical calibration of richness .
the correlation between the observed cluster velocity dispersion and cluster richness is presented in figure 9 .
we use cluster velocity dispersions of 20 clusters determined from the sdss spectroscopic survey ( for clusters with @xmath130 to 160 redshifts ) using a gaussian fit method , as well as from several abell clusters available in the literature ( abell 168 , 295 , 957 , 1238 , 1367 , 2644 ; @xcite ) . even though the number of clusters with measured velocity dispersion is not large and the scatter is considerable , a clear correlation between median velocity dispersion and richness
is observed , as expected ( figure 9 ) .
the best - fit relations are : @xmath70    also shown in figure 9 , for comparison , are all stacked sdss spectroscopic data for the galaxy velocity differences in the clusters ( relative to the bcg velocity ) , subtracted for the mean observed background , as a function of richness .
these are obtained using the best gaussian fit to the stacked velocity data , after background subtraction .
the results are consistent with the directly observed @xmath46-@xmath3  and @xmath46-@xmath5  relations discussed above .
the velocity scaling relations ( equations 6 and 7 ) provide an important calibration of cluster richness versus mean cluster velocity dispersion ( and thus mass ) . also shown in the figures , for comparison ,
are the @xmath6-richness relations derived from the observed mean @xmath71-@xmath3  and @xmath71-@xmath5  correlations ( section  [ lumscale ] , figures 7 - 8) . here
the luminosity @xmath72 is converted to mass , m@xmath73 , using the typical observed m / l ratio relevant for these clusters and the observed relation between @xmath74 and @xmath6  based on calibration using gravitational lensing observations ( see @xcite for details ) .
good agreement exists between these independent scaling relations .
larger samples , when available , will further improve this important calibration .
the independent scaling relations discussed above are consistent with each other .
the directly observed mean @xmath3-@xmath5  relation ( equation 1 ) is in agreement with the observed luminosity - richness relations , @xmath75-@xmath3  and @xmath75-@xmath5  ( equations 4 and 5 ) .
both relations  the luminosity - richness relations and the @xmath3-@xmath5  relation  yield , independently , @xmath3@xmath76 , and reproduce the observed total luminosity relations discussed above .
this consistency is illustrated by the solid and dashed lines in figure 6 which represent , respectively , the observed mean @xmath3-@xmath5  relation and the one obtained from the mean luminosty - richness relations ( @xmath77-@xmath3  and @xmath77-@xmath5 ) .
the third independent relation , velocity dispersion versus richness ( equations 6 and 7 ) , is also consistent with the above results ; this is illustrated by the dotted curve in figure 6 .
the non - linearity observed in the @xmath63(@xmath3 ) @xmath1 @xmath3@xmath2 relation ( equation 3 and discussion below it ; figure 7 ) , and the similar non - linearity observed in the @xmath3@xmath1 @xmath5@xmath78 relation ( i.e. , @xmath5@xmath1 @xmath3@xmath2 ; equation 1 ; figure 6 ) , are consistent with the velocity scaling relation , @xmath46 = 10.2 @xmath3  ( equation 6 ) , since the latter implies that cluster mass ( within a fixed radius ) is m @xmath79 ; this is consistent with the observed @xmath80 .
the maxbcg relations are also self - consistent , with a linear @xmath81 @xmath5 , @xmath82 @xmath5@xmath83 , and hence m @xmath84 . in both cases , @xmath85 is nearly constant  in fact , slightly increasing with @xmath63 as expected ( e.g. , @xcite ) .
the consistency of the scaling relations is illustrated in figure 6 .
a summary of the mean quantitative scaling relations betweem @xmath3 , @xmath5 , velocity dispersion , luminosity , and mass ( within 0.6 @xmath9 mpc ) is presented in table 1 .
we use the scaling relations derived above (  [ scaling ] ) to define a conservative merged catalog of clusters of galaxies from the early sdss commissioning data based on the maxbcg and the hybrid matched - filter samples .
the merged bh catalog is limited to clusters within the redshift range z@xmath0 = 0.05 - 0.3 and richness above the threshold listed below , over the 379 deg@xmath86 area (  [ clusterselection ] ) .
a total of 799 clusters are listed in the catalog .
the clusters are selected using the following criteria :    1 .
z@xmath0 = 0.05 - 0.3 2 .
richness threshold of @xmath3@xmath440 ( for hmf clusters ) and @xmath5@xmath413 ( for maxbcg clusters ) .
these thresholds are comparable to each other and correspond to a mean cluster velocity dispersion of @xmath87 400 km s@xmath8 and luminosity l@xmath88 l@xmath89 ; the related mass is approximately m@xmath90 m@xmath11(see table 1 ) .
clusters that overlap between the two methods are considered as single clusters if they are separated by @xmath561 @xmath33mpc ( projected ) and @xmath560.08 in estimated redshift ( 2.5-@xmath91 ) .
overlap clusters are listed as a single cluster , on a single line , but include the relevant parameters from both the hmf and maxbcg selection ( position , redshift , richness ) .
this is done in order to provide complete information about the clusters and allow their proper use with the independent hmf and maxbcg selection functions .
for each cataloged cluster ( hmf with @xmath3@xmath4 40 or maxbcg with @xmath5@xmath4 13 ) we include cluster matches ( i.e. , overlaps with separations as defined above ) that reach beyond the richness or redshift thresholds of the catalog .
for example , an hmf cluster with @xmath3@xmath4 40 and z = 0.30 may list as a match a maxbcg cluster with @xmath5@xmath92 13 and/or z = 0.22 to 0.38 ( i.e. , @xmath93z @xmath56 0.08 ) . a lower limit of @xmath5@xmath46 is set for all matches . while not part of the @xmath3@xmath440 , @xmath5@xmath413 catalog , such matches with @xmath5@xmath9213 and @xmath3@xmath9240 clusters are listed in order to provide full information of possible matches , considering the large uncertainty in the richness parameter .
( if there is more than one match per cluster , we select the one with the closest separation ) . some of the matches , especially at low richness ( @xmath5@xmath1410 ) and large separation ( @xmath1 1 @xmath9 mpc or @xmath93z @xmath1 0.08 ) , may be coincidental .
clusters that do not overlap are listed as separate clusters and are so noted .    the catalog is presented in table 2 .
listed in the catalog , in order of increasing right - ascension , are the following : sdss cluster number ( column 1 ) , method of detection ( h for hmf , b for maxbcg ; lower case ( h , b ) represents cluster matches that are outside the catalog richness or redshift thresholds , i.e. , @xmath3@xmath9240 , @xmath5@xmath9213 , z@xmath610.3 ; column 2 ) , hmf @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( in degrees 2000 ; column 3 - 4 ) , hmf estimated redshift ( column 5 ) , hmf cluster richness @xmath3  ( column 6 ) .
columns 7 - 10 provide similar information for the maxbcg detection , if the cluster so detected : @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( 2000 ; column 7 - 8) , maxbcg redshift estimate ( column 9 ) , and richness estimate @xmath5  ( column 10 ) .
an sdss spectroscopic redshift that matches the cluster , if available , is listed in column 11 ( mainly for the bcg galaxy ) .
column 12 lists matches with abell and x - ray clusters .
all the noras x - ray clusters and 53 of the 58 abell clusters in this area are identified in the catalog ; the additional five abell clusters are identified by the combined hmf and maxbcg techniques but are below the catalog richness threshold ( see  [ abell ] ) .
the catalog contains 436 hmf clusters ( @xmath3@xmath4 40 ) , 524 maxbcg clusters ( @xmath5@xmath4 13 ) , and a total merged catalog ( as defined above ) of 799 clusters ( at @xmath94 = 0.05 - 0.3 ) .
some clusters are false - positive detections ( i.e. , not real clusters ) ; the false - positive rate is discussed below .
the overlap between the independent hmf and maxbcg clusters within the above redshift range is 81@xmath53 ( of the hmf clusters , accounting for all matches to @xmath5@xmath46 ) .
this overlap rate is consistent with expectations based on the selection functions and false - positive rates for the hmf and maxbcg clusters ( see below ) and the effects of redshift and positional uncertainties .
the overlap rate increases to @xmath7 90@xmath53 with more liberal matching criteria ( e.g. , separation larger than 1 @xmath9 mpc and/or larger than 0.08 in redshift ) . the overlap rate drops , as expected , when the richness restriction of the matching sample is tightened ( e.g. , the matching rate is 37@xmath53 if only @xmath5@xmath413 matches are considered for @xmath3@xmath440 hmf clusters ; this is consistent with expectations based on monte carlo richness simulations ,  [ clustercomparison ] ) .
the richest clusters , hmf with @xmath3@xmath452 , are matched at a higher rate , as expected : 90@xmath53 match with @xmath5@xmath46 maxbcg clusters and 61@xmath53 match with @xmath5@xmath413 clusters .
a summary of the catalog cluster distribution by redshift and richness is presented in table 3 .
selection functions for the independent hmf and maxbcg clusters have been determined from simulations and are presented as a function of redshift and richness in figure 10 ( for hmf ; @xcite ) and figure 11 ( for maxbcg ; @xcite ) ( see above refereneces for more details ) .
the richest clusters are nearly complete and volume limited to z @xmath14 0.3 , while the @xmath3@xmath1 40 hmf clusters are only @xmath140@xmath53 complete at z @xmath1 0.3 .
the selection functions need to be properly accounted for in any statistical analysis of the current samples .
some systems are false - positive detections ( i.e. , non - real clusters ) .
the false - positive detection rates for the clusters have been estimated from simulations @xcite as well as from visual inspection .
the false - positive rate is found to be small ( @xmath1410@xmath53 ) for the @xmath5@xmath413 maxbcg and @xmath3@xmath440 hmf clusters ( z = 0.05 - 0.3 ) .
all detections are included in the catalog , including false - positive detections , in order to avoid unquantitative visual selection .
some maxbcg systems are found to be small clumps of red galaxies in the outskirts of richer hmf clusters .
some un - matched hmf and maxbcg systems are in fact parts of the same larger cluster split into separate listings because of the @xmath93z @xmath560.08 and the 1 @xmath9 mpc separation cutoff .
this can result from uncertainties in z@xmath0 and from the different definitions of cluster center ( i.e. , hmf clusters typically center on a mean high density region , while maxbcg clusters center on a likely bcg galaxy ) .
the splittings may also represent sub - structure in clusters .
occasionally , a single hmf or maxbcg cluster may be split by the selection algorithm into two separate systems , which may represent sub - clustering .
some systems may be part of an extended galaxy overdensity region rather than true condensed virialized clusters ; this is less likely for the richer systems .    the scaling relations between richness , luminosity and velocity dispersion (  [ scaling ] )
suggest that @xmath3@xmath7 40 and @xmath5@xmath7 13 clusters correspond to approximately @xmath6@xmath7 400 km s@xmath8 , and @xmath3@xmath7 60 and @xmath5@xmath7 30 clusters correspond to @xmath6@xmath7 600 km  s@xmath8 , i.e. , rich clusters .
the mean calibrations are summarized in table 1 .
the distribution of clusters on the sky is mapped for the catalog clusters in figure 12 .
all clusters with 0.05 @xmath56 z @xmath56 0.3 , richness @xmath3@xmath4 40 ( for hmf ) and @xmath5@xmath4 13 ( for maxbcg ) , and their matching clusters are shown .
the abell clusters located in the survey area are also shown ( see  [ abell ] ) .
a 1 @xmath33mpc radius circle is presented around the center of each cluster ; this helps visualize possible matches that may be offset in their center position due to uncertainties in cluster centers and the different definition of `` center '' (  [ clustercomparison ] ) , or may represent sub - structure within more extended regions .
images of a sample of cataloged clusters representing a wide range of redshift ( z@xmath550.05 - 0.3 ) and richness ( @xmath3@xmath740 , @xmath5@xmath713 ) are presented as examples in figure 13 .
a total of 58 abell clusters @xcite are located in the current survey region .
the sdss bh catalog includes 53 ( 91@xmath53 ) of these clusters ( listed in the last column of table 2 ) , using the matching requirement of a projected separation of less than 1 @xmath9 mpc .
( since many of abell clusters have no measured redshifts , no redshift information is used . )
most matches are at separations typically @xmath14 0.2 @xmath9 .
the five additional abell clusters not listed in the catalog are all detected by the combined hmf and maxbcg methods , but are below the catalog threshold ; these are a116 ( @xmath3= 29 , @xmath5= 9 ) , a237 ( @xmath3= 35 , @xmath5= 7 ) , a295 ( @xmath5= 11 ) , a2051 ( @xmath5= 11 ) , a2696 ( @xmath5= 11 ) .
this matching rate is consistent with the expected selection function of the hmf and maxbcg methods .
eight clusters from the noras x - ray cluster catalog @xcite lie in the sdss bh area and redshift region .
all eight x - ray clusters are detected and included in our catalog ; maxbcg detects all eight clusters ( with 2 below the threshold of @xmath5= 13 ) , and hmf detects seven of the clusters ( all within the catalog threshold of @xmath3@xmath4 40 ) .
details of the comparison are given in table 4 .
the observed distribution of cluster abundance as a function of richness  the cluster richness function  is presented in figure 14 .
the observed cluster counts are corrected for the relevant hmf and maxbcg selection functions .
here each cluster is corrected by the selection function appropriate for its richness and redshift ( for each method ; see figures 10 , 11 ) and by the false - positive expectation rate (  [ catalog ] ) .
the corrected count is divided by the sample volume to produce a volume - limited cluster abundance as a function of richness .
smaller corrections for richness and redshift uncertainties are not included ; these will reduce the cluster abundances by @xmath95 to @xmath96 for @xmath3@xmath140 to @xmath160 ( see @xcite ) .
the results show a steeply declining richness function with increasing richness , as expected . the richness function of the hmf - selected and maxbcg - selected clusters are consistent with each other when properly corrected for the different selection functions and scaled by the richness scaling relation .
the richness function indicates a cluster abundance of @xmath12 mpc@xmath13 for @xmath3@xmath7 40 and @xmath5@xmath7 13 clusters ( @xmath97 400 @xmath98 ) .
these abundances are in general good agreement with abell clusters and with other richness or temperature function observations when properly scaled by the relevant richness scaling relations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .
the mass function of sdss clusters was recently determined by @xcite ( for z = 0.1 - 0.2 , using an extension of the current catalog to slightly lower richnesses ) , yielding consistent results for the hmf and maxbcg subsamples .
the mass function was used by @xcite to place strong cosmological constraints on the mass density parameter of the universe , @xmath23 , and the amplitude of mass fluctuations , @xmath99 : @xmath23= 0.19 @xmath100 and @xmath99 = 0.9 @xmath101 .
we compare two independent cluster selection methods used on 379 deg@xmath2 of early sdss commissioning data : matched - filter ( hmf ) and the color - magnitude maxbcg .
we clarify the relation between the methods and the nature of clusters they select .
hmf selects clusters that follow a typical density profile and luminosity function , while maxbcg selects clusters dominated by bright red galaxies  quite different selection criteria .
we determine scaling relations between the observed cluster richness , luminosity , and velocity dispersion .
we use the above scaling relations to combine appropriate subsamples of the hmf and maxbcg clusters and produce a conservative merged catalog of 799 clusters of galaxies at z@xmath0 = 0.05 - 0.3 above richness threshold of @xmath3@xmath4 40 ( hmf ) and @xmath5@xmath4 13 ( maxbcg ) (  [ catalog ] ) .
this threshold corresponds to clusters with a typical mean velocity dispersion of @xmath6@xmath7 400 km s@xmath8 , total @xmath18-band luminosity l@xmath102 l@xmath11  and mass m@xmath103 m@xmath11  ( within a radius of 0.6 @xmath9 mpc ) .
this threshold reflects clusters that are poorer than abell richness class 0 .
the average space density of the clusters is @xmath12 clusters / mpc@xmath104 . using the relevant selection functions
, we determine the cluster richness function ; we find it to be a steeply declining function of cluster abundance with increasing richness .
we compare the cataloged clusters with the abell and x - ray clusters located in the survey region ; they are all detected ( with 5 of the 58 abell clusters below the above merged richness cuts ) .
the relevant selection functions for the catalog clusters are provided .
the catalog can be used for studies of individual clusters , for comparisons with other objects ( e.g. , x - ray clusters , sz clusters , agns ) , and in statistical analyses ( when properly corrected for the relevant selection functions ) .    as an example , we determined the mass function of clusters ( see @xcite ) and used it to place powerful constarints on the mass - density parameter of the universe and the amplitude of mass fluctuations ; we find @xmath23= 0.19 @xmath100 and @xmath99 = 0.9 @xmath101 .
the current work represents preliminary results from early sdss commissioning data ( 4@xmath53 of the ultimate sdss survey ) .
the results will greatly improve as more extensive sdss data become available .

 the catalog is based on merging two independent selection methods  a color - magnitude red - sequence maxbcg technique ( b ) , and a hybrid matched - filter method ( h ) . 
 the bh catalog includes clusters with richness @xmath3@xmath4 40 ( matched - filter ) and @xmath5@xmath4 13 ( maxbcg ) , corresponding to typical velocity dispersion of @xmath6@xmath7 400 km s@xmath8 and mass ( within 0.6 @xmath9 mpc radius ) @xmath10 m@xmath11 . 
 this threshold is below abell richness class 0 clusters . 
 the average space density of these clusters is @xmath12 mpc@xmath13 . 
 all noras x - ray clusters and 53 of the 58 abell clusters in the survey region are detected in the catalog ; the 5 additional abell clusters are detected below the bh catalog cuts . the cluster richness function is determined and found to exhibit a steeply decreasing cluster abundance with increasing richness . 
 we derive observational scaling relations between cluster richness and observed cluster luminosity and cluster velocity dispersion ; these scaling relations provide important physical calibrations for the clusters 
 . the catalog can be used for studies of individual clusters , for comparisons with other sources such as x - ray clusters and agns , and , with proper correction for the relevant selection functions , also for statistical analyses of clusters . "
"the time evolution of a liquid film spreading over a solid surface under the action of the surface tension and viscosity can be described by lubrication models @xcite .
these models approximate the full navier - stokes equations that appear in the study of motion and instabilities of the liquid film dynamics
. thin films play an increasingly important role in a wide range of applications , for example , packaging , barriers , membranes , sensors , semiconductor devices , and medical implants .
spin coating is one of the methods that is widely used to coat uniform thin films onto solid surfaces in a variety of industrial applications such as manufacturing of the magnetic and optical discs . in this technology ,
a liquid drop spreads radially due to centrifugal effects from spinning and eventually yields a thin film of uniform thickness formed on the solid surface . in experiments , a variety of different types of bifurcations and steady states
have been observed @xcite .    in this paper
we consider the dynamics of a viscous incompressible thin fluid film on the outer surface of a horizontal circular cylinder that is rotating around its axis in the presence of a gravitational field .
the coating flow is generated by viscous forces due to the cylinder s surface motion relative to the fluid .
there is no temperature gradient , hence the interface does not experience a shear stress .
if the cylinder is fully coated there is only one free boundary : where the liquid meets the surrounding air .
otherwise , there is also a free boundary ( or contact line ) where the air and liquid meet the cylinder s surface .
the motion of the liquid film is governed by four physical effects : viscosity , gravity , surface tension , and centrifugal forces .
these are reflected in the following parameters :    * @xmath3 is the radius of the cylinder ; * @xmath4 is the constant rate of its rotation ; * @xmath5 is the acceleration due to gravity ; * @xmath6 is the kinematic viscosity ; * @xmath7 is the fluid density ; * @xmath8 is the surface tension .
these parameters yield three independent dimensionless numbers : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the reynolds number and @xmath11 is the weber number .    taking the ratio @xmath12 as a small parameter , where @xmath13 is the average thickness of the liquid
, we consider the limit @xmath14 such that @xmath15 remain finite and nonzero .
one can model the flow on a rotating cylinder using the full navier - stokes equations for the velocity vector @xmath16 , where @xmath17 $ ] is the axial variable , @xmath18 $ ] is the angular variable , @xmath19 is the variable in the direction of the cylinder , and @xmath20 is the thickness of the fluid on the surface of the cylinder at time @xmath21 .
the simplifying model that takes into account the small surface tension and the gravitational force was considered in a number of works including pukhnachev @xcite and obrien @xcite .
this model is written in the form , @xmath22 + \tfrac{1}{3 } \chi \partial_{\theta } \left [ h^3 \left ( \partial_{\theta }   h + \partial_{\theta}^3   h \right ) \right ] = 0,\ ] ] where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are given in ( [ params ] ) and @xmath25 .
the model assumes no - slip boundary conditions at the liquid / solid interface .
a solution to equation ( [ a : pukheq ] ) is physically relevant if either @xmath26 is strictly positive ( the cylinder is fully coated ) or @xmath26 is nonnegative ( the cylinder is wet in some region and dry in others ) .    in a similar context of the syrup rings on a rotating roller ,
moffatt @xcite neglected the effects of the surface tension ( i.e. , @xmath27 ) and obtained the reduced equation , @xmath28 = 0.\ ] ]    the stationary solutions of ( [ a : pukheq ] ) are given by the @xmath29-periodic solutions of the third - order differential equation , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the constant that corresponds physically to flux of the liquid through the film cross section .
moffatt @xcite and obrien & gath @xcite considered stationary solutions of ( [ stat - eq ] ) with @xmath32 .
besides smooth periodic solutions for small values of @xmath31 , there are two continua of shock solutions for a critical value of @xmath33 , one is associated with the increasing shocks and the other one is associated with the decreasing shocks . both families of solutions
are parameterized by the integral @xmath34 which has the physical meaning of the mass of the liquid .
the solution branches can be plotted on the parameter plane @xmath35 for fixed values of @xmath23 and @xmath24 , which we term as the _ mass  flux diagram_.    physical arguments convinced the authors of @xcite that the decreasing shocks are unstable and can not be observed in the rotational cylinder if the surface tension effects are included with @xmath36 . the singular perturbation theory of small @xmath24 was recently considered by benilov _
@xcite , where the authors showed that the decreasing shocks do not exist for small positive @xmath24 . on the other hand ,
increasing shocks become regularized for small @xmath37 and asymptotic arguments complemented by the numerical approximations were developed in @xcite to predict spectral stability of stationary solutions with regularized increasing shocks .
pukhnachev @xcite proved the existence and uniqueness of the steady states in the differential equation ( [ stat - eq ] ) if @xmath24 and @xmath31 are not too large .
karabut @xcite constructed two branches of steady states in the opposite limits of large @xmath24 .
numerical approximations in benilov _
@xcite ( figure 14 ) showed that the mass - flux diagram may become more complicated for small @xmath24 and large @xmath38 and may include a loop near the value @xmath33 .
three solutions coexist for a fixed @xmath38 if the loop is present .
stability of these solutions was not studied in @xcite .
it is the purpose of this work to continue , improve , and clarify the preliminary results of benilov _ et al .
in particular , we develop the dynamical system methods to prove that the family of increasing shocks persists with respect to @xmath36 , whereas the family of decreasing shocks terminate at @xmath32 .
we develop a delicate numerical approximation of the steady solutions of equation ( [ stat - eq ] ) to show that the number of loops on the mass - flux diagram increases when @xmath24 is reduced to zero and the location of these loops go to infinity .
we also apply numerical approximations of eigenvalues of the linearized time evolution associated with the lubrication model ( [ a : pukheq ] ) and show that if @xmath0 is the number of loops on the mass - flux diagram , then @xmath2 solution branches are stable with respect to small perturbations .
the article is organized as follows .
section 2 presents results of the geometric theory on persistence of increasing regularized shocks .
section 3 presents numerical results on multi - valued loops in the mass  flux diagram .
section 4 provides a summary and discusses open questions .    *

we shall study here asymptotic solutions of the steady - state equation ( [ stat - eq ] ) . using the transformation @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 and dropping the tilde sign for @xmath26 and @xmath31
, we obtain the third - order differential equation @xmath42 = \cos(\theta ) - \frac{3(h - q)}{h^3 } , \quad \theta \in ( -\pi,\pi),\ ] ] where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are parameters of the problem .
solutions of the limiting problem @xmath45 depends on the value of the flux @xmath44 . if @xmath46 , the @xmath29-periodic solution @xmath47 is unique @xcite .
let us denote the smallest roots of @xmath48 for @xmath46 by @xmath49 such that @xmath50 .
the unique solution of the limiting problem ( [ algebraic - order ] ) satisfies @xmath51 with @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 .    for @xmath55 ,
no solution @xmath47 exists because @xmath56 .    for @xmath57
, there is a unique continuous solution @xmath47 with properties ( [ properties - h ] ) and @xmath52 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 .    besides this continuous solution at @xmath57 , there exists two symmetric families of shock solutions with a jump discontinuity at either @xmath61 or @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is a continuous parameter .
let us denote the two simple zeros of @xmath64 by @xmath65 such that @xmath66 .
the increasing shock is centered at @xmath62 and satisfies @xmath67 with @xmath52 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 .    using the symmetry the limiting problem ( [ algebraic - order ] ) with respect to reflection @xmath71
, the decreasing shock can be constructed using the reflection .
it is then centered at @xmath61 .
the net mass @xmath38 defined by ( [ mass ] ) is a one - to - one increasing function of @xmath31 for @xmath72 with @xmath73 and @xmath74 for some @xmath75 , whereas the two families of shock solutions for @xmath76 correspond to the values of @xmath77 .    to consider the persistence of the two shock solutions with respect to parameter @xmath78
, we shall zoom the coordinate @xmath79 near @xmath80 by the transformation @xmath81 the new function @xmath82 satisfies a new version of the third - order differential equation @xmath83 where @xmath82 is a periodic function with period @xmath84 and @xmath85    the limiting problem at @xmath86 becomes now the autonomous equation , @xmath87    recall that @xmath65 are zeros of @xmath88 with ordering @xmath66 .
the increasing shock @xmath47 corresponds to a heteroclinic orbit @xmath82 of the limiting problem ( [ third - order - limit ] ) satisfying the boundary conditions @xmath89 the decreasing shock corresponds to a heteroclinic orbit with the boundary conditions @xmath90    linearization of the limiting equation ( [ third - order - limit ] ) near the equilibrium states @xmath65 gives @xmath91 where @xmath92 and @xmath93 .
therefore , the equilibrium state @xmath94 has a _ two - dimensional _ unstable manifold @xmath95 and a _
one - dimensional _ stable manifold @xmath96 , whereas the equilibrium state @xmath97 has a _ one - dimensional _ unstable manifold @xmath98 and a _ two - dimensional _ stable manifold @xmath99
.    intersection of the two - dimensional manifolds in @xmath100 is transverse in the space @xmath101 .
hence , a homoclinic orbit satisfying the boundary conditions ( [ increasing ] ) exists generally and persists under the perturbation .
intersection of the one - dimensional manifolds in @xmath102 is non - transverse in the space @xmath101 .
hence , a homoclinic orbit satisfying the boundary conditions ( [ decreasing ] ) does not exist generally and does not persist under the perturbation .
moreover , it was shown in @xcite using sign - definite integral quantities that no solution of the limiting equation ( [ third - order - limit ] ) with the boundary conditions ( [ decreasing ] ) exists .    as a result
, the geometric theory implies that the increasing shock ( [ properties - h ] ) centered at @xmath62 persists as a smooth solution @xmath47 of the third - order equation ( [ third - order ] ) for any small @xmath43 , whereas the decreasing shock centered at @xmath61 does not persist in the third - order equation ( [ third - order ] ) for any small @xmath43 .
this conclusion holds for any fixed @xmath103 .
it does not exclude , however , a possibility of a complicated branching behavior in the solutions of the third - order equation ( [ third - order ] ) that can come from @xmath104 for small values of @xmath43 .
we shall consider the construction of solutions of the third - order equation ( [ third - order ] ) numerically .
we shall construct numerical approximations of solutions of the third - order differential equation ( [ third - order ] ) .
the numerical approximations were generated using a custom - written turning - point algorithm and implemented in matlab .
solutions were found using newton - raphson iterations using fourier spectral differentiation matrices with 256 , 512 , and 1024 fourier modes .
the mass  flux diagram was generated with parameter continuation of @xmath31 or @xmath38 , as decided by the algorithm .
a convergent solution was defined numerically if the @xmath105 iteration @xmath106 satisfied @xmath107}|h_{n+1}(\theta ) - h_n(\theta)| \leq 5 \times 10^{-8}.\ ] ] eventually non - convergent solutions were found and the parameter continuation failed at this ` turning point ' . to resolve the mass  flux diagram near the turning point ,
the following algorithm was implemented : first , a reference point was identified in @xmath108 steps behind the turning point ( for our simulations , we generally chose @xmath109 ) .
next , the convergence of the points making up a half - circle centered at the turning point was checked .
the orientation of the half - circle was chosen to be facing away from the direction of the current parametrization ( i.e. if we are increasing along the vertical axis then the lower half of the circle would be chosen ) .
a vector was then drawn from the turning point to the convergent point with the largest distance from the reference point .
finally , the direction of new parametrization was chosen from the largest component of this vector .
we found that this algorithm successfully navigated the loops in the mass - flux diagram .
figure [ figure-1 ] shows the mass - flux diagram of stationary solutions for four values of @xmath78 . for @xmath110 ( dashed curve )
, we see no loops in the mass - flux diagram . for each fixed value of mass @xmath38 , there is exactly one value of the flux @xmath31 for the stationary solution of ( [ third - order ] ) .
the first loop is formed for @xmath111 ( light gray ) . in an interval of values of @xmath38 ,
three stationary solutions coexist for three different values of @xmath31 .
note that this loop was discovered by benilov _
@xcite ( figure 14 ) .    reducing @xmath78
further , we observe a formation and persistence of the second loop in the mass - flux diagram for @xmath112 ( dark gray ) and @xmath113 ( solid black ) .
five solutions for different values of @xmath31 coexist in an interval of values of @xmath38 .
the number of loops keeps increasing as @xmath78 decreases to zero and their location is drifted to large values of @xmath38 .
as @xmath14 , the mass - flux diagram represent an increasing curve for @xmath114 and a constant level @xmath76 for @xmath103 , where @xmath115 and @xmath116 .
the limiting picture corresponds to the mass - flux diagram of the solutions of the limiting equation ( [ algebraic - order ] ) that include the smooth solutions for @xmath117 and the shock solutions for @xmath76 .
+    we focus now on two particular examples of the mass - flux diagram with a single loop and a double loop .
figure [ figure-2 ] ( top ) shows the mass - flux diagram for @xmath111 with a single loop .
we can identify three solution branches ( labeled as s1,s2 , and s3 ) connected at two bifurcation points ( labeled as bf1 and bf2 ) .
the other point of intersections of solution branches s1 and s2 is not a bifurcation point because the two solutions for the same value of @xmath38 and @xmath31 remain distinguishable into two different solutions . for @xmath118 , we compute the solution profiles and show them on figure [ figure-2 ] ( bottom ) . although similar in their shapes , the three steady state solutions are clearly distinct .
the peaks of the solutions are located for @xmath119 , or equivalently for @xmath120 , thanks to the @xmath29-periodicity of the solutions .
they correspond to the increasing shock solution as @xmath14 located at @xmath121 .
oscillations , which are visible on both sides of the shock are attributed to complex eigenvalues of the linearized equation ( [ linearized ] ) after the scaling transformation ( [ scaling - transf ] ) and the limit @xmath14 .
because of multiple steady - state solutions with the same physical parameter of the mass @xmath38 , we anticipate that they may have different stability properties .
therefore , we examine eigenvalues of the linearized equation @xmath122 = 0,\ ] ] where @xmath47 is a @xmath29-periodic steady - state solution and @xmath123 is a @xmath29-periodic perturbation to the steady state with the growth rate @xmath124 .
if @xmath125 , the perturbation @xmath126 grows on the background of @xmath47 and induces instability of the steady - state solution . expressing @xmath47 from the third - order equation ( [ third - order ] ) , we can rewrite the spectral problem ( [ lin - third - order ] ) in the equivalent form , @xmath127.\ ] ]    note that there is always a zero eigenvalue in the spectral problem ( [ lin - third - order - new ] ) .
indeed , @xmath128 is an eigenfunction for @xmath129 because @xmath31 is a free parameter of the solution @xmath26 .
we will now show that the zero eigenvalue is simple .
first , since the jacobian operator in the iteration algorithm was found to be invertible , the operator @xmath130 is invertible , where @xmath131 since @xmath132 and @xmath133 has a one - dimensional kernel , the operator @xmath134 has at most one eigenvector in the kernel , which is @xmath128 .
next , we consider the adjoint spectral problem , @xmath135 \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}.\ ] ] it is clear that @xmath136 is the adjoint eigenfunction for @xmath129 and that @xmath137 is nonzero at all values of @xmath31 but the bifurcation points bf1 and bf2 . by fredholm theory for isolated eigenvalue
, this fact implies that @xmath129 is a simple eigenvalue for all values of @xmath31 but the bifurcation points bf1 and bf2 .
we use a numerical method based on building a matrix representation of the differential operator @xmath134 acting on @xmath138 . to do so
, we discretize the space and approximate the derivatives using the fourier spectral method . the eigenvalue problem is then solved using the matlab function _
eig_.    the real part of the smallest eigenvalues @xmath139 of the spectral problem ( [ lin - third - order - new ] ) is shown on figure [ figure-4 ] for @xmath111 and @xmath118 .
all other eigenvalues have larger negative real parts . between the two bifurcation points bf1 and bf2 , one eigenvalue crosses zero and becomes unstable ,
revealing a saddle - node bifurcation at points bf1 and bf2 .
branch s3 ( between bf1 and bf2 ) is unstable with exactly one real positive eigenvalue @xmath139 .
other two branches s1 and s2 are stable with all but one zero eigenvalue having negative real parts .
it follows from figure [ figure-2 ] ( bottom ) that the profile of the steady - state solution at branch s3 is squeezed between those of the solutions at branches s1 and s2 .
small perturbations of the middle tail of the unstable solution is expected to grow towards the upper or lower tails of the other two stable solutions .
particular values of @xmath139 for branches s1 , s2 , and s3 are given in table 1 .

we have thus explored the behavior of a thin liquid film in a rotating cylinder accounting for surface tension and gravity . in particular
, we showed that regularized increasing shock solutions persist under small surface tension .
these shock solutions were then visualized for a wide range of parameter values by using numerical discretizations on an uniform grid .
we have identified a number of solution branches on the mass - flux diagram and have shown numerically that the number of branches increases and the location of shocks move to infinity as the surface tension decreases to zero .
we conclude by listing a number of open questions for further studies .
first , it is suggested by the numerical computations that the number of solution branches goes to infinity as @xmath14 but computations become difficult and unreachable for @xmath142 .
second , the steady state are expected to persist with respect to small inclinations of the cylinder @xcite but we do not include inclined cylinders in this work . finally , numerical discretizations on the adaptive ( variable ) grid can be developed further to resolve better the regularized shock solutions near the shock location .

"magnetoelectric materials allow one to tune both the electric polarization by an external magnetic field as well as the magnetic polarization by an electric field @xcite .
in particular , the control of magnetic order by an electric field has large application potential in the context of data storage , but in spite of strong efforts no suitable materials have been discovered for a long time @xcite . in the recently discovered multiferroic transition - metal oxides ferroelectric polarization arises from a complex  in most cases chiral  magnetic structure .
the ferroelectric polarization can be modified by an external magnetic field @xcite in these multiferroic materials .
the opposite direction is more difficult to study , as the complex antiferromagnetic order requires a microscopic technique directly probing the spin arrangement @xcite . using polarized neutron scattering
it has been shown in tbmno@xmath1 @xcite , licu@xmath2o@xmath2 @xcite and in mnwo@xmath0 @xcite that the chiral component ( i.e.  sense of rotation ) of the magnetic order can be poled by an electric field when cooling through the ferroelectric transition . however ,
the direct observation of the electric - field induced switching of the chiral magnetism in these spiral multiferroics has only been recently observed in measurements on multiferroic mnwo@xmath0 @xcite and ni@xmath1v@xmath2o@xmath3 @xcite , where full hysteresis cycles were recorded .
the space group of mnwo@xmath0 is @xmath4 ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 at 300  k ) .
mnwo@xmath0 undergoes a sequence of magnetic phase transitions @xcite .
below 13.5k an incommensurate spin density wave with collinear moments in the @xmath9-plane and propagation vector @xmath10 sets in ( af3 ) . below 12.3k
an additional @xmath11-component evolves and the moments order in an elliptical spiral ( af2 ) . below
7.5k @xcite the system orders again collinearly with moments in the @xmath9-plane but with a commensurate propagation vector @xmath12 ( af1 ) @xcite . at the transition to the non - collinear state ( af3 @xmath13 af2 )
spontaneous electric polarization parallel @xmath11 develops continuously . at the transition back into the collinear but anharmonic state ( af2 @xmath13 af1 )
the electric polarization disappears discontinuously @xcite .    .
the loops were recorded after field - cooling from 20k to 10k in @xmath14 .
note that the coercive field depends on the field applied during cooling .
arrows indicate the sequence of the hysteresis in the two cycles after cooling the sample in positive and negative electric field , respectively . ]
multiferroicity in mnwo@xmath0 can be explained by the inverse dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction @xcite .
the direction of the electric polarization @xmath15 is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the magnetic moments of manganese ions and @xmath19 points along the connection line of the corresponding ions @xcite .
summing up these contributions over all pairs of magnetic ions yields the total ferroelectric polarization , which in case of mnwo@xmath0  points along the @xmath11 direction .
while the microscopic coupling leading to multiferroic order seems well understood in mnwo@xmath0 as well as in the other chiral multiferroics , very little is known about the dynamics of the domain inversion . in this work we present investigations on the kinetics of electric - field induced switching of chiral magnetic structures in multiferroic mnwo@xmath0 .
we applied a stroboscopic technique combined with polarized neutron diffraction in order to investigate how fast the magnetic chirality adapts to an instantaneously switched electric field .
scattering experiments with polarized neutrons are ideally suited for studying magnetic structures with a non - vanishing term @xmath20 , as they give access to the so - called chiral term : @xmath21 .
we use the common right - handed coordinate system with orthogonal axes : @xmath22 , @xmath23 vertical , @xmath24 .
@xmath25 is the part of the three - dimensional magnetic structure factor ( i.e.the fourier coefficient of the magnetization density ) @xmath26 perpendicular to the scattering vector @xmath27 .
we define the chiral ratio as the quotient of chiral and total magnetic scattering at a given @xmath27 :    @xmath28    the chiral ratio can amount to @xmath291 in the case of an ideal helix and scattering vector parallel to the propagation vector , but in general it will be smaller even for the ideal helix .
the chiral ratio for a mono - domain sample can easily be calculated from the magnetic structure @xcite .
the deviation with the experiment then directly gives the distribution of the chiral domains .    with spherical polarization analysis it is possible to measure the scattering intensity @xmath30 for any directions of the incoming , index @xmath31 , and outgoing , index @xmath32 , neutron polarization . over - bars
indicate antiparallel neutron polarization . therefore also the rotation of neutron polarization can be analyzed .
the chiral ratio can be measured equally well in several channels of the neutron polarization matrix @xcite .
it can be detected in the spin - flip scattering with polarization parallel to the scattering vector : @xmath33 and @xmath34 yielding    @xmath35    as well as in transverse polarization channels @xcite .

neutron scattering experiments were performed on the two cold triple - axis spectrometers in12 and in14 at the institut laue langevin ( ill ) . on both instruments
a bender was set between the monochromator ( pyrolitic graphite ) and the sample in order to polarize the incoming neutron beam .
the polarization analysis of the scattered neutrons was performed with a heusler crystal . for the control of the neutron spin at the sample position a _ cryopadiii _
was installed on the in12 spectrometer . in total a high degree of polarization was achieved .
the flipping ratios measured on nuclear bragg reflections ( 0 2 0 ) and ( 1 0 -2 ) amount to 26 and 41 , respectively . the slightly lower precision of the polarization at lower scattering angle most likely arises from perturbations in the guide fields . for the second experiment on in14
a helmholtz - coil setup was used to control the neutron polarization which only allows longitudinal polarization analysis . for analyzing the chiral domains longitudinal
polarization is sufficient , as the chiral contribution can be isolated in the @xmath41 channel .
the idea of our measurement was to reverse an electric field and to detect the response of the magnetic structure as a function of time .
typical count rates in neutron scattering experiments range in the time - scale of seconds ( elastic ) to minutes ( inelastic scattering ) .
therefore studying the time dependence of a single process would not yield enough counting statistics . to overcome this challenge stroboscopic neutron - scattering techniques
were developed @xcite . with this method
it is possible to synchronize a periodical perturbation at the sample with the count rate of the neutron detector .
the signal from the detector is recorded in time slots by a multichannel scaler . in order to gain sufficient count rates for each time slot the measurement
is repeated periodically while the count rates of the individual time slots are accumulated .
this technique was installed on the cold triple - axis spectrometer _ in12 _ at the _ institut laue - langevin _ using the _ cryopadiii _ setup for spherical polarization analysis . for the study of the multiferroic domain switching in mnwo@xmath0  we applied a periodic electric field with rectangular time shape of amplitudes of about @xmath42 and half periods of typically 67.5
the electric field was applied by setting the flat single crystals ( thickness of the order of 1 - 2  mm ) between two aluminium plates , which were connected with the switchable high - voltage generator .
the time slots were in the range of ms . with the fast electronics and with the signal strength of about 1000 cnts / s , it is possible to get sufficient statistics for the entire time dependence within several minutes to an hour .
in the first experiment the domain kinetics was analyzed on the in12 spectrometer . by putting the sample between two large aluminium plates the electric field
was applied along the crystallographic @xmath11-axis , which is the direction of the spontaneous electric polarization @xcite .
the sample thickness amounts to 1.98 mm in this direction .
the sample was mounted in the @xmath43 scattering - plane in order to reach the incommensurate magnetic bragg peaks .
first we recorded static hysteresis loops in order to determine the field strength needed to reverse chiral domains and the chirality saturation that could be achieved , see fig .
[ hys ] . at the magnetic bragg peak @xmath44
the hysteresis loops were recorded after cooling the sample from 20k to 10k in an applied electric field of @xmath45kv / mm .
the maximal chirality is @xmath46 and can be fully reversed .
we find that the crystal develops a preferred chirality depending on the field direction which is applied during cooling from the paramagnetic phase .
a higher field is needed to force the sample in the not - preferred state and a lower field can reverse it into its preferred state .
this is in accordance with previous results on the control of multiferroic domains by varying an electric field at constant temperature@xcite .
we started studying the time dependence of the multiferroic domain inversion by switching an electric field of @xmath36 with a frequency of 8hz and by registering the @xmath47 and @xmath48 intensities at the same magnetic bragg peak as for the hysteresis loops .
we observed the domain relaxation in the temperature range from 12.5k to 7.5k .
the sample was first cooled from 20k to 12.5k in a field of + 1.2kv / mm .
three time - resolved curves at different temperatures are shown in fig .
[ schalten ] .
we see that it is possible to switch the magnetic chirality frequently between the two saturation values and we reach the same amplitude as for the static hysteresis loop .
no evidence for a change in the domain response was seen in these runs .
inspection of fig .
[ schalten ] immediately shows that the rise time is shorter when the system goes into its preferred state and longer when it is forced to the other state . at the temperatures closer to the upper and the lower boundaries of the ferroelectric phase the domains switch faster ( i.e. the rise times of the chiral ratios are smaller )
this qualitative analysis agrees with that obtained from other techniques studying the reversal of the ferroelectric domains .
second harmonic generation experiments also find a rather slow domain inversion at t=12  k @xcite as well as the comprehensive study by means of dielectric spectroscopy @xcite .
the dielectric response and this neutron diffraction study show faster response near the upper and the lower transitions .
while this behavior is expected for approaching the upper continuous transition , it is quite unexpected for the lower first - order transition .

@xmath52 is half the period .
@xmath53 are the characteristic rise times for the two field directions ( positive and negative , respectively ) . @xmath54 and @xmath55 describe the minimal and maximal chiralities that are obtained for the two field directions , respectively .
we discuss the relaxation on the basis of the avrami model , which corresponds to a simple domain growth @xcite .
for the two directions of the field inversion , the exponents @xmath37 and @xmath38 can be globally fitted for the whole temperature range yielding values of 1.21 and 1.63 for the faster and for the slower switching , respectively .
the characteristic time constants and the maximal chiral ratios recorded at all temperatures are shown in fig .  [ werteschalten ] .
the properties , which were already discussed at the three example runs ( fig .  [ schalten ] ) , are confirmed by the whole temperature dependence .    as reported previously @xcite ,
the multiferroic domain inversion in mnwo@xmath0  is rather slow , of the order of milliseconds to a few tens of milliseconds indicating that the domains in the multiferroic state are well pinned .
this is in accordance with the large coercive fields found in the quasi - static experiments @xcite .
the slow multiferroic rise times underline the importance of the lattice in the control of domains . for a purely structural domain
the finite sound velocity can limit the speed of domain inversion to below the quotient of thickness to sound velocity ( of the order of @xmath56s for a mm sized crystal ) , but this is not the limiting factor in mnwo@xmath0 . that we observe three orders of magnitude larger rise times indicates effective pinning .
our neutron experiment senses the chiral magnetic component that could in principle be decoupled from the total ferroelectric polarization during the domain inversion . the good agreement between the magnetic response and the dielectric one
@xcite clearly excludes such decoupling .
furthermore we always find a single relaxation ; there is no indication for some faster magnetic relaxation preceding slower ferroelectric domains .
this documents once more , that magnetism and ferroelectric polarization are strongly coupled in mnwo@xmath0 .
the precise reason for the slow domain inversion remains unclear .
since only tiny atomic displacements can be associated with the observed small ferroelectric polarization , it seems unlikely that strong pinning arises due to these purely ferroelectric displacements .
instead higher - order modulations appear more likely to be at the origin of the strong pinning . for a magnetic modulation
one can always expect a coupling with a structural modulation of half the magnetic period . in reference @xcite it was shown , that this half - period structural modulation is sizeable in mnwo@xmath0  and that it is accompanied by a second - order modulation of the magnetic structure .
the two modulations exhibit coherent interference underlining their tight coupling @xcite .
this structural distortion can possess a higher pinning potential than the weak ferroelectric distortion itself .
it is quite astonishing that domains switch again much faster when approaching the lower boundary of the multiferroic phase .
since this transition is of clear first order , one would not expect any slowing down of excitations , which could melt the pinning .
instead the lower transition is related to the anharmonic distortions of the magnetic modulation , which increase upon cooling in the multiferroic phase @xcite .
this increase is relatively stronger than that of the first - order magnetic modulation .
increasing anharmonicity may result in some depinning .
after this first series of experiments we tried to investigate whether we could change the preferred chirality by reversing the field during cooling .
we heated the sample to 20k and cooled it in a field of @xmath57 .
then we recorded the switching behavior in a temperature range from 12.5k to 7.5k .
three curves at different temperatures are shown in fig .
[ umgepolt ] .
as expected the sample now has a preference to negative chirality what is in accordance with the field applied during cooling . comparing the fit parameters of the two temperature runs ( fig .  [ werteschalten ] with fig .
[ werteumgepolt ] ) reveals reversed behavior .
now the negative chirality exceeds the positive chirality
. however the positive ( not preferred ) chirality shows a less smooth curve than before because the full saturation is not reached at all temperatures .
the behavior of the time constants is also reversed .
now the time needed to switch to the positive chirality exceeds the time needed to switch to the negative chirality .
we also observe that the rise time to switch to not preferred chirality became longer than that observed in the first series .    the reversal of the preferred orientation agrees with the pronounced memory effects reported in reference @xcite .
most likely the cooling with a large electric field freezes in some local fields which determine the preferential orientation of the multiferroic domains .
this leads to the strong asymmetries in the hysteresis cycles as well as in the time dependence of domain reversion .
the time - resolved measurement was repeated at the in14 spectrometer at the ill with a crystal grown in a different batch , in order to investigate which properties were specific to the sample and which ones are general .
the second sample was 0.89 mm thick .
for this experiment we used a conventional helmholtz setup for the polarization analysis as it provides a higher scattering intensity , and as the chiral component can be studied in the longitudinal @xmath41 channel .
the intensity of the magnetic reflection @xmath58 amounts to 1400 cnts / s , i.e.comparable to the first experiment in spite of the smaller sample volume .
first , we recorded a hysteresis loop after zero - field cooling the sample and thereby avoiding a freezing - in of electric fields , see fig .
[ in14data ] a ) . at 10
k a negative field of @xmath59 kv / mm was applied yielding a saturation value of the chiral ratio of 0.85 which is significantly higher than that for the first sample and indicates an almost perfect monodomain state ( 95% , comparable to earlier studies @xcite ) . nevertheless , the hysteresis loop is not perfectly symmetric but shows a clear preference for negative electric polarization which corresponds to the first field the crystal sensed after cooling .
crystals thus possess some intrinsic preference for the multiferroic state , whose origin requires further clarification . for the time - dependent studies we chose a field of @xmath291.35 kv / mm , which is sufficiently above the coercive fields in both directions .    .
the upper panel shows a multiferroic hysteresis loop of the chiral ratio recorded after zero - field cooling the crystal ; note that the loop still exhibits finite asymmetry .
the middle and lower panels show the results of time dependent measurements of the multiferroic switching .
the electric field is switched with a frequency of 8  hz and an amplitude of @xmath291.35  kv / mm .
the middle and lower rows show data after field - cooling the sample from 20 k in an electric field of + 1.35  kv / mm and -1.35  kv / mm , respectively . ]
the first set of time - dependent measurements was taken after field - cooling the sample from 20 k to 12 k with an electric field of + 1.35 kv / mm .
the electric field was modulated with a frequency of 8 hz and an amplitude of @xmath291.35  kv / mm , and time - resolved data were recorded every 0.5  k down to 7.5  k. three characteristic time scans are shown in fig .
[ in14data ] b)-d ) .
the reproducibility of the results was verified by raising the temperature to 20 k and field - cooling the sample again and by taking data with 1  k steps .
the obtained data are perfectly reproducible in these two runs indicating in particular the absence of fatigue , see fig .
the entire procedure was repeated with this second crystal but starting with field - cooling in a negative field of @xmath60 kv / mm .
characteristic time scans are shown in fig .
[ in14data ] e)-g ) and the results of the relaxation description are given in fig .
[ in14fit ] . in this
run the sample develops a clear preference for negative fields and shows more asymmetric behavior .
the sign of the asymmetry agrees with the one observed after zero - field cooling of the virgin crystal and therefore seems to be intrinsic to this crystal .
the rise times in the favorable negative field direction of this run are faster than those in the previous run , and the rise times in the unfavorable positive field direction are even slower than the previous ones .
so , the field - cooling in negative fields seems to enhance the natural asymmetry of this crystal , while field - cooling in the opposite field seems to reduce it thereby yielding an almost symmetric state .
however , all the general aspects of the rise times with maximum times near 10  k are again observed . in this last run
the rise times in the unfavorable direction became too long to reach saturation , therefore the amplitude in the unfavorable direction diminishes towards low temperatures and exhibits a minimum around 10  k.    the time - resolved data were again analyzed with the relaxation formula ( 2 ) .
the exponents @xmath11 of the stretched exponentials could be fitted globally for all temperatures or individually without significant differences in the rise times ; they amount to 1.67/1.32 and 1.43/1.36 in the slow / fast switching processes in the first and second sequence , respectively , so that it actually is a compressed exponential behavior .
although the stretching exponent clearly depends on sample history and on the direction of the field switch the average value agrees for the two samples and the various histories studied .
the average stretching exponent is found at 1.4 .
this exponent can be interpreted within the frame - work proposed by ishibashi and takagi @xcite .
the exponent corresponds to the dimensionality of the domain growth enhanced by one for the case of constant continuous nucleation .
therefore our data suggests a low - dimensional domain growth as it is typically observed in ferroelectrics . a distribution of pinning properties and of local rise times will decrease the fitted exponent thereby weakening the conclusion of one - dimensional domain growth , but a large exponent that is reduced by severe spread of rise times is inconsistent with our time domain data .
performed on the in14 spectrometer with a thin sample .
the left panel shows the chiral amplitude of the hysteresis cycles , that could be controlled as function of temperatures ; the right panel shows the rise times of these hysteresis cycles as function of temperature for the two direction of electric - field inversion .
empty symbols belong to the repeated measurement and proof the reproducibility of the data . in total four temperature dependencies of the rise time
were performed corresponding to an initial field cooling in positive or negative fields ( labelled by @xmath61 and @xmath62 in the legend ) and to relaxation in positive and negative fields , labelled by 1 and 2 , respectively . ]    in fig .
[ in14fit ] the rise times and amplitudes of all measurements with the second setup are combined as function of temperature .
qualitatively , these values agree with the results of the first experiment , see fig .
[ werteschalten ] and [ werteumgepolt ] , but there is less difference between the up and down field directions and the rise times are slightly shorter in general .
the controlled chiral component remains close to the ideal value over the entire temperature range in the second sample .
also this sample shows the faster domain response when approaching the upper and the lower boundaries of the ferroelectric phase .
additionally , the second sample displays a weak long - time - scale relaxation process which can be observed at 8 k and 10 k in fig .
[ in14data ] .
the main part of the chiral ration adapts to the new field in less than 10 ms , but then the chiral ratio still increases with a much lower time scale .
this behavior was not observed with the other sample studied on in12 , which , however , could be switched to a lesser extent .
due to the different initial poling ( parallel and antiparallel to the intrinsic preference of the crystal ) and due to the two field directions there are in total four different configurations to be considered for each of the two crystals , see the combined plot in the right panel of fig . 7 . if we average these four curves we determine rise times of 2.5 , 10.5 and 3.6  ms at 12 , 9.5 and 7.5k , respectively , for the second crystal , while the rise times of the first crystal amount to 3.6 , 15 , and 4.5  ms at the same temperatures .
the slightly slower domain reversion ( roughly a factor 1.5 ) in the first crystal can be attributed to the lower applied field ( see discussion below ) so that the two sets of measurements agree quite well with each other . by averaging the four possible configurations one finds the intrinsic domain properties for this type of crystals .
note , that the two crystals were obtained from different growth processes but using the same technique @xcite .      with the first experimental setup on in12 we investigated the influence of the amplitude of the switching field by applying 1.2 , 1.35 , and 1.5kv / mm with a constant repetition rate of 8  hz ,
see fig .
[ amplituden ] .
the difference for the three applied amplitudes can be easily analyzed : if we switch from the not preferred state to the preferred state ( i.e. the rapid process ) the field of 1.2kv / mm already largely exceeds the minimal required field ( i.e. the coercive field of the preferred state ) . the maximal chirality and
the stretching exponents stay almost the same for all three fields , but the rise time diminishes with increasing electric field . if we switch into the not - preferred state more drastic changes occur as function of electric field .
the domain distribution reaches lower saturation values at smaller fields , and , more importantly , the rise - times decrease more rapidly than the inverse of the electric field , see fig .
this e - field dependence of the rise times allows us to overlay the multiferroic domain behavior in the two distinct crystals .
in addition , we investigated the effect of the frequency on the switching behavior . at 10k we switched at the following frequencies ( chronological order ) : 10 , 12 , 5 , 8 , 20 , and 40hz .
the measured curves at 5 , 10 , 20 , and 40hz are shown in fig .
[ frequenz ] .
the system behaves as expected for a preferred state which is imprinted by the first cooling in strong applied electric fields .
when we switch faster than the system is able to respond to , the saturation value of the chiral component is not reached in that field direction .
the dielectric studies also observe incomplete domain switching depending on frequency and temperature@xcite .
the rise times in our experiment , however , do not essentially change within the studied frequency range .    during the entire sequence of experiments with the first setup we realized that the sample exhibits some fatigue .
we compare runs which were done at 10k and 8hz with different histories of the sample . as reference
we use the run which was taken in the beginning of the measurement during the first temperature scan of rise - time experiments . at this first time the chirality could be flipped almost as large as in the static cycle ( + 0.49 , @xmath63 ) at @xmath64 , see fig .
[ schalten ] . later , after the sample had been switched with 12hz for long time and after thermal cycling , the preferred chirality almost stayed the same ( + 0.48 ) but the not preferred chirality decreased to @xmath65 , see fig .
[ frequenz ] for @xmath66 . after taking the entire frequency dependence , ending with switching at 40  hz
, all parameters stay more or less the same .
this indicates a general fatigue mechanism due to the switching and the thermal cycling rather than a destruction of the sample by applying a too high frequency . after the observation of fatigue effects , we heated the sample to 20k and cooled it again
. however , the sample did not restore to its initial behavior .
so we heated the sample to 120k in the hope that such procedure would restore the sample , however , this was not accomplished .
the repeated switching seems to induce defects influencing magnetic and polar order which do not heal when going far beyond the magnetic phase transition . with the second setup
no fatigue was observed , as described above .    .
the system clearly shows a preferred state . at high frequencies the time is too short to reach saturation in the not - preferred state .
the data are shifted in the time axis such that the time of the switch coincides for the different frequencies ( data taken with first experimental setup after cooling in positive field ) . ]
in conclusion the time scales of controlling the magnetic chiral components by an external electric field have been studied by time - resolved polarized neutron diffraction experiments . by comparing comprehensive measurements with two different samples and with different poling history
we can identify the general features of the domain switching and those which depend on the sample and on its thermal history .
in general the rise times to invert the magnetic components are slow , typically of the order of a few to several tens of milliseconds .
this agrees with a measurement of second harmonic generation and in particular with a comprehensive study by dielectric spectroscopy .
the magnetic response can be described by single relaxation process ( only in one case we find evidence for a superposed even slower domain relaxation ) and there is no indication for a fast process .
we always find a weakly enhanced stretching exponent .
the reversal of domains seem to be essentially controlled by a single process type which preserves the tight coupling between magnetic chirality and ferroelectric polarization .
the chiral magnetism can not be reversed faster than the ferroelectric polarization .
the peculiar temperature dependence of the rise times with a maximum around 10  k also is a general feature of the domain kinetics in mnwo@xmath0 . the faster response is naturally expected when approaching the upper phase transition , where ferroelectricity and the chiral components disappear continuously associated with softer excitations
. however , the faster kinetics near the lower first - order phase transition is astonishing and possibly related to the increase of the anharmonic modulations upon cooling in the multiferroic phase .
the second- and higher - order modulations of both , the nuclear and the crystal structure can be relevant for the effective pinning of domains in mnwo@xmath0 .
the independent measurement on crystals of two different batches yield good agreement concerning the qualitative temperature dependence and even quantitative agreement when considering the average of the four possibilities of the electric field ( relaxation field and initial poling ) and taking the field strength into account .
the sign and the size of the asymmetries , which are seen in the rise times , in the saturation chiral component or in the coercive fields , clearly are sample and history dependent . even after zero - field cooling
, a finite asymmetry persists indicating an intrinsic property of the sample .
field cooling from higher temperatures seems to imprint stronger polar preferences , which can be reverted @xcite by different thermal cycling .

we thank j.  stein and j.  hemberger for valuable discussions .
while there is perfect agreement concerning the upper two magnetic transition temperatures , the first order transition between af1 and af2 phases seems to slightly depend on the sample , see c. tlzer diploma thesis ( university of cologne 2012 , unpublished ) ." ," the time dependence of switching multiferroic domains in mnwo@xmath0 has been studied by time - resolved polarized neutron diffraction . inverting an external electric field inverts the chiral magnetic component within rise times ranging between a few and some tens of milliseconds in perfect agreement with macroscopic techniques . 
 there is no evidence for any faster process in the inversion of the chiral magnetic structure . 
 the time dependence is well described by a temperature - dependent rise time suggesting a well - defined process of domain reversion . as expected , the rise times decrease when heating towards the upper boundary of the ferroelectric phase . however , switching also becomes faster upon cooling towards the lower boundary , which is associated with a first - order phase transition .

lett . 61 ( 1988 ) 1453 ." ," the decays @xmath0 and @xmath1 are studied at the leading order @xmath2 in chiral perturbation theory . 
 one - loop contributions stemming from the odd intrinsic parity @xmath3 effective lagrangian of order @xmath4 are included and shown to be of possible relevance . 
 they affect the decay @xmath0 adding to the usual pole terms a piece free of counterterm uncertainties . in the case of 
 the @xmath1 decays the dependence of the form factor on the dilepton invariant mass requires a counterterm . 
 the form factor may receive a sizeable contribution from chiral logarithms . including considerations from the @xmath5 direct emission amplitude , we obtain two consistent scenarios . in one scenario 
 the long distance contributions from the one - loop terms are important , while in the other they are marginal . in both cases the counterterm is shown to be significant .    
 = 10000    jlab - thy-97 - 06    the radiative decays of the long lived neutral k meson , @xmath6 , have been the subject of numerous theoretical analyses , in chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath7pt)@xmath8 . among these decays , the decay @xmath9 and the dalitz decays @xmath10 still show open issues which we address in this paper . 
 both types of decays proceed at order @xmath2 in @xmath7pt . 
 the pole - type terms given by @xmath11 and the @xmath12 intermediate states@xmath13 are individually of leading order @xmath4 , but their added contribution cancels at this order due to the gell - mann - okubo relation@xmath14 and is in effect of order @xmath2 . 
 it is , therefore , important to perform a complete analysis of the decays at this order . 
 we show that the one - loop terms of order @xmath2 stemming from the odd - intrinsic parity terms of the @xmath3 non - leptonic effective hamiltonian of order @xmath4 and not previously evaluated , affect both types of decays in a potentially significant way . 
 we find , in particular , a contribution to the amplitude of the two - gamma decay proportional to @xmath15 that can be a substantial addition to the pole - type term . in the case of the dalitz decays , the experimentally observed non - trivial form factor in terms of the dilepton invariant mass is usually described using the vmd model of bergstrm , mass and singer @xmath16 , which gives a satisfactory parameterization . 
 the work of ko@xmath17 provides a thorough study of vmd in radiative decays . 
 recently , other models like the factorization model ( fm ) and the weak deformation model ( wdm ) have been considered as well@xmath18 . 
 our calculation includes long distance pieces given by the chiral loops , and a short distance piece due to a counterterm needed to renormalize the loops is determined by fitting to the data . for our purpose , 
 the experimental situation is good . 
 the two - gamma mode is experimentally very precisely known : br(@xmath9)= @xmath19 @xmath20 . 
 the branching ratios of the dalitz decays are on the other hand known within @xmath21 : @xmath22 ( na31@xmath23 and bnl - e845@xmath24 collaborations ) , and @xmath25 ( e799 collaboration@xmath26 ) . 
 the rate of the @xmath27 mode is about @xmath28 larger than it would be for the case of a point - like form factor . 
 the form factor also shows up clearly in dilepton invariant mass distribution of both modes . using this data and some input from the @xmath29 decay@xmath30 , we are able to two phenomenologically acceptable scenarios .    
 we work in the standard framework of @xmath7pt . 
 the octet of pseudoscalar mesons is parameterized by the su(3 ) matrix @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the pion decay constant in the chiral limit . for the processes we consider the only gauge couplings we need are those to the em field . 
 we thus denote : @xmath33 ,   \end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath34 is the quark charge matrix .    
 we need the strong interaction effective chiral lagrangian up to order @xmath4@xmath35 , including , of course , em couplings and the wess - zumino ( wz ) lagrangian . 
 the non - leptonic @xmath36 effective chiral lagrangian is also required up to order @xmath4@xmath37 . 
 it contains an 8 and a 27 of su(3 ) ; we advocate the @xmath38 rule to disregard the marginal effects of the 27 piece . 
 the octet piece of order @xmath39 is @xmath40 where @xmath41 is given by @xmath42 here @xmath43 , @xmath44 are the sine and the cosine of ckm angles in the kobayashi - maskawa representation , and @xmath45 is an effective low energy coupling . at order @xmath4 
 there is a long list of terms ( forty eight octet terms when external sources of different kinds are included ) @xmath37 . 
 the relevant terms to us are those that affect the virtual transitions @xmath46 , including terms that break su(3 ) symmetry due to the quark masses , and terms that give the amplitudes @xmath47 and @xmath48 . 
 the first are contained in the terms bilinear in the meson fields of the @xmath49 lagrangian@xmath37 , and the second are given by odd - intrinsic parity terms of which only two combinations of the operators @xmath50 in@xmath37 appear , namely , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 . 
 the piece of the lagrangian @xmath53 containing these two terms can be written as follows@xmath30 :    @xmath54)+    a_4 \ , { \rm tr } ( \lambda\ , l _ { \nu } ) \ ; { \rm tr } ( ( \tilde{f } _ { l } ^ { \mu \nu }     - u^ { \dagger } \tilde{f } _ { r } ^ { \mu \nu } u ) l _ { \nu } ) \right\}+{\rm h.c.}\ ] ]    where @xmath55 . in our case , where the only external gauge field of relevance is the em field , we have @xmath56 , and @xmath57 is its dual . since the lagrangians of order @xmath39 are of even intrinsic parity , they alone can not generate odd intrinsic parity terms . 
 therefore , the low energy couplings @xmath58 and @xmath59 are renormalization - scale independent .    in the absence of cp 
 violation @xmath6 coincides with the cp - odd state @xmath60 , and the pieces of @xmath61 leading to the transitions @xmath62 and @xmath63 are explicitly : @xmath64 \;\partial _ { \rho }   a _ { \sigma }   ~~ , \nonumber \\   { \cal { l } } _ { k_{l } \rightarrow\pi ^{+ } \pi ^{- } \gamma \gamma    }   & = & - \frac { e^{2 } } { 8 \pi ^{2 } f_{0}^{3 } } \ ; c_{8 } \ ; \epsilon ^ { \mu \nu \rho \sigma } \ ; [ a_{2}\ , k_{l } \ , 
 \partial _ 
 { \mu } a _ { \nu } \nonumber \\   & - & 2\ , a_{4}\ , \partial _ { \mu } k_{l } \,a _ { \nu } ] \ ;   \partial _ { \rho } a _ { \sigma } \ 
 , \pi ^{+ } \pi ^{- } + ... \end{aligned}\ ] ] in the second lagrangian we do not display terms that do not contribute in our calculation .    
 the su(3 ) singlet meson @xmath65 , being a massive state due to the @xmath66 anomaly , can be integrated out or , equivalently , included explicitly in a meson pole dominance model@xmath67 . 
 the @xmath65 contribution to the decays is naturally of order @xmath2 . 
 since @xmath65 and @xmath68 mix with each other due to su(3 ) breaking , we find it more convenient to include @xmath65 explicitly . 
 we need to consider both , the terms that contribute to the virtual transition @xmath69 as well as the wz term , which leads to the standard amplitude for @xmath70 . 
 the mixing angle between the @xmath71 mesons and the decay constants as obtained from their two - gamma decays and the @xmath72 result for @xmath73@xmath35 are : @xmath74 the virtual weak amplitude @xmath75 is not known , and is characterized in the following by a parameter @xmath76 .    in the limit of cp conservation , the @xmath77 amplitude has the most general form : @xmath78 here @xmath79 is a virtual photon , and @xmath80 . 
 the branching ratio for the two - gamma decay mode is @xmath81 and the dilepton distribution of the dalitz decays is given by @xmath82 where @xmath83 , @xmath84 is the mass of the lepton , and @xmath85    there are two different sets of diagrams contributing to @xmath86 . 
 the first set are the pole terms shown in figures 1 and 2 involving the virtual transitions @xmath87 followed by the two - photon decay modes driven by the wz term . 
 the second set of diagrams , shown in figure 2 , requires the weak interaction transitions @xmath29 and @xmath88 .    as mentioned before 
 , the @xmath49 contributions due to the @xmath11 and @xmath68 poles cancel each other due to the gell - mann - okubo ( gmo ) relation@xmath14 . at @xmath89 one - loop corrections and counterterms 
 must be considered . from this 
 various effects result . 
 one is due to the deviation from the gmo relation , which is taken into account by replacing the lowest order masses by the physical masses . 
 another one is due to su(3 ) breaking in virtual amplitudes @xmath90 with respect to @xmath91 , which we take into account by means of the parameter @xmath92 below . 
 a final effect stems from the one - loop corrections to the wz term . as shown in@xmath93 , 
 there is a @xmath94 independent piece that is taken into account by simply replacing the decay constants in the chiral limit by the physical decay constants , while the @xmath94 dependent piece requires renormalization . 
 fortunately , the latter only appears in contributions to the @xmath95 decay of order @xmath96 , and can therefore be altogether disregarded . 
 the reason is that the @xmath94-dependent corrections to the wz term have the same relative weight for the @xmath11 and @xmath12 as in the wz term itself@xmath93 , and therefore the mechanism of cancellation by the gmo relation eliminates the order @xmath2 terms . 
 since the @xmath97 contribution is already of order @xmath2 at tree level , the one loop corrections are of order @xmath96 and , therefore , disregarded . from this , the pole piece of @xmath86 can be expressed as follows@xmath67 : @xmath98 where @xmath99 we emphasize that @xmath100 is very sensitive to the parameteres @xmath76 and @xmath92 , and therefore , can not be reliably predicted .      
 only the @xmath94-dependent piece needs renormalization provided by the counterterm @xmath108 . 
 the t - independent uv divergencies cancel when the two diagrams in figure 2 are added . 
 the t - dependent piece needs renormalization that is , as usual , accomplished by replacing in ( 14 ) @xmath109 plus the term proportional to @xmath110 by @xmath111 . 
 as shown later , this counterterm can be estimated by analyzing the data . 
 therefore , @xmath112 is unaffected by counterterm uncertainties , and is non - vanishing and proportional to @xmath15 . 
 this term is thus a new addition to the @xmath9 amplitude . 
 notice that one can write a finite counterterm for the @xmath113 piece . 
 such a counterterm is included in @xmath100 , and in the pole model it is given by the @xmath97 intermediate state as already discussed . 
 the situation here resembles that of the strong interaction case at order @xmath4 , where the term proportional to the low energy constant @xmath114 only provides a finite renormalization , and is in fact dominated by the @xmath97 pole@xmath35 . 
 the @xmath94 independent pieces of @xmath86 vanish in the chiral limit in accordance with the veltman - sutherland theorem .    
 the unknown parameters affecting the two - photon and dalitz modes are @xmath115 and @xmath116 , while the counterterm @xmath111 only affects the dalitz mode . 
 when we neglect the t - dependence in @xmath117 , ( 10 ) gives @xmath118 and the ratios with the experimental values are @xmath20 : @xmath119 thus , ( 17 ) is an excellent approximation in the @xmath120 mode , where most of the rate is given by the low - t domain where the relative t - dependence is very small , while in the @xmath27 case @xmath121 is large enough for the @xmath94-dependence to be noticeable . 
 thus , on the basis of the total rate of the @xmath27 dalitz mode it is clear that there is a significant @xmath94-dependence in @xmath117 , as was first experimentally noticed by the e799 collaboration @xmath26 . denoting for the sake of convenience , @xmath122 from the ratio @xmath123 we find that they are approximately linearly related as @xmath124 with this relation we also find an excellent fit to both dilepton invariant mass distributions@xmath125 . 
 as expected , the dalitz decays alone can not pin - down @xmath126 and the counterterm . 
 it is necessary to invoke further observables for this to be possible . 
 the value of @xmath126 can also be estimated by means of two other processes , namely , @xmath9 and @xmath127 . 
 the amplitude of the first process is given in terms of @xmath128 with @xmath129 from the @xmath9 width ( 9 ) this combination has the value @xmath130 . on the other hand , the second process permits a model dependent estimate of a different combination@xmath30 , namely , @xmath131 while in ( 21 ) both terms are of the same chiral order , in ( 22 ) the first term is of lower order than the second . 
 indeed , @xmath126 gives the strength of the direct emission @xmath132 amplitude of order @xmath4 , while the second term appears in the correction of order @xmath2 to that amplitude@xmath30 . 
 there is , in addition , the theoretically well known internal bremsstrahlung amplitude of order @xmath39 that is cp violating and can not interfere with the direct emission one because it is of electric type . 
 thus , the direct emission decay rate can be cleanly identified , and the combination in ( 22 ) is then estimated to be in the interval 0.3 to 0.9 @xmath30 . 
 the positive sign of the combination is favored by a factorization model@xmath30 , but the possibility of a negative sign is not altogether ruled out . for a similar negative interval the conclusions we draw here remain unchanged . 
 taking the estimated range at face value , we obtain @xmath126 and @xmath133 for the two possible signs of @xmath134 as shown in the table . 
 a first consequence is that the amplitude for the two - gamma decay has a potentially important addition beyond the pole terms , depending on the scenario , defined by the sign of @xmath135 , one considers . 
 this is shown in the table by the ratio @xmath136 , which can be as large as @xmath137 .    
 the slope of the dalitz decay form factor defined by @xmath138 is consistent with the experimental value obtained from the @xmath120 mode , @xmath139@xmath140 . 
 in fact , in the acceptable range of @xmath126 ( 20 ) gives @xmath141 . 
 we notice that the chiral logarithm terms as well as the counterterm give positive contributions to the slope . 
 the fraction of the slope due to the counterterm is shown in the last entry of the table . 
 we see that in one case it is dominating , giving support to the vmd model@xmath16 , while in the other case there are important chiral logarithm terms as well .    
 since the @xmath27 mode shows more prominently the t - dependence , the results are mostly determined by that mode . in turn , for the @xmath142 mode we predict @xmath143 . 
 this ratio is consistent within the @xmath144 error of the experimental result ( 18 ) .    in conclusion , 
 our leading order analysis shows two acceptable scenarios . 
 in one of them there are sizeable long distance contributions from one - loop diagrams to both types of radiative decays considered , while in the other such contributions are small , implying that vmd models are an excellent picture . 
 the question of which of the two scenarios is actually realized is clearly important . "
"the study of extended sources in gravitational theories has a rich literature behind it .
a full understanding of the spectrum is necessary , among other things , to attain a consistent partition function .
a notable example of this assertion is the case of anti - de sitter ( ads ) gravity in three dimensions with negative cosmological constant , whose spectrum contains btz black holes @xcite and conical defects ( well - behaved naked singularities that admit the interpretation of point particles ) @xcite , but no propagating gravitons .
still , the euclidean path integral with only smooth manifold contributions does not lead to a sensible quantum gravity partition function ; seemingly , there may be additional contributions that require the introduction of point - like sources @xcite .
this is precisely the class of configurations we aim to explore in the present article .
any configuration in three - dimensional ads gravity that has constant curvature arises from identifications of ads space by a discrete one - parameter subgroup of @xmath0 generated by a killing vector @xcite .
the construction of black holes by identifications in ads space can be extended to higher dimensions . if the identifications do not have fixed points , they produce _ topological _ ads black holes .
they have been constructed , for instance , in @xmath1 @xcite , @xmath2 @xcite , and higher dimensions @xcite . on the other hand ,
if the identifications do have fixed points , they produce cone - like singularities whose consistent interpretation demands the introduction of explicit source terms in the lagrangian , localized at their singular _
loci_. even in a three - dimensional theory , these singularities correspond to topological defects at the positions of external current insertions that couple in a gauge - invariant way to three - dimensional ads gravity .
the angular deficit at the singularities account for the negative part of the btz mass spectrum @xcite , filling the gap between the vacuum and the massless btz black hole .
it may seem surprising that those identifications leading to cone - like or dirac delta function singularities are particularly interesting .
they describe codimension - two branes in gravity theories in any dimension and , in particular , 0-branes in three dimensions . by construction , these are locally constant curvature geometries except at isolated codimension - two hypersurfaces whose presence modify the topology of loops and closed surfaces in the ambient spacetime . in all cases ,
the codimension - two branes represent localized sources not covered by event horizons .
since these configurations are built from geometrical considerations that do not rely on dynamics , they might a priori arise in many different theories .
nonetheless , they can be naturally accommodated within a suitable framework where they become extended sources for gauge theories of gravity , such as chern - simons ( cs ) theories @xcite .
the nature of the conserved charges , as well as the stability of these branes , do depend on the action , since the fluctuations of geometry around the solutions depend on the full set of field equations . in order to study the stability of the spinning branes , we consider cs ads supergravity actions @xcite . as we will discuss in this article ,
the framework is possibly broader than this , though the only explicit realizations we have considered here are cs theories of ( super)gravity @xcite .
the advantage of these gravitation theories is that they are _ gauge _ theories of gravity and that the interaction between the external sources ( @xmath3-branes ) and the gauge connection can be incorporated in the action in a background - independent , metric - free and gauge invariant way @xcite .
this coupling between branes and non - abelian gauge connections generalizes the minimal coupling that describes the interaction between a point charge ( 0-brane ) and the @xmath4 gauge connection @xcite . besides
, these theories have many amenable features such as an off - shell formulation with the symmetries dictated by the m - algebra @xcite .
to be more concrete , the kind of gravitational theories under consideration in the present paper are those that can be written in terms of a gauge connection .
we will use the first order formalism , in which the gravitational fields are the vielbein 1-form , @xmath5 , and the spin - connection 1-form , @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) .
they can be written altogether as components of the ads gauge connection @xmath8 with the ads generators @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) , where @xmath11 .
the riemann curvature 2-form , @xmath12 , and the torsion 2-form , @xmath13 , are the components of the ads curvature ( field - strength ) , @xmath14 the flat connection , @xmath15 , corresponds to a torsion - free , global ads@xmath16 spacetime .
we are interested in configurations defined on a @xmath17-dimensional manifold @xmath18 described by the equation @xmath19 where the sources @xmath20 are localized at codimension - two surfaces embedded in the @xmath17-dimensional spacetime .
the 2-form currents must be covariantly conserved , @xmath21 , and they represent ( @xmath22)-branes sweeping codimension - two histories . since @xmath23 vanishes almost everywhere , except on some submanifold of measure zero , these branes produce locally ads spacetimes , that could be solutions of any gravitation theory with negative cosmological constant that admits global ads solutions . apart from cs ads gravity , these include standard einstein - hilbert ads gravity , or higher - dimensional generalization of general relativity described by lovelock gravities @xcite .
a similar procedure was employed to obtain locally flat geometries by identifications of minkowski space in the framework of einstein - hilbert gravity , leading to stationary , axisymmetric solutions with sources in the form of rods along a line @xcite ( for a review , see @xcite ) .
as mentioned above , in some gravities it might be difficult to identify a coupling in the action whose field equations possess @xmath24 as a particular solution . in @xmath25 dimensions , there is at least one gauge - invariant coupling that gives rise to this kind of interaction with a codimension - two source , @xmath26 here , @xmath27 is a coupling constant , @xmath28 is the trace taken in the algebra of some gauge group that contains ads and @xmath29 is the chern - simons form that satisfies @xmath30 , where @xmath31 denotes the wedge product of @xmath32 field - strength 2-forms .
this coupling can be added , for example , to ( @xmath33)-dimensional cs ads gravity , @xmath34 the resulting field equations , @xmath35 , have @xmath24 as a particular solution .    for the sake of concreteness , whenever we need to specify an action ( for example , in order to study the stability of the solution ) , we shall focus to cs ads gravity @xmath36=i_{\text{cs}}+i_{\text{int}}$ ] , coupled to the sources in the form ( [ interaction ] ) .
in this section we consider three - dimensional ads space and show how a spinning @xmath37-brane can be obtained from identifications in this space .
the construction is analogous to the one that yields the spinning black hole in three dimensions @xcite .
this method was employed to construct the static 0-brane ( point particle ) in 3 dimensions @xcite , yielding particle solutions whose mass spectrum extends the black hole mass parameter to negative values .
the procedure of boosting the static @xmath37-brane , along the lines of @xcite , provides a natural physical interpretation of the parameters that enter in the construction of the spinning branes .
let us start by reviewing the construction of the static @xmath37-brane .
ads@xmath38 space can be seen as a hyperboloid in @xmath39 , where the cartesian coordinates @xmath40 are subjected to the constraint @xmath41 . here
, @xmath42 is the ads radius and @xmath43 . using the parameterization @xmath44 x^{3}=a\sin \phi
_ { 03}\ , , & x^{2}=b\sin \phi _ { 12}\ , , \end{array } \label{3dstatic}\ ] ] the ads@xmath45 space corresponds to the surface @xmath46 the ads@xmath45 metric then reads @xmath47 note that by unwrapping the @xmath48 coordinate , the global covering of ads@xmath45 in polar coordinates is obtained and closed time - like curves are eliminated . the static 0-brane can be constructed as a topological defect in the ( 1 - 2)-plane by introducing a deficit in the @xmath49 angle @xcite @xmath50 the periodicity of @xmath49 is thus @xmath51 .
the metric , with this identification , reads @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 .
compared with the btz black hole , the parameter @xmath55 is seen to play the role of the ( negative ) mass . the spacetime geometry given by ( [ static - polar ] ) has constant riemann curvature and vanishing torsion everywhere , except at @xmath56 . on the other hand ,
the conical singularity at @xmath56 is the locus of the static @xmath37-brane , where infinite curvature is concentrated .
this dirac delta distribution has support in the center of the @xmath57-plane , that is the ( 1 - 2)-plane in the covering space @xmath39 , and we shall call it the 2-manifold @xmath58 . including the singular point , the ads curvature ( [ ads_curvatrure ] ) can then be written as @xmath24 , where the source is given by the current 2-form @xmath59 we have defined the dirac delta distribution 2-form that is coordinate - independent , @xmath60      in the _ non - extremal _ case , the massive spinning 0-brane can be obtained from the global ads metric ( [ ads metric ] ) by an identification produced by a linear combination of the killing vectors @xmath61 and @xmath62 .
this procedure closely follows the one described in ref.@xcite to construct the btz black hole .
consider two angular deficits in the @xmath63- and @xmath64-planes in @xmath39 , @xmath65 the choice of real constants @xmath66 and @xmath67 is not unique since these parameters can be shifted by integers .
we choose @xmath68 $ ] and note that @xmath69 means that there is no angular deficit .
this identification in @xmath39 corresponds to an identification in ads@xmath38 space by some angle @xmath70 , what can be made explicit by redefining the coordinates as @xmath71 where @xmath70 is periodic with period @xmath72 .
the transformation is invertible if @xmath73 .
then , @xmath74 induces the following identification in @xmath39 , @xmath75 or , in an infinitesimal form , @xmath76 the identification is produced by the killing vector @xmath77 & = & 2\pi a\,\partial _ { \phi _ { 12}}+2\pi b\,\partial _ { \phi _ { 03}}\,,\label{nonextreml killing}\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath78 are generators of rotations in @xmath39 , and @xmath79 according to the classification given in ref.@xcite , this killing vector is of the type * * i**@xmath80 when @xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) , and of type * * ii**@xmath83 when @xmath84 .
thus , this geometry belongs to a sector topologically different from the btz black hole , produced by identifications of type * * i**@xmath83 ( @xmath85 , @xmath86 ) and type * * ii**@xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) .    using the ortho - normality of the tangent vectors , @xmath89 , the norm of the killing vector @xmath90 reads @xmath91 \,,\ ] ] which is valid for any @xmath66 and @xmath67 .
however , notice that if @xmath92 , the norm @xmath93 is a time - like vector , and since it identifies different points in our geometry , it would lead to closed time - like curves .
therefore , we assume @xmath94 , @xmath95 after implementing the identification , the metric ( [ ads metric ] ) becomes @xmath96 in sum , the metric ( [ boosted metric ] ) is obtained from global ads by the transformation ( [ covering identification ] ) and simultaneous identifications of the embedding angles @xmath48 and @xmath49 .
alternatively , this metric with @xmath97 and @xmath98 can be re - interpreted as the static @xmath37-brane with angular defect @xmath99 , whose spin is introduced by boosting the azimuthal angle @xmath100 with the velocity @xmath101 , similarly to the construction in ref.@xcite for the spinning charged black hole .    indeed , if @xmath102 , we can always write @xmath103 , where @xmath104 $ ] , and parameterize the constants @xmath66 and @xmath67 in terms of a hyperbolic angle @xmath105 as @xmath106 and @xmath107 . then , @xmath108 can be re - interpreted as the rapidity of some lorentz transformation with velocity @xmath109 , @xmath101 , so that the original angular deficits are related to the boost velocity as @xmath110 now , the relations ( [ angles ] ) with @xmath97 and @xmath98 are equivalent to a single lorentz boost @xmath111 acting on the static @xmath37-brane , @xmath112 note that this interpretation is possible only for @xmath102 ( @xmath113 ) which means that the brane is not extremal , and allows for the identification in the @xmath114-plane as @xmath115 .
the limit @xmath116 recovers the static brane ( @xmath117 , @xmath118 ) .
thus , @xmath67 is related to the angular momentum of the brane .
although the original static metric describes a manifold with a conical singularity , the addition of angular momentum makes the manifold regular , its curvature being constant everywhere @xcite .
this spacetime , however , has a _ causal horizon _ ,
the surface @xmath119 , where the norm of the killing vector field ( [ 3d_kv ] ) vanishes .
the component @xmath120 of the metric also vanishes there , though its positivity should guarantee that @xmath70 is an angle .    in the exterior region , @xmath121 ,
the vector field @xmath90 is space - like and the causal structure is well - defined . in the interior region , @xmath122 , @xmath90 becomes time - like allowing closed time - like curves .
this region of spacetime can be removed by introducing a new radial coordinate @xmath123 , such that @xmath124 is always non - negative , or @xmath125 where the above transformation is valid for @xmath126 .
the removed region corresponds to @xmath127 and @xmath128 , where the boundary @xmath129 is shrunk to a point in the @xmath123-@xmath70 plane .
note that the identification @xmath130 as a single point in the @xmath123-@xmath70 plane is not produced by the killing vector .
the region of interest , @xmath121 , excludes the original singularity where the static @xmath37-brane lays . in spite of this , in what follows we shall show that there is a singular behavior at @xmath56 due to the identification of this circle ( at fixed time ) with a point . if this identification had not been performed , the resulting spacetime would have been regular , but with a geometry similar to the one of the spinning btz black hole at @xmath56 ( see appendix b of ref.@xcite ) .
once the region with closed time - like curves has been removed , the metric can be recast into the adm form @xmath131 where the lapse and shift functions are @xmath132 note that , with this parameterization , the metric is well - defined in the limit @xmath133 , although the extremal case is obtained by a different identification in ads space @xcite . however , this is a peculiarity of the three - dimensional metric only .
even though the lagrangian governing the dynamics of this @xmath37-brane has not been introduced , the existence of a nontrivial angular momentum can be established by calculating the angular velocity , @xmath134 , at the circle @xmath135 , @xmath136    the geometry of this asymptotically locally ads spacetime is an analytic continuation of the @xmath137 black hole , where the parameters @xmath138 are continuations of the horizons @xmath139 . by comparison with the @xmath137 black hole , the real parameters @xmath66 and @xmath67 can be related to the mass , @xmath140 , and angular momentum , @xmath141 , of the btz solution as @xmath142 even without the knowledge of the lagrangian .
thus , the metric ( [ schwarzschild - like ] ) describes a btz - like @xmath37-brane with a negative mass parameter , @xmath143 , boosted with respect to the static brane as @xmath144 .
the parameter @xmath145 is related to the angular momentum , @xmath146 .
let us summarize what we have done so far .
an identification by a killing vector of the pseudosphere @xmath147 embedded in @xmath39 amounts to a single identification by @xmath148 in ads@xmath45 .
the resulting manifold @xmath149ads@xmath150 is described by the metric ( [ boosted metric ] ) .
since the identification is made by an isometry and is properly discontinuous , except at @xmath151 , @xmath152 has constant curvature for @xmath153 and thus there is no curvature singularity .
this manifold , however , contains closed time - like curves in the region @xmath122 ( @xmath154 ) .
therefore , in order to have a causally well defined spacetime , the region @xmath122 must be removed by cutting along the surface @xmath119 , defined by @xmath155 .
then all points that satisfy @xmath119 at fixed time are identified , producing a new manifold , @xmath156 , which has a naked singularity at @xmath119 .
another way of constructing the same geometry is the following .
take the ads@xmath38 spacetime ( [ ads metric ] ) and remove a portion of space @xmath122 ( for some arbitrary @xmath157 ) . then identify the points of the resulting space with ( [ covering identification ] ) , where now @xmath66 and @xmath67 satisfy the relation with @xmath157 given by ( [ 3d_kv ] ) . in this way , no closed time - like curves are produced since the region where they would appear was already cut out from space , and also there is no singularity .
now , the origin of the manifold is actually the circle @xmath119 ( @xmath56 ) for fixed time , so by identifying all those points which is _ not
_ done by a killing vector a curvature singularity appears now at the origin .
the question we want to analyze is what happens with the curvature at the point @xmath56 of @xmath156 after this last identification .
the position of the source responsible for the singularity in spacetime is determined by the surface where the norm of the killing vector vanishes . in the case at hand
, we thus expect a source with a dirac delta - like distribution of the form @xmath158 .
as shown below , this is indeed the case and there are no stronger singularities on the manifold , such as @xmath159 , or @xmath160 , etc .
in general , the singularity appears because the 1-form @xmath161 is not exact on the whole manifold @xmath156 .
namely , at @xmath56 , where @xmath70 is not defined , it is not true that @xmath162 .
thus , we shall assume that @xmath163 , where @xmath164 is some distribution that is zero when @xmath165 and infinite when @xmath56 .
the static @xmath37-brane , for example , has @xmath166 .    in order to identify the source and nature of the singularity
, one can construct the ads connection using the vielbein and the spin - connection for the metric ( [ boosted metric ] ) in the region of interest @xmath121 ( @xmath167 ) , @xmath168 d\phi    \nonumber \\ [ 0.5em ] & & + \frac{1}{\ell ^{2}}\,\left [ b\left ( a\mathbf{j}_{01}+b\mathbf{j}_{23}\right ) + \sqrt{b^{2}+\ell ^{2}}\left ( a\mathbf{j}_{03}-b\mathbf{j}_{12}\right ) \right ] dt \ , .
\label{a_ads}\end{aligned}\ ] ] the curvature for @xmath167 is @xmath169 \delta ( r)\,dr\wedge d\phi \ , .
\label{f}\ ] ] this form of @xmath23 vanishes everywhere , with the possible exception at @xmath56 .
it has been recently claimed that spinning branes require derivatives of the dirac delta function ( or @xmath159 ) @xcite .
those arguments rely on the condition of vanishing torsion everywhere but , as discussed below , this requirement is not met by the present solution . in fact , as can be observed from ( [ f ] ) , the torsional parts ( along @xmath170 and @xmath171 ) have the same singular behavior as the curvature parts ( along @xmath172 and @xmath173 ) .
thus , the configurations analyzed in refs.@xcite , not obtained by identifications , correspond to different solutions compared to the ones considered here .
let us assume a generic form for the singularity like @xmath174 , where @xmath175 is a power series in @xmath176 with coefficients depending on @xmath66 and @xmath67 . then , requiring that the static @xmath37-brane is recovered in the limit @xmath177 implies that @xmath175 can be , at most , a linear combination of @xmath178 and @xmath159 . finally , expanding the expressions in ( [ f ] ) as a series around @xmath56 leads to the source @xmath179 where @xmath180 \,\delta(r)\,dr\wedge d\phi \ , .
\label{j(c)}\ ] ] clearly , this form of the source reproduces the static limit , but not the extremal one . the distribution @xmath164 can be calculated directly using the definition of the riemann curvature , _
i.e. _ , by parallel transport of a lorentz vector @xmath181 along an infinitesimal contour around the point @xmath56 . in this way ,
the riemann curvature part of the source can be evaluated ( see appendix [ transport ] ) , with the result @xmath182 the torsional part of the source ( along the generators @xmath183 ) can not be obtained by the same parallel transport . however , comparing ( [ j_r ] ) with ( [ j(c ) ] ) , the @xmath184 terms match only if the distribution is identified as @xmath185 .
the remaining components , along the generators @xmath183 , correspond to the torsional part of source , @xmath186 it is then plain to see that the source carries no singularities stronger than @xmath187 .    the above method to calculate @xmath20 is not easily generalized to higher dimensions because it calculates directly only the riemann curvature and the number of differential equations that need to be solved grows with the dimension .
the most precise way to determine the source is to use the fact that @xmath23 is locally ` pure gauge ' , so the ads connection has the form @xmath188 where @xmath189 is a group element of ads . by solving this equation in @xmath189 with the ads connection given by ( [ a_ads ] ) , we obtain @xmath190 where @xmath191 , @xmath192 , we denote @xmath193 and @xmath194 is a constant element of the ads group .
a non - trivial holonomy appears because @xmath189 is not single - valued .
indeed , the holonomy @xmath195 is generated by the killing vector ( [ nonextreml killing ] ) as @xmath196 , up to a conjugation by a constant group element @xmath194 .
the result does not depend on the coordinates @xmath197 and @xmath198 .    in order to calculate the curvature
, one can look at the quantity @xmath199 , where @xmath200 is a small circle of radius @xmath201 around the causal horizon at constant @xmath198 .
we obtain @xmath202 & = & -\frac{2\pi a}{\ell } \,\left ( a_*\,\mathbf{j}_{12}-b_*\,\mathbf{j}_{23}\right ) \,+\frac{2\pi b}{\ell } \,\left ( b_*\,\mathbf{j}_{01}+a_*\,\mathbf{j}_{03}\right ) \
, , \label{au(1)}\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath203 .
on the other hand , if @xmath204 is a surface whose boundary is @xmath200 , in a similar fashion it can be shown that @xmath205 , so that @xmath206 note that a nontrivial result in the ads curvature comes from @xmath207 .
thus , due to the holonomy centered at @xmath155 , or @xmath119 ( @xmath56 ) in the @xmath208-plane , we have @xmath209 then , from ( [ f ] ) , @xmath185 , and from @xmath179 the source reads @xmath210 \,\delta ( r)\,dr\wedge \frac{d\phi}{2\pi } \ , ,   \label{j_holonomy}\ ] ] in perfect agreement with the result obtained before by other method .
when @xmath118 , this current produces the static brane , @xmath211 . also , when @xmath212 , the source simply vanishes .
( vanishing @xmath66 and @xmath67 are physically equivalent to @xmath69 in our choice of the range of these parameters . )    in the next subsection , we show that three - dimensional spinning @xmath37-branes can be stable .
locally ads @xmath37-branes can be constructed in any gravity theory with negative cosmological constant where global ads is an exact solution . in order to study their stability , one needs to know about the dynamics of the theory , and analyze fluctuations around the solution .
we thus need to provide a bulk lagrangian , which we shall take to be cs ads supergravity .
this is a gauge theory whose supergroup is @xmath213 @xmath214 @xmath215 , and it contains @xmath216 supersymmetries .
apart from the vielbein and spin - connection , the super ads connection contains additional bosonic components , that we call the bosonic cs matter .    in ref.@xcite
, it was shown that a static @xmath37-brane without bosonic cs matter is possibly unstable since it breaks all supersymmetries .
inclusion of @xmath4 matter can stabilize the brane and turn it into a bps state by preserving some supersymmetries in an extremal , charged , static case . here
we show that an extremal spinning @xmath37-brane can be a bps state even without bosonic matter , as first found in ref.@xcite in the special case of @xmath217 .
in general , the number of preserved supersymmetries is determined by the number of killing spinors @xmath218 , each component ` @xmath219 ' or 
@xmath220 transforming as a vector in one copy of @xmath221 labeled by the indices @xmath222 .    to find these spinors , we will make use of the static case analyzed in detail in ref.@xcite , because both cases ( spinning and static ) have locally the same form .
thus , in the background of an uncharged 0-brane and with a suitable representation of the generators , the killing spinor equation for each copy of @xmath221 has the form @xmath223 \epsilon _ { i}^{\pm } = 0 \,,\ ] ] where @xmath224 are three - dimensional matrices satisfying the clifford algebra ( we consider only one of the two inequivalent representations of @xmath225-matrices , @xmath226 @xcite ) .
the vielbein and spin - connection are given in eq.([a_ads ] ) .
then , a general solution for the killing spinor is @xcite @xmath227 where @xmath228 is a constant spinor fulfilling the chirality projection @xmath229 this killing spinor is also _ globally _ well - defined if it satisfies periodic or anti - periodic boundary conditions for @xmath230 , _
i.e. _ , @xmath231 and @xmath232 . in consequence , @xmath233 implies the extremality condition @xmath234 when @xmath118 ( static case ) , the only possibility to have this condition satisfied is for global ads ( @xmath235 ) .
for the spinning 0-brane , @xmath236 , the bps configuration can exist even without additional bosonic matter , because the angular momentum plays the role of a @xmath4 field .
this is an accident of three dimensions only , where the metric admits the limit @xmath237 , even though the brane constructions for @xmath238 and @xmath81 differ @xcite .
these bps states preserve @xmath239 supersymmetries ; a half is projected out by the condition ( [ projection ] ) .
the result can be generalized to include charged 0-branes , as well .
the construction of @xmath3-branes by killing vector identifications outlined above can be extended to higher dimensions by a procedure analogous to the static case @xcite . here
we present an explicit form of that construction in @xmath240 dimensions .
the idea is to introduce naked singularities by making identifications with rotational killing vectors in the four - dimensional spatial section of ads in embedding space .
the rotation generator @xmath241 , that leaves invariant the @xmath242-@xmath243-plane , generates a conical singularity at the center , @xmath244 . clearly , there are at most two independent identifications that can be performed simultaneously , generated by two commuting rotation generators in the four - dimensional spatial section , @xmath241 and @xmath245 , with @xmath246 a permutation of @xmath247
.    the resulting branes can also carry angular momentum , which would be the case if the identification is not restricted to be along the spatial section of ads space , but is given by a generic element of the ads@xmath248 group ( @xmath249 ) , corresponding to a boost on two planes simultaneously .
more precisely , the ads@xmath248 algebra has three commuting generators ( @xmath173 , @xmath250 and @xmath251 , say ) which allow for the introduction of three independent parameters in a locally ads brane solution : the mass @xmath140 , and two angular momenta @xmath252 and @xmath253 .
we will consider a codimension - two brane in a locally ads spacetime , obtained by an identification with a killing vector in global ads@xmath254 .
this brane is by definition the locus of points where the norm of the killing vector field vanishes .
the ads@xmath254 spacetime can be viewed as the pseudo sphere @xmath255 embedded in @xmath256 , with metric @xmath257 diag@xmath258 .
a coordinate chart that describes this surface is given by @xmath259 x^{5}=a\cosh \tau \sin \phi _ { 05}\ , , & x^{2}=b\sin \phi _ { 12}\ , , & x^{4}=a\sinh \tau \sin \phi _ { 34 } \ , , \end{array } \label{general embedding}\ ] ] where @xmath260 and @xmath261 .
these coordinates are chosen so that the @xmath262-brane is obtained by an identification in global ads@xmath254 along the azimuthal angles @xmath49 , @xmath263 and @xmath264 . then @xmath197 becomes the radial coordinate outside the brane and @xmath265 is the radial coordinate in the worldvolume of the brane . the azimuthal angles @xmath49 , @xmath263 and @xmath264 might have angular deficits in general , as the identifications are performed in the euclidean planes @xmath266-@xmath267 , @xmath268-@xmath269 and @xmath270-@xmath271 , respectively .    in the coordinates ( [ general embedding ] ) ,
the metric takes the form @xmath272 this metric corresponds to the covering of ads@xmath248 provided @xmath273 ( the unwrapped time coordinate ) and @xmath274 $ ] are periodic .
rescalings of these last two angles introduce angular deficits that characterize a particular identification .
the most general identification , producing both linear defects and angular momenta in two planes , can be obtained by a general linear transformation between the embedding angles @xmath275 and some new coordinates in ads@xmath248 .
the new coordinates @xmath276 , defined for @xmath277 and @xmath70 , @xmath278 $ ] , are related to the original embedding coordinates by an invertible matrix @xmath279 , @xmath280 the identifications @xmath281 and @xmath282 are responsible for introducing angular defects . in the new coordinates , the metric ( [ two spins ] ) can be cast in the familiar adm form , @xmath283 where @xmath284 are two independent azimuthal angles .
the lapse @xmath285 and shift functions @xmath286 , as well as the two - dimensional metric @xmath287 , read @xmath288 + \gamma_{mn}\ , n^m n^n\ , , \\ [ 0.5em ] n^m & = & \frac{1}{\ell}\ , \gamma^{mn } \left [ u_{2}a_{n}b^{2}+a^{2}\left ( -u_{1}b_{n}\cosh ^{2}\tau + u_{3}c_{n}\sinh ^{2}\tau \right ) \right]\ , , \\ [ 0.5em ] \gamma_{mn } &
= & a_ma_nb^2 + a^2(-b_mb_n\cosh ^{2}\tau+c_mc_n\sinh ^{2}\tau)\,.\end{aligned}\ ] ] the off - diagonal components @xmath289 and @xmath290 are related to two possible nontrivial angular velocities of this spacetime . the components @xmath291 , @xmath292 and @xmath293 are functions of the spacetime coordinates that might change signs and lead to a non - causal global structure , with regions containing closed time - like curves . in that case , those non - causal regions must be removed from the manifold , potentially generating singularities analogous to the central singularity in the @xmath137 black hole .
@xmath294 are angular velocities of the points at @xmath295 .
thus , the shift functions @xmath296 contain information about the non - vanishing angular momenta of these stationary , locally ads brane geometries .    in this general setting , the action of the system has not been specified .
thus , the mass and angular momenta can not be determined , as they are conserved charges defined by the lagrangian via noether s theorem .
furthermore , in order to obtain finite charges , boundary terms ( and counterterms ) must be added to the bulk action , that has been done in five - dimensional cs ads gravity without torsion in @xcite , with torsion in @xcite and in higher - dimensional lovelock ads gravities in ref.@xcite .
for some branes one can compare the asymptotic behavior of the metric with that of solutions in asymptotically ads spaces with known mass and angular momenta in some standard theory .
if the metrics match , the mass and angular momenta of the brane may be identified with those of the known solution .
on the other hand , unlike the angular momenta , the angular velocities @xmath297 of the brane are kinematically determined by the geometry itself .
the periodicity of the coordinate @xmath70 in ads space implies certain identifications of points in the embedding space , @xmath298 & \phi _ { 12}\simeq \phi _ { 12}+2\pi a_{1}\ , , \\ [ 0.3em ] & \phi _ { 34}\simeq \phi _ { 34}+2\pi c_{1}\ , , \end{array}\ ] ] and similarly for @xmath299 , @xmath300 & \phi _ { 12}\simeq \phi _
{ 12}+2\pi a_{2}\ , , \\ [ 0.3em ] & \phi

the matrices @xmath309 are antisymmetric , block - diagonal , and have eigenvalues @xmath310 , @xmath311 and @xmath312 .
the knowledge of three eigenvalues for each matrix is equivalent to knowing three casimir invariants : quadratic ( @xmath313 ) , cubic ( @xmath314 ) and the quartic one ( @xmath315 ) or , in the case at hand , @xmath316 , @xmath317 and @xmath318 , respectively .
the set of parameters is equivalent to the set of casimir invariants , where only three are independent .
these parameters are , therefore , gauge - invariant quantities related to the conserved charges @xmath140 , @xmath319 and @xmath320 , where the explicit relations depend on the gravity action .    in order to provide a geometric interpretation for this general framework , we consider codimension - two branes that possess a static limit .
these spinning branes can be obtained from the static ones by a lorentz boost in a plane formed by the time coordinate and an azymuthal angle @xcite . in five dimensions ,
there are two such angles , here called @xmath70 and @xmath299 , so it is possible to do two idependent boosts , introducing two independent angular velocities .
let us denote the coordinates of a static @xmath262-brane by @xmath321 . in ref.@xcite
, it was shown that a static 2-brane can be produced by an angular deficit @xmath322 in the @xmath266-@xmath267 plane through a rescaling of the angle @xmath70 and the time coordinate . in this case , the embedding angles read @xmath323 where @xmath324diag@xmath325 .
the static metric has the form @xmath326 the resulting geometry has a conical ( dirac delta ) curvature singularity in the @xmath327-plane @xcite .
the coefficient @xmath99 is related to the mass of the brane , although the precise relation depends on the particular gravitational action that is assumed .
the described 2-branes are locally ads , so that the curvature vanishes locally , @xmath15 , which means constant negative riemann curvature and vanishing torsion ( _ cf .
( [ ads_curvatrure ] ) ) .
thus , the ads connection is  locally pure gauge ' and can be expressed in terms of an element of the ads group @xmath189 as @xmath328 . in order to calculate @xmath189 for the metric ( [ two spins ] ) , the vielbein can be chosen as @xmath329 since the torsion vanishes , the spin - connection can be algebraically obtained , and the ads connection ( [ ads_connection ] ) has the form @xmath330 & & + \frac{1}{\ell}\left ( a\cosh \tau\ , \mathbf{j}_{05}+b\cosh \tau\ , \mathbf{j}_{01 } + \ell \sinh \tau\ , \mathbf{j}_{03}\right ) d\phi _ { 05 }   \notag \\ [ 0.5em ] & & + \frac{1}{\ell}\left(a\sinh \tau\ , \mathbf{j}_{45}-b\sinh \tau\ , \mathbf{j}_{14}-\ell \cosh \tau\ , \mathbf{j}_{34}\right ) d\phi _ { 34}\ , .

the group element @xmath189 is not globally defined since @xmath336 , which is precisely what gives rise the brane geometry . with the explicit form of @xmath189
, we can calculate the corresponding sources .
so far we have assumed a generic form for the identification matrix @xmath279 . in the next subsections we study particular cases corresponding to interesting brane configurations .
as discussed in the three - dimensional case , the spinning solution can be obtained by  boosting ' the static geometry , and this can also be done in five dimensions .
we will first boost the static 2-brane ( [ 5d static ] ) in the ( transverse ) @xmath70 direction , by performing a lorentz transformation @xmath337 on the @xmath338-plane , with velocity @xmath339 , @xmath340 represented by the matrix @xmath341 where @xmath342 .
the extreme case ( @xmath343 ) is not included in this analysis .
the angles in the embedding space are related to the ads coordinates via the matrix @xmath344 , so that @xmath345 where the constants @xmath346 satisfy @xmath347 from @xmath230 , the above boost can be seen to be equivalent to the identification @xmath348 produced by the killing vector @xmath349 the norm of this vector is @xmath350 and it is non - negative only if @xmath351 where @xmath352 the physical region corresponds to that where the norm of @xmath353 is positive , which requires @xmath354 . note that @xmath355 and hence this region does not contain the point @xmath151 .
the domain of the coordinates @xmath197 and @xmath265 , @xmath356 , for which the spacetime is physical , is shown in figure [ 5dbrane - phi ] .
the horizon @xmath357 can be identified with the origin of the radial direction , a point that shall be called @xmath56 , by introducing a new radial coordinate @xmath358 .    .
the physical region is the shaded area @xmath359.,scaledwidth=52.0% ]    the explicit form of the metric for this solution in the adm form ( [ adm angles ] ) is @xmath360 where the lapse and shift functions are @xmath361 and we denoted @xmath362 .
the sources can be identified from the flux they produce . since the curvature is given by the current ( cf .
eq ( [ f = j ] ) ) , the flux can be computed integrating the connection around the singular points .
thus , starting from the ads group element  ( [ g general ] ) for the angles ( [ j1 mixing ] ) , the source is obtained from @xmath363 . here ,
the only non - vanishing contour integrals are @xmath364 on infinitesimal loops around the killing vector horizon @xmath365 , given by @xmath366 , @xmath367thus , since the angles @xmath49 and @xmath263 define @xmath266-@xmath267 and @xmath270-@xmath271 planes in the embedding space , respectively , the source can be written as @xmath368 where the dirac delta 2-forms are @xmath369 and should be thought of as projected in ads@xmath248 .
therefore , both deltas are proportional to @xmath370 , up to the corresponding jacobians .
the source describes one codimension - two brane generated by one killing vector identification .
the angular momentum is associated to the azimuthal angle @xmath100 outside the brane .
next , we construct a brane with angular momentum associated to the interior azimuthal angle @xmath299 , obtained by boosting this interior angle in the static brane .      the static 2-brane ( [ 5d static ] ) can be boosted in the @xmath299 direction by a lorentz transformation @xmath371 in the @xmath372-@xmath373 plane , with velocity @xmath374 , @xmath375 restricted to the space of the coordinates @xmath376 , this transformation has the form @xmath377 where the velocity is related to the hyperbolic angle , or rapidity , as @xmath109 .
the spinning geometry can be obtained by applying a lorentz transformation to the corresponding coordinates of the static brane , @xmath378 .
the boosted geometry is the same as ( [ two spins ] ) after ( [ phiidentification ] ) and ( [ thetaidentification ] ) , obtained by taking the quotient of the five - dimensional pseudosphere by a killing vector .
the relation between the two results can be made explicit by combining the two steps , ( [ static angles ] ) and ( [ boost - v ] ) , into a single transformation that expresses the embedding angles in terms of the coordinates of the spinning brane , where @xmath279 in ( [ mix matrix ] ) is calculated from @xmath379 the nonvanishing parameters that define angular deficits are @xmath380 there are only two independent parameters , because @xmath381 satisfy @xmath382 the velocity parameter is related to the angular deficits as @xmath383 with @xmath384 ( non - extremal brane ) , or @xmath385 .
the non - extremality condition does not mean that extremal branes do not exist .
it only means that they should be constructed from a different killing vector identification , not continuously connected to the boost ( [ boost - v ] ) .
the periodicity in the angular coordinates of the brane geometry is related to the magnitude of the identifications in the embedding space , @xmath386 and @xmath387 & \phi _ { 34}\simeq \phi _ { 34}+2\pi c_{2}\ , .

\label{two kv}\end{aligned}\ ] ] the identification by @xmath353 produces a static 2-brane in the @xmath266-@xmath267-plane @xcite , and @xmath389 boosts it in the perpendicular direction producing a spinning 2-brane if @xmath390 ( see section [ threed branes ] ) .
the corresponding norms are @xmath391 \left\vert \xi_2 \right\vert ^2 & = & 4\pi^2 a^2 \left ( -b_2 ^ 2\cosh^2\!\tau + c_2 ^ 2\sinh^2\!\tau \right ) \,.\end{aligned}\ ] ] the manifold formed after the identifications does not contain closed time - like curves only if both @xmath353 and @xmath389 have positive norms . while @xmath392 is always nonnegative , @xmath393 is nonnegative only if @xmath394 , and @xmath395 the resulting spacetime requires to cut off the region @xmath396 .      in the spacetime with more than one killing vector identification , we call the causal horizon a unique surface that separates the outer region , where _ all _ @xmath397 are strictly positive , from the interior region , where at least one of these norms is negative . following the procedure established in previous sections
, the interior must be removed from the manifold in order to avoid violations of causality produced by closed time - like curves .
this surface should not be confused with an event horizon which can be crossed by a geodesic .
the causal horizon becomes a boundary generated by the identification , where the spacetime ceases to be a smooth manifold once all points in this surface are identified and the surface shrinks the singular locus , @xmath398 , where the brane sits .
this transformation does not change the curvature of spacetime in the outer region , but it produces an infinite curvature at the horizon , that therefore becomes a brane source , @xmath24 @xcite .    in terms of the new coordinates , the metric ( [ two spins ] )
reads @xmath399 \,dt^2   \notag \\ & & \!\!\!+a^2 \left [ \rule{0pt}{14pt}\left(c_2 ^ 2 -b_2 ^ 2\right ) \cosh^2 \tau -c_2 ^ 2\right ] d\theta ^2+\frac{2b_2 c_2}{\ell a_0 } \ , a^2 \left [ \rule{0pt}{14pt}\left ( 1-a_0 ^ 2 \right ) \cosh^2\!\tau -1\right ] dt \,d\theta \ , .
\label{j2 metric}\end{aligned}\ ] ] we shall argue now that this metric does not describe one codimension - two brane , but two intersecting codimension - two branes .    the first two terms in the metric ( [ j2 metric ] ) describe a conical defect in the center of the @xmath208-plane due to the angular deficit @xmath400 .
thus , let us first analyze the center by setting @xmath151 .
this surface is a 2-brane , @xmath401 \,\frac{dt^2}{a_0 ^ 2 } + \ell^2d\tau^2   \notag \\ & & + \ell^2 \left ( \rule{0pt}{14pt}a_0 ^ 2 \cosh^2\!\tau -c_2 ^ 2\right ) d\theta^2+\frac{2b_2 c_2\ell}{a_0}\,\left [ \rule{0pt}{14pt}\left(1-a_0 ^ 2\right ) \cosh^2 \tau -1\right ] dt\,d\theta \,.\end{aligned}\ ] ] introducing a new radial coordinate , @xmath402 , that identifies the surface @xmath403 with @xmath404 , and also rescaling the time coordinate , as @xmath405 leaves the metric in the adm form , @xmath406 where @xmath407 & & \tilde{n}^{\theta } ( \rho ) = \frac{b_2 c_2}{\ell a_0 ^ 2}\,\left(1- a_0 ^ 2\right ) - \frac{b_2 c_2\ell}{\rho^2}\ , .
\label{shift1}\end{aligned}\ ] ] comparing with eqs.([schwarzschild - like ] ) and ( [ lapse - shift ] ) , the worldvolume geometry ( [ 3d-0brane ] ) describes the three - dimensional spacetime produced by a spinning 0-brane in anti - de sitter .
this is the solution , for example , of einstein s equations in three dimensions with negative cosmological constant in the presence of a spinning topological defect .
the mass of the brane is @xmath408 and @xmath409 is the angular momentum , and thus the familiar inequality @xmath410 follows trivially .    in general , for arbitrary @xmath197 , the full five - dimensional
metric describes a warped product of a conical defect and a spinning brane , @xmath411 thus , using the coordinates @xmath412 and @xmath413 defined above , and introducing @xmath53 , the metric reads @xmath414 \ , , \label{interbrane}\ ] ] where @xmath415 note that the lapse and shift functions defined in eq.([adm angles ] ) , here correspond to @xmath416 and @xmath417 , written in the coordinates @xmath418 that cover only the outer region with respect to the causal horizon .
it is apparent now that the surface @xmath56 is a three - dimensional submanifold with the geometry produced by a spinning 0-brane . on the other hand
, the surface @xmath419 ( where @xmath299 is not defined ) , has the geometry of a static 2-brane .
the resulting warped geometry ( [ interbrane ] ) is such that the singularities representing the worldvolumes of the branes are , in turn , the 3d spacetime geometries produced by a static ( @xmath419 ) and a spinning ( @xmath56 ) 0-branes , respectively .
this suggests that this configuration might survive the addition of a further interaction corresponding to codimension - four objects localized in the worldvolume of both 2-branes .
we will explore this possibility elsewhere .
we expect that the form of the sources keeps this geometrical picture of two intersecting 2-branes .
following the steps of section 3.2.1 to identify the source , let us consider a generic lie group element ( [ g general ] ) in the coordinates ( [ j2 mixing ] ) , @xmath420 where @xmath421 is some constant group element .
similarly to the three - dimensional case , the curvature singularity can be calculated evaluating the loop integral of @xmath422 along an infinitesimal contour around the killing vector horizons . in this case , the source is identified as @xmath423 & & + \frac{2\pi c_2}{\ell } \left(a\sinh\tau\ , \mathbf{j}_{45}-b\sinh\tau \,\mathbf{j}_{14}-\ell \cosh\tau\ , \mathbf{j}_{34}\right ) \delta(\sigma_{34 } ) \ , .
\label{j_intersect}\end{aligned}\ ] ] since @xmath20 is a sum of various currents whose dirac deltas are supported on ( at most two ) different submanifolds of the four - dimensional spatial section , it means that we are dealing with ( at most two ) different independent 2-branes . indeed , the first term in the source corresponds to a static 2-brane , @xmath424 expressing @xmath425 and @xmath426 in terms of @xmath427 , using the relation for @xmath428 given by eq.([tau , t ] ) and finally evaluating the current by means of the identity @xmath429 , it can be shown that the source for the 3d spinning brane is , @xmath430   \delta ( \rho)\,d\rho \wedge \frac{d\theta}{2\pi } \,.\ ] ] this can be confirmed by direct comparison with eq.([j_holonomy ] ) .
we conclude that an intersection of two 2-branes is a 0-brane ( that is , a worldline parameterized by the time @xmath412 ) with nonvanishing angular momentum . in general , when @xmath431 , these two branes combine the sources in a more complicated way , as in eq.([j_intersect ] ) .
we shall see below that intersecting codimension - two branes _ generically _ appear when the angular momentum of the solution is transversal to the original static brane .      in order to boost the static 2-brane in a most general way in five dimensions , we introduce two lorentz transformations with velocities @xmath342 and @xmath109 ( @xmath432,@xmath433 ) , @xmath434 represented by matrices ( [ lambda1 ] ) and ( [ lambda2 ] ) , where @xmath435 = \mathbf{l}_{24}$ ] .
after that double boosting , the mixing of angles given by @xmath436 takes the form @xmath437    from @xmath230 and @xmath438 , we get that angular momenta are produced by two independent identifications , @xmath439 and @xmath440 respectively , where the constants are @xmath441 there are only three independent parameters , because six constants are subjected to three constraints , @xmath442    the identifications ( [ identifications1 ] ) and ( [ identifications2 ] ) are produced by two independent killing vector fields @xmath443 whose norms read @xmath444 the vector @xmath353 is the same one that brings into existence a 2-brane with the angular momentum @xmath319 , and we know that its norm is positive when eqs .
( [ xi_1>0 ] ) and ( [ b_h ] ) are satisfied , that is , @xmath445 where @xmath446 on the other hand , sectors with @xmath447 exist only if @xmath394 .
then @xmath389 is a space - like vector in the region @xmath448 where we have introduced the points @xmath449    when @xmath450 , the vector @xmath389 is space - like for any @xmath197 , but this 2-brane possesses one angular momentum only , since @xmath451 . if @xmath452 , the vector @xmath389 is not space - like in any region of the manifold .
regions where a 2-brane is defined for various angular momenta , are shown in figure [ 5dbrane - two ] .     and @xmath453.,title='fig:',scaledwidth=43.0% ]   and @xmath453.,title='fig:',scaledwidth=43.0% ]    finally , if @xmath454 , @xmath455 , a well - defined spacetime corresponds to a region where both @xmath456 and @xmath457 are space - like vectors , when the horizons ( with vanishing @xmath458 and @xmath459 ) are identified with a point .
in this procedure , all the sectors where a norm of at least one of the vectors is negative , have been removed .
what remains is non empty if the curves @xmath460 and @xmath461 intersect , that is , if @xmath394 and @xmath462 .
the intersection point @xmath463 is a solution of @xmath464 .
the causal horizon @xmath465 is the boundary of the region where both killing vectors are space - like , so that it coincides in parts with the curves @xmath460 and @xmath461 . in terms of the parameters , a condition to have a 2-brane is @xmath466    as mentioned above , when the intersection exists , the causal horizon @xmath467 is the union of two surfaces defined by @xmath468 and @xmath469 .
the radial coordinate outside the brane is defined for @xmath470 , and the radial coordinate @xmath265 inside the brane becomes compact , @xmath471 .    removing the interior region ( @xmath472 ) produces a globally nontrivial identification . unlike identifications generated by the action of a killing vector , this one _ does _ change the curvature , but only at the horizon , whereas for @xmath473 ( outside the horizon ) the equation @xmath15 holds , and the spacetime is locally ads . on the other hand ,
the horizon @xmath474 becomes a point after the identifications , and the curvature there is infinite .
the surfaces @xmath475 and @xmath476 are not joined smoothly at the point @xmath463 because , as in section [ intersection ] , this point is an intersection of two 2-branes , produced by two distinct killing vector identifications .
this can be best seen directly from the source . when the conditions ( [ existence ] ) are fulfilled and the branes exist , the curvature singularity is calculated from @xmath477 \oint d\phi _ { 05 }   \notag \\ & & + \frac{1}{\ell } \,\left [ \sinh \tau \left ( a_*\mathbf{j}_{45}-b_*\mathbf{j}_{14}\right ) -\ell \cosh \tau \ , \mathbf{j}_{34}\right ] \oint d\phi _ { 34}\,.\end{aligned}\ ] ] the integral
is taken around an infinitesimal path close to the horizon @xmath478 .
note that this path is not smooth , since it is composed by two curves .
non - vanishing integrals are due to the presence of sources , and the total current is a sum of various sources defined on different planes .
again , these sources are expressed in terms of only two independent dirac deltas  the ones on the @xmath197-@xmath70 and @xmath265-@xmath299 planes , generated by two independent killing vector identifications .
this is guaranteed by construction because the sources appear only at the causal horizons @xmath479 .    because @xmath480 , the angular section @xmath287 in the adm metric ( [ adm angles ] ) is not diagonal , the @xmath197-@xmath70 and @xmath265-@xmath299 planes are not orthogonal to each other .
thus , the coordinates used here are natural to perform the identifications , but they are not the best adapted for writing the sources for each brane as an independent term . a convenient method to deal with this is the one used in ref.@xcite for locally flat configurations , where the metric is put in the canonical form that separates ( up to warp factors ) submanifolds with different killing vector symmetries .
this calculation is technically cumbersome because the coordinate transformation depends also on @xmath197 and @xmath265 , and is beyond the scope of this paper .
since lorentz transformations do not commute , one last question to clarify is what happens if the order of the boosts applied to a static brane is reversed .
taking @xmath481 , an inequivalent mixing of the angles is obtained , so that the parameters for the angular deficits now become @xmath482 the constraints between the parameters are @xmath483    the norms of killing vectors that produce identification read @xmath484 the vector field @xmath389 is space - like for @xmath485 , where @xmath486 exists if @xmath487 , otherwise @xmath389 is never space - like , in which case the spacetime would have ill - defined causal structure , making those brane solutions unphysical . on the other hand ,
if @xmath488 , the norm of the @xmath353 can be written as @xmath489 \,,\ ] ] where @xmath490 and @xmath491
. then , the regions with nonegative @xmath392 are shown in figure [ 5dbrane - two - bis ] , and they are bounded by the horizon @xmath492 .     with respect to the pair defined by @xmath453 and @xmath493 ( whenever they adopt real values).,title='fig:',scaledwidth=43.0% ]   with respect to the pair defined by @xmath453 and @xmath493 ( whenever they adopt real values).,title='fig:',scaledwidth=43.0% ]   with respect to the pair defined by @xmath453 and @xmath493 ( whenever they adopt real values).,title='fig:',scaledwidth=43.0% ]    a nonempty intersection of two regions ( where both @xmath353 and @xmath389 are spacelike ) is what remains after all other sectors are cut out from the manifold .
this truncation produces the sources , that geometrically describe two intersecting branes .
compared to the two 2-branes of subsection [ 5dbrane_two j ] obtained by different boosting of the static brane , the configurations constructed here contain branes with noncompact internal spacetimes ( @xmath197 and @xmath265 unbounded ) , as shown in the first two graphs of figure [ 5dbrane - two - bis ] .
note that for a 2-brane whose angular momenta are defined by the boost @xmath494 , the @xmath279 matrix can be written as @xmath495 where the parameters are obtained using the baker - campbell - hausdorff formula as @xmath496 , @xmath497 and @xmath498 .
thus , in general , a 2-brane with the required features can be  designed ' by appropriately choosing the parameters @xmath499 , @xmath500 and @xmath501 . in order to ensure that @xmath279 corresponds to a boost and not a rotation between the coordinates @xmath70 and @xmath299
, the generator should have real eigenvalues .
the eigenvalues of @xmath279 squared are @xmath502 which can are , in turn , related to the angular deficits in @xmath70 and @xmath299 by @xmath503 \

this requires a previous knowledge of the lagrangian that we have not specified so far .
we will study stability in the context of cs ads supergravity for the super group @xmath505 , which is the natural supersymmetric extension of the five - dimensional ads group .
this supergravity has @xmath285 supersymmetries and the spinors @xmath506 ( @xmath507 ) transform as @xmath508 vectors .
a @xmath504-brane is stable if it preserves some supersymmetries described by local spinorial parameters @xmath509 .
these killing spinors are solutions of @xmath510 in the background given by the ads connection ( [ ads connection ] ) .
hence , stability will be expected to hold for those configurations that admit globally defined solutions of ( [ k - spinor - eq ] ) . for simplicity
, we will assume that all other components of @xmath511 in the superalgebra vanish .
the ads generators @xmath241 are represented in terms the five - dimensional gamma matrices , @xmath512 , as @xmath513 $ ] and @xmath514 .    solutions to this equation have been discussed in detail for static 2-branes in ref.@xcite . here , we make use of the fact that a solution for spinning 2-branes has the same local form as the static solution , where only global ( boundary ) conditions are changed .
thus , we write a general solution for the killing spinor as @xmath515 where @xmath193 , and a constant common eigen - spinor @xmath516 of the commuting matrices satisfies @xmath517 only the last two conditions are independent because @xmath518 . there are , thus , a priori @xmath519 independent spinors @xmath520 .
the existence of nontrivial solutions for ( [ k - spinor - eq ] ) depends on the boundary conditions of @xmath521 .
the periodicity of coordinates @xmath522 are determined by the mapping ( [ mix matrix ] ) between these angles and the embedding angles .
( anti)periodic conditions @xmath523 and @xmath524 imply @xmath525 this establishes the bps condition that relates the parameters @xmath526 and @xmath527 , which are the same for all branes with equal angular deficits , regardless of the boosts by which they are spun . in general , these are not the same as the extremality conditions that match the mass and angular momentum parameters for the extremal branes that correspond to the boosted static brane with maximal velocity . only in three dimensions
these conditions coincide .
clearly , in the absence of angular deficits ( @xmath528 ) there exists one stable solution , namely , global ads . for a static 2-brane ,
there is only one nontrivial parameter , which is not an integer .
hence the extremality conditions ( [ double extremal ] ) can not be fulfilled the
static 2-brane without bosonic cs matter is not stable @xcite .
if there is a nonvaninshing angular momentum , then two or more parameters are not integers , and the extremality conditions ( [ double extremal ] ) could in principle be satisfied by a one - parameter family of configurations . however , fulfilment of this condition is not guaranteed in general and must be checked for each particular system of 2-branes .
we , therefore , turn to particular cases .    for intersecting 2-branes with one angular momentum @xmath320 ,
the independent nontrivial parameters are @xmath529 and @xmath530 , given by eq.([b2c2 ] ) , and there is a unique extremality condition @xmath531 this condition clearly constraints only one parameter while leaving the others arbitrary , and is consistent with ( [ detu ] ) , so these stable bps branes exist
.    similarly , for a massive 2-brane with angular momentum @xmath319 , two independent parameters are @xmath532 and @xmath533 , and a stable bps 2-brane is obtained when @xmath534    more generally , for intersecting 2-branes with two angular momenta @xmath319 and @xmath320 , whose angular deficits have the form ( [ constants ] ) , the extremality condition reads @xmath535 a solution to these equations always exist , and the extremal 2-brane labeled by @xmath536 is parameterized by @xmath537 as @xmath538    other stable , spinning bps branes can also be obtained when the bosonic cs matter is included , as discussed in ref.@xcite .
configurations similar to the 2-branes discussed in ads@xmath248 can be generalized to higher - dimensional ads@xmath539 spacetime to obtain @xmath3-branes .
the idea is to introduce suitable identifications in the euclidean planes , after embedding the ads@xmath539 hypersphere , @xmath540 , in the flat space @xmath541 with cartesian coordinates @xmath542 ( @xmath543 ) and signature @xmath544 .
a convenient way to obtain a codimension - two brane in higher odd dimensions is to choose the coordinates @xmath545 , @xmath546 , @xmath547 and @xmath548 to represent a three - dimensional @xmath37-brane ( see section [ threed branes ] ) , parameterized by @xmath549 , the azimuthal angle @xmath49 , and the time coordinate @xmath550 , thickened by the introduction of @xmath504 internal radial coordinates , @xmath551 , and angles @xmath552 , so that @xcite @xmath553 x^{2p+3 } = a \upsilon_{1,p } \sin \phi _ { 0,2p+3}\ , , \qquad & x^{2}=b\sin \phi _ { 12}\ , , \end{array } \label{012d}\ ] ] and for @xmath554 , @xmath555 x^{2i+2 } & = & a \upsilon_{1,i-1 } \sinh\tau_{i } \sin \phi_{2i+1,2i+2}\ , .
\label{pairs}\end{aligned}\ ] ] here @xmath556 and we introduced , for compactness , the functions @xmath557 where @xmath558 .
we restrict to odd dimensions , but similar transformation exist in even dimensions , as well .    as a result of this construction that preserves the ads constraint ,
one obtains a spacetime with locally constant curvature that describes a 2@xmath504-brane .
the metric takes the form @xmath559 in five dimensions ( @xmath560 ) , this metric matches the one given by eq.([two spins ] ) , with @xmath561 .
because some azimuthal angles have deficits with respect to global ads , conical singularities are generated in the submanifolds that coincide with worldvolumes of static branes , and also causal horizons are generated when the branes are rotating .
for example , if only the angle @xmath49 has a deficit @xmath562 , and other angles @xmath563 have period @xmath72 , a static @xmath3-brane is produced with conical singularity at the origin , @xmath151 ; the deficit @xmath99 is related to the negative mass parameter of the brane @xmath140 @xcite .    as discussed in the previous section ,
if more angles have deficits , then the brane acquires angular momenta as well , and it might become a system of intersecting @xmath504-branes . in @xmath564 dimensions , there can be at most @xmath565 independent / commuting rotations in euclidean planes of the ( @xmath566)-dimensional spatial section in the embedding space
. therefore , the most general codimension - two brane is described by @xmath567 parameters related to conserved charges , _
i.e. _ , the mass @xmath140 , and angular momenta , @xmath568
. this counting matches the fact that there can be at most @xmath567 angular deficits in the angles @xmath569 and @xmath563 , @xmath570 .
the isometry group of ads@xmath539 , @xmath571 , is of rank @xmath567 .
this means that the brane can be described by at most @xmath567 independent parameters , each one corresponding to a generator of the cartan subalgebra .
similarly to the five - dimensional case , the mass parameter is directly related to an angular deficit of a static brane , and @xmath565 angular momenta are related to independent rotations in euclidean planes .
the angular momenta can be alternatively obtained by applying @xmath565 independent boosts , or lorentz transformations , to the static brane along independent angles . to be more precise ,
if @xmath241 are generators of @xmath571 , then the commuting generators of the cartan subalgebra are @xmath572 and @xmath573 , where @xmath570 .
geometrically , the angles @xmath569 and @xmath563 are azimuthal angles in the euclidean planes @xmath545-@xmath548 and @xmath574-@xmath575 , respectively .    furthermore ,
as in the five - dimensional case , the embedding angles @xmath569 and @xmath563 are related to the time coordinate @xmath198 and @xmath565 periodic angles @xmath576 .
the relation between the local coordinates in ads space and those in the embedding space is captured by the invertible matrix @xmath279 that generalizes eq.([mix matrix ] ) , @xmath577 in this notation , a static brane is represented by @xmath578 diag@xmath579 , where @xmath580 , @xmath581 and all other angles are periodic , with periods @xmath72 .
static solutions with different transverse planes also exist , but they simply correspond to different matrices @xmath582 in which the second eigenvalue @xmath99 is moved along the diagonal .
a rotating brane is brought to existence from the static brane by applying at most @xmath565 independent lorentz transformations @xmath583 along the angles @xmath584 , each one introducing a component @xmath585 .
then , the matrix @xmath279 in ( [ u ] ) can be `` unboosted '' to the static brane as @xmath586 .
again , @xmath279 has at most @xmath567 independent components and @xmath587 .
angular deficits of the embedding angles @xmath588 , due to identifications @xmath589 , are read - off from the matrix elements of @xmath279 as @xmath590 $ ] .
these entries correspond to the parameters that characterize the killing vector fields used to identify points in the embedding space , @xmath591 a rotating brane with angular momenta @xmath592 is the quotient of ads@xmath539 space by these identifications .
the spacetime curvature is constant everywhere .
however , as in the previous discussions , the allowed regions of spacetime are those that do not possess closed time - like curves , that is , where all the norms @xmath593 are non - negative . as in five dimensions ,
the causal horizon @xmath594 is a boundary of the
 outer ' region , where all @xmath595 are strictly positive .
the interior is removed from the manifold by an additional transformation that identifies @xmath157 as a set of points with infinite curvature , that is , a source of a codimension - two where the brane is .
explicit expressions for this source can be obtained using the method of nontrivial holonomies , explained in previous sections . in order to analyze non - trivial paths around the horizon
, we choose the vielbein as @xmath596 & & e^{2i+1 } = a\,\upsilon_{1,i-1}\,d\tau _ { i}\ , , \qquad e^{2i+2 } = a\,\upsilon_{1,i-1}\sinh \tau _ { i}\,d\phi_{2i+1,2i+2}\ , ,   \label{e}\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath597 and @xmath598 has been defined in eq.([upsilon ] ) .
then the torsionless spin connection , defined outside the source , has non - vanishing components @xmath599 & & \omega ^{1,2i+2 } = -\frac{b}{\ell a}\,e^{2i+2}\ , , \qquad \omega ^{0,2i+1 } = \sinh \tau _ { i}\,\upsilon_{i+1,p}\,d\phi _ { 0,2p+3}\ , , \nonumber\end{aligned}\ ] ] and with @xmath600 , @xmath601 \omega ^{2i+1,2j+1 } & = & \sinh \tau_{j}\,\upsilon_{i-1,j+1}\,d\tau _ { i}\ , ,   \notag \\ [ 0.3em ] \omega ^{2i+2,2j+1 } & = & \sinh \tau_{i}\,\sinh \tau_{j}\,\upsilon_{i-1,j+1}\,d\phi _ { 2i+1,2i+2}\ , .
\label{w}\end{aligned}\ ] ] the ads connection @xmath511 has the form given by eq.([ads_connection ] ) . as discussed above , the integral of @xmath23 over an infinitesimal surface that contains the horizon is finite , because the coordinate definitions ( [ 012d ] , [ pairs ] ) introduce a curvature singularity : the source of the brane @xmath20 .
this source is located at the causal horizon , that is in general a union of various surfaces @xmath602 coming from different killing vectors .
the only contribution to the integral @xmath603 comes from an abelian subgroup @xmath604 . in euclidean planes ,
the loops around the horizon are parameterized by the azimuthal angles @xmath605 . when the angles have periods smaller than @xmath606 , then @xmath607 , where @xmath608 are the constants whose form depend on the matrix ( [ u ] ) .
when there is no deficit , @xmath609 , and we can drop this term from the source , as it describes a simple @xmath610 rotation , that is an ambiguity in a killing vector that can always be removed .    writing these contributions to @xmath23 in the @xmath611-@xmath612 planes as the 2-forms @xmath613 , we obtain the source of a codimension - two brane in @xmath33 dimensions , @xmath614 \lambda_{0,2p+3}\,\delta \left ( \sigma _ { 0,2p+3}\right ) \notag \\ & & + \frac{2\pi}{\ell } \,\sum_{i=1}^{p}\left [ \upsilon_{1,i-1}\sinh \tau_{i}\left ( a_*\,\mathbf{j}_{2i+2,2p+3}-b_*\ , \mathbf{j}_{1,2i+2}\right ) + \ell \cosh \tau_{i}\,\mathbf{j}_{2i+2,2i+1}\right . \notag
\\ & & \qquad + \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i , j=1}^{p}\left .
\ell \sinh \tau_{i}\,\sinh \tau_{j}\,\upsilon_{i-1,j+1}\,\mathbf{j}_{2i+2,2j+1 } \right ] \lambda _ { 2i+1,2i+2}\,\delta \left ( \sigma _ { 2i+1,2i+2}\right)\,.\end{aligned}\ ] ] not all dirac delta 2-forms @xmath615 are independent sources , because @xmath616 are euclidean planes in the embedding space @xmath541 and @xmath615 has to be expressed in the ads coordinates .
a more explicit form of @xmath20 depends on the number of angular momenta and the identification under consideration .    in the next subsection
, we will show that these spinning 2-branes can be stable in the framework of cs supergravity .
consider a cs supergravity with @xmath285 gravitini for some super ads group .
the smallest superalgebras that contain the ads@xmath539 are constructed and classified in @xmath564 dimensions in ref.@xcite . a spinor @xmath617 ( @xmath618 ) with @xmath619 components , transforms as a vector in some internal subalgebra @xmath620 , @xmath621 or @xmath622 , depending on the dimension of spacetime ; generically , the superalgebra also contains additional bosonic generators required by its closure .
a @xmath3-brane solution of the theory is a bps configuration if its gauge connection @xmath511 corresponds to ( [ ads_connection ] , [ e][w ] ) , with all other fields set to zero , and it admits nontrivial killing spinors @xmath520 satisfying eq .
( [ k - spinor - eq ] ) .
as we show below , in order to satisfy this requirement , the brane geometry must have at least one nonzero component of the angular momentum .
killing spinors have been calculated in ref.@xcite , and they have the form @xmath623 the function @xmath624 is the same as before , and @xmath625 ( @xmath626 ) are the ( @xmath627-dimensional gamma matrices and @xmath516 is a constant spinor .
since the set of matrices @xmath628 mutually commute and have eigenvalues @xmath629 , the spinor @xmath516 can be chosen as their common eigenvector , @xmath630 furthermore , the matrix @xmath631 , proportional to the product @xmath632 , can be normalized as @xmath633 then , the spinor @xmath634 adopts the form @xmath635    in order to have a globally defined , @xmath520 it is necessary to impose periodicity conditions in the angles @xmath636 . from the matrix @xmath279 with the matrix elements
@xmath637 in eq.([u ] ) , we find that a change @xmath638 of the @xmath639-th angle ( @xmath640 ) , induces a change in the embedding angles @xmath641 thus , for fixed @xmath197 , @xmath642 and @xmath643 ( @xmath644 ) , the spinor changes as @xmath645 requiring that the spinor be periodic or antiperiodic function of the angles , @xmath646 , one obtains @xmath565 independent conditions on the parameters , @xmath647 these conditions _ linear _ in the parameters are always satisfied by the global ads@xmath539 , for which @xmath648 . also , these conditions are never satisfied by static branes , where there is only one parameter in the interval @xmath649 . however , with at least two independent parameters , above equations present the extremality conditions between the sets of parameters that are , as we saw before , related to the conserved charges @xmath140 and @xmath585 of the theory . similarly as in five dimensions , these linear conditions that define the bps states do not coincide for @xmath650 with the _ non - linear _ conditions of the extremality of angular momentum .    the extremality conditions ( [ extremal_d ] ) applied to five - dimensional 2-branes ,
reproduce results discussed in section [ bps in 5d ] .
the bps states described here are easily generalized when other forms of cs matter are added , as for example a @xmath4 field . for static codimension - two branes ,
this case was analyzed in ref.@xcite .
this paper is devoted to the study of codimension - two branes in ads@xmath651 spacetimes .
the branes are classified by a set of parameters \{@xmath652 related to their mass and angular momenta .
the construction is based on the introduction of killing vector identifications in the embedding space @xmath653 of global ads@xmath16 , where the above parameters become angular deficits .
these identifications have fixed points and produce configurations that are locally ads , but whose global structure is changed and describe a variety of @xmath3-brane configurations .    in this construction , one is faced with entire regions of spacetime that admit closed time - like curves .
they are removed by an additional identification of the causal horizon with a point .
the last identification , which is not produced by a killing vector , keeps the manifold locally ads everywhere , except at the point defining the causal horizon , where the riemann curvature becomes infinite . in the field equations ,
this is presented as a brane source .
the source generically has the form of a dirac delta distribution without derivatives , contrary to recent reports in the literature ( see , _
e.g. _ , @xcite ) .
this is possible on account of a non - vanishing torsion at the singular locus defining the position of the brane .
our construction guarantees that the ads curvature satisfies @xmath24 , independently on the form of the action .
this means that , without a source , any action admitting global ads as a solution can also have these ( spinning ) branes as exact solutions . in order to include the sources
, a suitable interaction also has to be added in the action .
geometrically , the manifolds obtained in this article present one or more ( maximally @xmath654 $ ] ) spinning codimension - two branes that intersect . thus , the source is a sum of at most @xmath654 $ ] independent dirac delta distributions , each one associated to one ( @xmath22)-brane , or one killing vector identification in ads@xmath16 space .
this discussion is restricted to the branes that possess a static limit , _
i.e. _ , that reduce to the static ( @xmath22)-brane in the absence of angular momenta .
a construction of this class of spinning branes is shown to be equivalent to a boosting along an azimuthal angle of the static brane , in the spirit of ref.@xcite , where a similar analysis has been done for the btz black hole @xcite .
our approach to obtain a higher - dimensional ( @xmath22)-brane from the three - dimensional 0-brane is to thicken it ( by introducing further internal coordinates ) , thus it is natural to expect that there exist more than one inequivalent ways to do this kind of embedding .
furthermore , since identifications of ads space with or without fixed points produce branes or black holes , respectively , it would be quite interesting to study combined identifications where both branes and black holes are formed .
all those cases that lead to nontrivial global geometries are left for future discussion . in particular
, a general analysis like the one performed in @xcite seems as necessary as cumbersome .
extremal spinning branes are not included in this analysis , because they would correspond to a boost whose velocity is equal to the speed of light .
coordinate transformations that exhibit this killing vector identification are not well - defined in the extremal limit either .
the non - extremality condition , however , does not mean that extremal spinning branes do not exist , but that they should be constructed from a different killing vector identification .
indeed , in three dimensions , extremal spinning branes have been obtained from identifications in ads@xmath38 in ref.@xcite .
this extremal spinning 0-brane should be thickened and embedded in higher dimensions similarly as in the non - extremal case , in order to give rise to the extremal codimension - two brane in @xmath17 dimensions .    to understand the geometry of spinning branes that satisfy @xmath15
, one does not need to know an action  all actions that have as particular solution @xmath15 will do the job .
this could be , for example , any action from the class of lovelock actions that generalize general relativity in higher dimensions .
in particular , einstein - hilbert action with negative cosmological constant has described spinning branes as solutions in any dimension .    without knowing the action
, one can not calculate conserved charges in the theory , but one can relate the free parameters \{@xmath652 of the configuration to its mass and angular momenta by their comparison to some known asymptotically ads solution , for example the btz black hole .
this is possible because the set of independent parameters is equivalent to the set of casimir invariants , thus equivalent to the gauge invariant charges .
one question that naturally comes to mind in the presence of these @xmath504-branes which do not affect the local curvature , but modify the topology , is about the experimental tests that could be performed to detect them .
a related problem is how would one distinguish these solutions from other configurations by looking at them from far away .
it has been recently shown that black holes and naked singularities can be observationally distinguished through their gravitational lensing properties . when used as gravitational lenses , a black hole and a naked singularity of the same mass and symmetries give rise to different number of images of the same light source .
they also possess different orientations , magnification and time delays of images . for more ,
e.g. _ , refs.@xcite .    in order to analyze the stability of the brane solutions discussed here
requires knowing the full theory , as it involves perturbing the fields in the vicinity of the solution @xmath15 , and studying their dynamics from the equations of motion .
we have performed this analysis in the case of cs supergravity , where we showed that there are bps states that preserve a fraction of the original supersymmetry .
sources can be incorporated in a theory by adding to the action the couplings between the external currents @xmath20 and gravitational and matter fields .
we are interested in cs ads supergravity in odd dimensions , where the ads connection is a fundamental field .
as discussed in @xcite , gauge invariant and background - independent couplings between a @xmath3-brane and a connection is provided by the generalization of the minimal coupling , where the role of the vector potential is played by the @xmath655-cs form .
the bosonic sector of this supergravity is of the lovelock type and it has the unique ads vacuum @xmath15 . this vacuum is a degenerate zero of the cs field equations , that means that linear perturbation analysis is not well - defined in this background .
this problem is circumvented in the supersymmetric case , by showing that the solution @xmath15 preserves some supersymmetries and , using symmetry arguments , that it must be a stable state whose charges saturate the bogomolnyi bound in this background .
the situation in which there is no well - defined linear approximation around some very symmetric background is typical for higher - dimensional cs theories @xcite .
the problem is originated in the so - called irregular sectors of the phase space , where the canonical hamiltonian analysis is not applicable . in these sectors , local symmetry increases and the number of physical degrees of freedom decreases @xcite .
these sectors are not open sets in phase space , they are submanifolds of measure zero , and one can avoid them by adding to the background a suitable bosonic cs matter @xcite . in that way , one can work in the ads background in cs gravity even without involving supersymmetry .
recently , another solution involving chern - simons coupling has been discussed in the context of electric - magnetic duality @xcite .
this magnetically charged solution is geometrically like a dirac string , but it might be also electrically charged .

"the difference equations play an increasing role in science .
we have learned to appreciate the inherent discreteness of physical phenomena at the atomic and subatomic level . also in modern theoretical physics the assumption of a space - time continuum
is often being abandoned .
apart from physics difference equations have numerous applications , e.g. , in numerical analysis , computer science , mathematical biology and economics .
the domain of discrete ( difference ) systems forms nowadays one of the focal points in integrable systems research .
also the connection between geometry and integrability , well known in the case of integrable differential equations @xcite , has been transferred to the discrete level ( see @xcite and references therein ) .
a successful general approach towards description of this relation is provided by the theory of multidimensional quadrilateral lattices ( qls ) @xcite .
these are just maps @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) of multidimensional integer lattice into projective space , with planar elementary quadrilaterals . the integrable partial difference equation counterpart of the qls are the discrete darboux equations ( see section [ sec : mql - affine ] for details ) , being found first @xcite as the most general difference system integrable by the non - local @xmath2 dressing method .
it turns out that integrability of the discrete darboux system is encoded in a very simple geometric statement ( see fig .
[ fig : titjtkx ] ) .
[ lem : gen - hex ] consider points @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 in general position in @xmath7 , @xmath8 . on the plane
@xmath9 , @xmath10 choose a point @xmath11 not on the lines @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 . then there exists the unique point @xmath15 which belongs simultaneously to the three planes @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .
integrable reductions of the quadrilateral lattice ( and thus of the discrete darboux equations ) arise from additional constraints which are compatible with geometric integrability scheme ( see , for example @xcite ) . because application of several integrable reductions preserves integrability of the lattice , it is important to isolate the basic ones .
integrable constraints of the quadrilateral lattice may have local or global nature .
the global constraints are related with existence of an additional geometric structure in the projective space which allows to impose some restrictions on the lattice .
the reduction considered in this paper can be described within the affine geometry approach .
the differential darboux equations , which have appeared first in projective differential geometry of multidimensional conjugate nets @xcite , play an important role @xcite in the multicomponent kadomtsev 
petviashvilii ( kp ) hierarchy , which is commonly considered @xcite as the fundamental system of equations in integrability theory .
one of the most important reductions of the kp hierarchy of nonlinear equations is the so called ckp hierarchy @xcite ( here  c ' appears in the context of the classification theory of simple lie algebras ) . in @xcite
it was shown that the differential darboux equations of the multicomponent kp hierarchy should be in this case supplemented by certain symmetry condition .
in fact such equations were considered first within the differential geometry context in @xcite .
their discrete counterpart was studied in @xcite under the name of the symmetric quadrilateral lattice . in @xcite
the symmetric darboux equations have been solved by the non - local @xmath2 dressing method .
the corresponding reduction of the fundamental transformation @xcite of ql was given on the algebraic level in @xcite .
within the context of the so called darboux maps such a reduction of the discrete darboux equations was studied in @xcite , where the system was reformulated in a convenient scalar form ( see also @xcite ) and related with the superposition formulas for the darboux transformations of the ckp hierarchy . in @xcite such special darboux maps were characterized geometrically using the classical pascal s theorem for hexagons inscribed in conics . also the bcklund transformation for such maps
was investigated geometrically in @xcite .
in fact , the attempt to understand results of @xcite in the quadrilateral lattice approach was my motivation to undertake again , after @xcite , studies of the symmetric reduction of the darboux equations .    an important reduction of the quadrilateral lattice with the symmetric rotation coefficients is the egorov lattice @xcite .
it was solved in @xcite using the inverse spectral transform . in @xcite
the algebro - geometric techniques were used to construct large class of such lattices . in 1998
peter grinevich isolated from @xcite these of the algebro - geometric conditions which give rise the symmetric quadrilateral lattices @xcite .
the main goal of the paper is to give new pure geometric characterization of the symmetric quadrilateral lattice and of the corresponding reduction of the fundamental transformation . because of the intimate relation of the lattice with the discrete ckp equation we will call it also the c - quadrilateral lattice .
we study the geometric and algebraic properties of the cql reduction of the fundamental transformation .
in particular , we show that the reduced transformation satisfies the bianchi permutability principle .
to make the theory of such lattices complete we apply the algebro - geometric techniques to construct large classes of the lattices together with corresponding solutions of the darboux equations . in doing that we introduce the backward and the dual baker 
akhiezer functions of the quadrilateral lattice .
the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : mql - affine ]
we summarize relevant facts from the quadrilateral lattice theory and we introduce the notation . in section [ sec : cql ] we introduce new geometric definition of the c - quadrilateral lattice and we study its integrability ( multidimensional consistency ) using geometric means .
we also present its algebraic description in terms of symmetric darboux equations .
section [ sec : ag ] is devoted to presentation of the algebro - geometric construction of the c - quadrilateral ( symmetric ) lattices . in section [ sec : c - fund ] we introduce geometrically the c - reduction of the fundamental transformation of the quadrilateral lattice @xcite and we link it with the earlier algebraic results of @xcite . we also prove the corresponding permutability theorem for this transformation .
finally in the appendix we present briefly the relation between the darboux maps @xcite and the quadrilateral lattices .
the main geometric results of the paper were presented on the lms research symposium _ methods of integrable systems in geometry _ , durham , uk ( august , 2006 ) .
it is my pleasure to thank the organizers of the meeting for invitation and support .
consider a multidimensional quadrilateral lattice ( mql ) ; i.  e. , a mapping @xmath19 , @xmath1 , with all the elementary quadrilaterals planar @xcite ; here @xmath20 is the @xmath21-dimensional integer lattice , and @xmath22 is @xmath23-dimensional projective space over the field @xmath24 . in the affine gauge ( which will be extremely useful in the paper ) the lattice
is represented by a mapping @xmath25 and the planarity condition can be formulated in terms of the laplace equations @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the translation operator in the @xmath28-th direction , and @xmath29 is the corresponding partial difference operator .    due to compatibility of the system the coefficients
@xmath30 satisfy the mql ( or discrete darboux ) system of equations @xmath31 the @xmath32 symmetry of rhs of implies existence of the potentials @xmath33 , @xmath34 , ( called the lam coefficients ) such that @xmath35 if we introduce the suitably scaled tangent vectors @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 then equations can be rewritten as a first order system expressing the fact that @xmath39th variation of @xmath36 is proportional to @xmath40 only @xmath41 the proportionality factors @xmath42 , called the rotation coefficients , can be found from the linear equations @xmath43 adjoint to
. the compatibility condition for the system   ( or its adjoint ) gives the following new form of the discrete darboux equations @xmath44      the backward tangent vectors @xmath46 , @xmath47 , are defined similarly to the forward tangent vectors @xmath36 but with the help of the backward shifts @xmath48 and of the backward difference operator @xmath49 : @xmath50 we define also the backward rotation coefficients @xmath51 as the corresponding proportionality factors .
notice that the backward tangent vectors @xmath46 satisfy the adjoint linear system .
the backward lam coefficients @xmath52 , , @xmath47 , are defined by @xmath53 and satisfy the system @xmath54 as a consequence of equations or equations the functions @xmath51 satisfy the mql equations  .
define backward laplace coefficients @xmath55 then @xmath56 satisfies the backward laplace equation @xmath57    the connection factors @xmath58 are the proportionality coefficients between @xmath36 and @xmath59 ( both vectors are proportional to @xmath60 ) : @xmath61 other forward and backward data of the lattice @xmath56 are related through the following formulas @xmath62 moreover , the factors @xmath63 are satisfy equations @xmath64 which imply existence of yet another potential ( the @xmath45-function of the quadrilateral lattice ) such that @xmath65    given a quadrilateral lattice @xmath56 , the forward data @xmath66 and the backward data @xmath67 are defined up to rescaling by functions @xmath68 , @xmath69 of single variables @xmath70 then also @xmath71    since @xmath42 and @xmath51 are both solutions of the discrete darboux equations , then equations - describe a special symmetry transformations of , first found in @xcite without any associated geometric meaning .
the geometric arena , where the reduction of the quadrilateral lattice studied in this paper lives , is the affine space . recall that the affine transformations are these projective transformations which leave invariant a fixed hyperplane @xmath72 , called the hyperplane at infinity ( see , for example @xcite ) .
two lines of @xmath73 ( identified with @xmath74 , up to fixing the origin ) are called parallel if they intersect in a point of @xmath75    [ def : c - hexahedron ] a hexahedron with planar faces in the affine space @xmath76 is called a _
c - hexahedron _ if the three points obtained by intersection of the common lines of the pairs of planes of its opposite faces with the hyperplane @xmath75 at infinity are collinear ( see figure  [ fig : cql - constr ] ) .
we exclude for a time being from our considerations the degenerate case when a pair of opposite faces of the hexahedron is parallel , i.  e. their common line belongs to @xmath75 .
equivalently the c - hexahedron is characterized by coplanarity of suitable parallel shifts of the intersection lines of the opposite face planes .
[ def : c - hex ] a quadrilateral lattice @xmath77 is called a _ c - quadrilateral lattice _ ( cql ) if all its hexahedra are c - hexahedra .
the following proposition gives an analytic characterization of c - quadrilateral lattices in terms of their rotation coefficients .
[ prop : q3-cql ] a quadrilateral lattice is subject to c - reduction if and only if its rotation coefficients satisfy the constraint @xmath78    denote by @xmath79 ( @xmath80 are distinct ) the direction vector of the common line of the plane @xmath81 and its @xmath82-opposite @xmath83 . it must be therefore decomposed in the basis @xmath84 and in the basis @xmath85 . assuming its decomposition in the second basis we get @xmath86 where we have used the linear problem . because the coefficient in front of @xmath87 must vanish , the vector can be therefore chosen as @xmath88 notice that the condition in definition  [ def : c - hex ] is equivalent to to coplanarity of the vectors @xmath79 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 , and the statement follows from equation @xmath91    in the degenerate case , when a pair of opposite faces of the hexahedron is parallel , the corresponding rotation coefficients vanish . because they appear on different sides of equation ,
then the constraint is automatically satisfied .
as it was shown in @xcite , the constraint allows to rescale the forward and backward data , using possibility given by equations - , to the form such that @xmath92 i.e. , the rotation coefficients of cql are , in a sense , _ symmetric _ with respect to interchanging of their indices .
under such a constraint equations and allow to express the rotation coefficients in terms of the @xmath45-function as follows  @xcite @xmath93 then the discrete darboux equations equations can be rewritten in the following quartic form @xmath94 called in  @xcite the discrete ckp equation .
finally , we present a result which we will use in section [ sec : c - fund ] .
its formal algebraic proof can be found in @xcite but , essentially , it uses the facts that ( i ) the functions @xmath63 connect solutions of the forward and backward linear problems , ( ii ) a solution of the adjoint linear problem is connected in this correspondence with solution of the linear problem but with backward rotation coefficients , and ( iii ) backward and forward rotation coefficients in the cql reduction coincide .
[ lem - ry*-y ] given solution @xmath95 of the adjoint linear problem for `` symmetric '' rotation coefficients then @xmath96 satisfies the corresponding linear problem .
as it was shown in @xcite the planarity condition , which allows to construct the point @xmath15 as in lemma [ lem : gen - hex ] , does not lead to any further restrictions if we increase dimension of the lattice .
because in the cql case the constraint is imposed on the 3d ( elementary hexahedra ) level , then to assure its multidimensional consistency we have to check the four dimensional consistency .
the multidimensional consistency of the c - reduction with the geometric integrability scheme would be the immediate consequence of its 4d consistency .
in fact , the consistency of the constraint has been proved algebraically in @xcite starting from its algebraic form .
however , in that proof the main difficulty was shifted to the proof of existence ( in multidimensions ) of the special choice of the @xmath45-function . in this paper
we present pure geometric proof of the 4d consistency of the cql .
we first recall the relevant result on four dimensional consistency of the ql , which is the consequence of the of the following geometric observation .
[ lem:4d - consist - ql ] consider points @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath97 in general position in @xmath7 , @xmath98 . choose generic points
@xmath99 , @xmath100 , on the corresponding planes , and using the planarity condition construct the points @xmath101 , @xmath102  the remaining vertices of the four ( combinatorial ) cubes
. then the intersection point @xmath103 of the three planes @xmath104 coincides with the intersection point of the three planes @xmath105 which is the same as the intersection point of the three planes @xmath106 and the intersection point of the three planes @xmath107    in fact , the point @xmath103 is the unique intersection point of the four three dimensional subspaces @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 of the four dimensional subspace @xmath112 .
this observation generalizes naturally to the case of more dimensional hypercube with the planar facets .
it turns out that the geometric core of the integrability of cql is provided by the gallucci s theorem on eight skew lines ( see , for example @xcite ) .
if three skew lines all meet three other skew lines , any transversal to the first set of three meets any transversal to the second set .    motivated by the corresponding results of @xcite we first prove a useful lemma , where the gallucci theorem is used .
[ lem : c - consistency ] consider four adjacent hexahedra with planar faces which share a vertex of a 4d hypercube . if three of them are c - hexahedra then the same holds also for the forth one .    we start from generic 4d hexahedron with planar faces .
denote by @xmath113 the three dimensional subspace of @xmath75 being its intersection with the 4d subspace @xmath114 of the hexahedron .
by @xmath115 denote the intersection line of the 3d subspace @xmath116 of one of the four 3d hexahedra with @xmath75 .
denote by @xmath117 the intersection points of the opposite planes @xmath9
, @xmath118 of the four 3d hexahedra with @xmath75 ( all indices are distinct and range from @xmath119 to @xmath120 , eventually they should be reordered ) ; these are the points entering into the definition of the c - hexahedra .
by @xmath121 denote the intersection lines of the three dimensional subspaces @xmath122 , @xmath123 and @xmath75 . there are four lines of this type ( the @xmath124-family ) .
notice that point @xmath117 is the intersection point of @xmath125 with the plane @xmath115 . on the plane @xmath115
we have therefore apart from three collinear point @xmath126 , @xmath127 and @xmath128 ( they belong to @xmath121 ) also three other points @xmath117 , @xmath129 and @xmath130 .
the c - reduction condition of the hexahedron with with vertices @xmath3 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 and @xmath133 means collinearity of the points points @xmath117 , @xmath129 and @xmath130 .
if such a line exists we denote it by @xmath134 .
it intersects not only lines @xmath125 , @xmath135 and @xmath136 ( in points @xmath117 , @xmath129 and @xmath130 , correspondingly ) , but also the fourth line @xmath121 of the @xmath124-family , as both lines belong to the plane @xmath115 .
let us assume that the c - reduction condition is satisfied for three hexahedra , i.e. , three such @xmath137-lines exist , all transversal to four @xmath124-lines .
assume that @xmath134 , @xmath138 and @xmath139 exist , define the line @xmath140 as the unique line passing through the points @xmath141 and @xmath142 , thus transversal to the lines @xmath135 and @xmath125 .
because @xmath140 is contained in @xmath143 then it must intersect also the line @xmath136  the third line of the @xmath124-family . by gallucci
s theorem it intersects therefore the forth line @xmath121 .
that intersection point belongs to the plane @xmath143 ( containing the points @xmath141 and @xmath142 which define @xmath140 ) therefore it must be @xmath144 .
we have therefore shown that also the three points @xmath141 , @xmath142 and @xmath128 are collinear , i.e. , @xmath145 .
under hypotheses of lemma  [ lem : gen - hex ] assume that the c - reduction condition is satisfied for 3d hexahedra meeting in one vertex of a 4d hypercube .
then the condition holds for all hexahedra of the hypercube .    without loss of generality
assume that the common vertex of the four hexahedra ( we know that it is enough to assume the c - reduction condition for three of them ) is @xmath3 . then three of them share the vertex @xmath131 , which implies the constraint for the forth one .
all remaining four hexahedra of the 4d hypercube which do not share the point @xmath3 are of that type .
on the level of the multidimensional quadrilateral lattice there exists simple alternative algebraic proof of an analogue of lemma  [ lem : c - consistency ] , which combined with ideas behind the proof of proposition  [ prop : q3-cql ] would give the algebraic proof of the lemma .
consider a 4d hexahedron withe vertices @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath148 , @xmath149 , @xmath150 of the quadrilateral lattice @xmath151 , @xmath152 .
if three of the four 3d hexahedra meeting in the vertex @xmath146 are the c - hexahedra then the same holds also for the forth one .
assume that the fourth one is the hexahedron with basic vertices @xmath146 , @xmath148 , @xmath149 and @xmath150 .
by proposition  [ prop : q3-cql ] the c - reduction condition for the remaining three reads @xmath153 multiplying the equations we obtain ( assuming that the rotation coefficients do not vanish ) @xmath154
in this section we apply the algebro - geometric approach , well known in the theory of integrable systems @xcite , to the symmetric darboux equations and to the c - quadrilateral lattice .
similar restrictions on the algebro - geometric data appeared in @xcite in construction of quasi periodic solutions of the ckp hierarchy . for discrete laplace equations
the algebro - geometric techniques were first applied in @xcite . in @xcite the egorov reduction of the symmetric lattice @xcite was studied by means of the algebro - geometric methods . in 1998 peter grinevich isolated from @xcite these of the algebro - geometric conditions which give rise the symmetric quadrilateral lattices @xcite .
below we present that result on algebro - geometric description of the c-(symmetric ) quadrilateral lattice within broader context of various discrete baker  akhiezer functions .
in this section we work over the field of complex numbers , i.e. , @xmath155 , and we discuss the corresponding reality condintions .
we mention that many of the results gien below can be transferred to the finite - field case , as in @xcite .
let us consider a compact non - degenerate riemann surface @xmath156 of genus @xmath137 , a non - special divisor @xmath157 on @xmath156 , the @xmath21 pairs of points @xmath158 , and the normalization point @xmath159 .
the system @xmath160 is called _ the algebro - geometric data _ used in the construction of the quadrilateral lattice . for simplicity
we assume that all the points above ( including the points of @xmath161 ) are distinct .    for @xmath162
we define the meromorphic function @xmath163 by prescribing its analytical properties : + ( i ) as a function on @xmath164 it may may have as singularities only simple poles in points of the divisor @xmath161 ; + ( ii ) in points @xmath165 ( in points @xmath166 ) it has poles ( correspondingly , zeros ) of the order @xmath167 , where by the pole of the negative order we mean zero of the corresponding order ; + ( iii ) in the point @xmath168 the function @xmath169 is normalized to @xmath119 .    by the standard ( see @xcite ) application of the riemann  roch theorem ,
such a function exists and is unique .
when @xmath170 is a local coordinate centered at @xmath171 then @xmath169 in a neighbourhood of the point @xmath171 is of the form @xmath172 by the standard reasoning in the finite - gap theory one can prove the following result @xcite which connects the function @xmath169 with the quadrilateral lattice theory .    for arbitrary point @xmath173 the baker 
akhiezer function @xmath169 satisfies in the variable @xmath162 the following system of linear equations @xmath174    [ cor : measure ] let @xmath175 be a vector valued measure on @xmath156 , then the function @xmath176 given by @xmath177 defines a quadrilateral lattice ( in the complex affine space ) with the functions @xmath178 as the lam coefficients @xmath179 .
similarly one shows hat @xmath56 satisfies the backward laplace equations with the backward lam coefficients ( proportional to ) @xmath180 ; see also proposition [ prop : t - psi ] .    in order to have real quadrilateral lattices we must impose on the algebro - geometric data certain reality restrictions .
[ cor : reality ] assume that the riemann surface @xmath156 allows for an anti - holomorphic involution @xmath181 . if @xmath182 then the lattice @xmath56 , given by equation is real .
moreover , if the local coordinate systems @xmath183 are compatible with @xmath181 , i.e. , @xmath184 then the lam coefficients , as defined above , are real functions .      in this section
we define auxiliary baker - akhiezer functions which play the role of the forward and backward normalized tangent vectors .
then we define the dual ( adjoint ) baker - akhiezer function of the quadrilateral lattice .
below we consider new functions @xmath185 whose relation to @xmath169 is analogous to that between @xmath36 to @xmath56 .
given @xmath162 define @xcite the functions @xmath186 as meromorphic functions on @xmath156 having the following analytic properties : + ( i ) as a function on @xmath187 it may have as singularities only simple poles in points of the divisor @xmath161 ; + ( ii ) in points @xmath188 ( in points @xmath189 ) it has poles of the order @xmath190 ( correspondingly , zeros of the order @xmath191 ) ; + ( iii ) in the point @xmath168 the function @xmath169 is equal to @xmath192 .    by the riemann 
roch theorem the space of such functions is one dimensional . by choosing local
coordinate @xmath193 near @xmath165 the function @xmath185 can be made unique by fixing its lowest order term at @xmath165 to one .
then near @xmath194 we have the following local expansions @xmath195    [ th : psi - i - ag ] the functions @xmath185 satisfy the equations @xmath196 whose expansion at @xmath197 , gives @xmath198 and allows for the identification @xmath199    in notation of corollary [ cor : measure ] we have @xmath200    notice that different choices of local coordinates @xmath193 correspond to rescaling of the forward data in agreement with equation .
we define the corresponding algebro - geometric analog of the backward normalized tangent vectors @xmath46 .
given @xmath162 define the functions @xmath202 as meromorphic functions on @xmath156 having the following analytic properties : + ( i ) as a function on @xmath187 it may may have as singularities only simple poles in points of the divisor @xmath161 ; + ( ii ) in points @xmath188 ( in points @xmath189 ) it has poles of the order @xmath191 ( correspondingly , zeros of the order @xmath203 ) ; + ( iii ) in the point @xmath168 the function @xmath169 is equal to @xmath192 .    by the riemann 
roch theorem the space of such functions is one dimensional . by choosing local coordinates
@xmath204 near @xmath166 the function @xmath201 can be made unique by fixing its lowest order term at @xmath166 to one .
then near @xmath194 we have the following local expansions @xmath205 by the standard methods @xcite one can prove the following analog of theorem [ th : psi - i - ag ]    [ prop : t - psi ] the functions @xmath169 and @xmath201 are connected by the formulas @xmath206 whose expansion at @xmath207 , gives @xmath208 and allows for the identification @xmath209    in notation of corollary [ cor : measure ] we have @xmath210 moreover , by comparing the analytical properties the functions @xmath185 and @xmath201 we obtain @xmath211 which allows for the identification @xmath212    notice that different choices of local coordinates @xmath204 correspond to rescaling of the backward data given by equation .
we are not concerned here about explicit theta - function formulas for the baker 
akhiezer functions and related potentials , see however @xcite .
in particular , the @xmath45-function of the quadrilateral lattice is , essentially @xcite , the riemann theta function .      in definition of the dual ( adjoint ) baker 
akhiezer function of the quadrilateral lattice we use the idea applied in @xcite to construction of the adjoint baker
 akhiezer function of the kp hierarchy .
denote by @xmath213 the meromorphic differential with the only singularity being the second order pole at @xmath168 , and whose holomorphic part is normalized by vanishing of @xmath213 at points of the divisor @xmath161 @xmath214    by choosing a coordinate system @xmath215 centered at @xmath168 the differential @xmath213 can be made unique by fixing its singular part in @xmath215 as @xmath216 but we will not use that in the sequel .
denote by @xmath217 the divisor of other @xmath137 zeros of @xmath213 , and use it to define the dual baker 
akhiezer function @xmath218 exchanging also the role of the points @xmath165 and @xmath166 : +
( i ) as a function on @xmath219 it may may have as singularities only simple poles in points of the divisor @xmath217 ; + ( ii ) in points @xmath165 ( in points @xmath166 ) it has zeros ( correspondingly , poles ) of the order @xmath167 ; + ( iii ) in the point @xmath168 the function @xmath218 is normalized to @xmath119 .    using the riemann 
roch theorem one can show that such function @xmath220 exists and is unique . in a neighbourhood of the point @xmath171
it is of the form @xmath221 using the similar procedure like in the previous section it can be shown that the dual function @xmath218 satisfies the laplace equations with lam coefficients @xmath222 , and it satisfies the backward laplace equations with the backward lam coefficients @xmath223 .
the meromorphic differential form @xmath224 is singular only at @xmath168 with the singularity being the second order pole . by the residue theorem
the integral of @xmath225 around a closed contour around @xmath168 vanishes , which is the quadrilateral lattice counterpart of the celebrated bilinear identity @xcite on the algebro - geometric level .    in analogy to the baker 
akhiezer functions @xmath185 and @xmath201 we may define the corresponding dual baker  akhiezer functions . in the sequel
we will need the analog of @xmath201 , which is defined as follows .
given @xmath162 define the functions @xmath226 as meromorphic functions on @xmath156 having the following analytic properties : + ( i ) as a function on @xmath227 it may may have as singularities only simple poles in points of the divisor @xmath217 ; + ( ii ) in points @xmath188 ( in points @xmath189 ) it has zeros of the order @xmath203 ( correspondingly , poles of the order @xmath191 ) ; + ( iii ) in the point @xmath168 the function @xmath228 is equal to @xmath192 .    by the riemann
 roch the space of such functions is one dimensional . by choosing local coordinates
@xmath193 near @xmath165 the function @xmath229 can be made unique by fixing its lowest order term at @xmath165 to one .
then near @xmath194 we have the following local expansions @xmath230 as before one can study the relation between @xmath169 and @xmath229 .
however , we will be interested in the following connection formulas between the @xmath231-coefficients of both functions .
[ prop : omega - z - z ] denote by @xmath232 the first coefficients of the expansion of @xmath213 near points @xmath171 @xmath233dz_i^\pm(p),\ ] ] then by vanishing of the sum of residues of the differential @xmath234 we have @xmath235      finally , we show that under certain restrictions on the algebro - geometric data the finite - gap construction gives c - reduced quadrilateral lattice . this type of restrictions appeared in @xcite in construction of quasi - periodic solutions of the ckp hierarchy .
[ prop : cql - alg - geom ] assume that @xmath156 is equipped with the holomorphic involution @xmath236 such that @xmath237 then @xmath238    in the standard way we compare analytic properties of both sides of each equation .
the function @xmath239 has the following analytic properties : + ( i ) as a function on @xmath187 it may have as singularities only simple poles in points of the divisor @xmath217 ; + ( ii ) in points @xmath165 ( in points @xmath166 ) it has zeros ( correspondingly , poles ) of the order @xmath167 ; + ( iii ) in the point @xmath168 the function @xmath239 is normalized to @xmath119 .
+ comparison with the analytic properties of @xmath218 and the riemann 
roch theorem gives equation .
let us describe the analytic properties of the superposition @xmath240 : + ( i ) as a function on @xmath187 it may may have as singularities only simple poles in points of the divisor @xmath217 ; + ( ii ) in points @xmath188 ( in points @xmath189 ) it has zeros of the order @xmath203 ( correspondingly , poles of the order @xmath191 ) ; + ( iii ) in the point @xmath168 the function @xmath240 is equal to @xmath192 .
+ therefore the function @xmath240 must be proportional to @xmath228 .
notice that when the local coordinates , which fix normalization of the functions , are chosen in agreement with the involution @xmath241 @xmath242 then the proportionality in equation becomes equality ( i.e. , @xmath243 ) .
moreover , under such conditions the expansions and give @xmath244    under assumptions of proposition [ prop : cql - alg - geom ] , the quadrilateral lattice constructed according to corollary [ cor : measure ] is subject to the c-(symmetric ) reduction .
assume for a time being that the local coordinates @xmath193 are chosen in such a way that the first coefficients @xmath245 of the expansion of @xmath213 near points @xmath165 are equal ( see proposition [ prop : omega - z - z ] ) , and the local coordinates @xmath204 are chosen according to equation ; we may think of this special choice as using the allowed freedom - in definition of the backward and forward data .
then equations and imply that @xmath246
we introduce geometrically the c - reduction of the fundamental transformation of the quadrilateral lattice .
we also connect this definition with earlier algebraic results of @xcite .
then we prove the corresponding permutability theorem for this transformation .
let us first recall some basic facts concerning the vectorial fundamental transformation of the quadrilateral lattice .
geometrically , the ( scalar ) fundamental transformation is the relation between two quadrilateral lattices @xmath146 and @xmath247 such that for each direction @xmath28 the points @xmath146 , @xmath247 , @xmath248 and @xmath249 are coplanar .
we present below the algebraic description of its vectorial extension ( see @xcite for details ) in the affine formalism .
given the solution @xmath250 , of the linear system , and given the solution @xmath251 , of the linear system .
these allow to construct the linear operator valued potential @xmath252 , defined by @xmath253 similarly , one defines @xmath254 and @xmath255 by @xmath256    if @xmath257 is invertible then the vector function @xmath258 given by @xmath259 represents a quadrilateral lattice ( the fundamental transform of @xmath146 ) , whose lam coefficients @xmath260 , normalized tangent vectors @xmath261 and rotation coefficients @xmath262 are given by @xmath263 moreover @xcite , the connection coefficients @xmath63 and the @xmath45-function transform according to @xmath264    the vectorial fundamental transformation can be considered as superposition of @xmath265 ( scalar ) fundamental transformations ; on intermediate stages the rest of the transformation data should be suitably transformed as well .
such a description contains already the principle of permutability of such transformations , which follows from the following observation  @xcite .
assume the following splitting of the data of the vectorial fundamental transformation @xmath266 associated with the partition @xmath267 , which implies the following splitting of the potentials @xmath268 @xmath269 then the vectorial fundamental transformation is equivalent to the following superposition of vectorial fundamental transformations : + 1 ) transformation @xmath270 with the data @xmath271 , @xmath272 and the corresponding potentials @xmath273 , @xmath274 , @xmath275 @xmath276 2 ) application on the result the vectorial fundamental transformation with the transformed data @xmath277 and potentials @xmath278 i.e. , @xmath279^{-1 } { \boldsymbol{\omega}}(\boldsymbol{y}^b , h)^{\{a\}}.\ ] ]    the same result @xmath280 is obtained exchanging the order of transformations , exchanging also the indices @xmath281 and @xmath282 in formulas - .      in this section
we describe restrictions on the data of the fundamental transformation in order to preserve the reduction from ql to cql . as usually ( see , for example @xcite )
a reduction of the fundamental transformation for a special quadrilateral lattice mimics the geometric properties of the lattice .
because the basic geometric property of the ( scalar ) fundamental transformation can be interpreted as construction of a `` new level '' of the quadrilateral lattice , then it is natural to define the reduced transformation in a similar spirit .
our definition of _ the cql reduction of the fundamental transformation _ is therefore based on the following observation .
[ lem : bql - fund ] given quadrilateral lattice @xmath151 and its fundamental transform @xmath247 constructed under additional assumption that for any point @xmath146 of the lattice and any pair @xmath283 of different directions , the hexahedra with basic vertices @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath148 and @xmath247 satisfy the c - reduction condition .
then both the starting lattice @xmath151 and its transform @xmath284 are c - quadrilateral lattices .    as @xmath285 , by lemma  [ lem :
c - consistency ] we have that also the hexahedra with basic vertices @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath148 and @xmath149 , with @xmath80 distinct , satisfy the c - reduction condition . the similar statement for
the transformed lattice is a consequence of the @xmath120-dimensional consistency of the cql lattice .
the fundamental transform @xmath247 of a c - quadrilateral lattice @xmath151 constructed under additional assumption that for any point @xmath146 of the lattice and any pair @xmath283 of different directions , the hexahedra with basic vertices @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath148 and @xmath247 satisfy the c - reduction condition , is called _ the cql reduction _ of the fundamental transformation .
the following result gives the corresponding restriction of the data of the ( scalar ) fundamental transformation .
[ prop : cql - fund ] let @xmath146 be a c - quadrilateral lattice with rotation coefficients satisfying constraint , and @xmath247 its c - reduced fundamental transform . then there exists a constant @xmath286 such that the data @xmath287 and @xmath288 of the transformation are connected by relation @xmath289    we start from considerations similar to that of proof of proposition  [ prop : q3-cql ] . the idea is to interpret the fundamental transformation as construction of a new level of the quadrilateral lattice .
the potential @xmath290 , called also the combescure vector of the transformation , serves as the normalized tangent vector @xcite , which we denote by @xmath291 , in the transformation direction  @xmath292 ' .
denote by @xmath293 ( @xmath283 are distinct ) the direction vector of the common line of the planes @xmath81 and @xmath294 . it must be therefore decomposed in the basis @xmath84 and in the basis @xmath295 . assuming its decomposition in the second basis we get @xmath296 where we have used the transformation equation .
because the coefficient in front of @xmath291 must vanish , the vector can be therefore chosen as @xmath297    similarly , denote by @xmath298 the direction vector of the intersection line of the plane @xmath299 with @xmath300 .
it must be therefore decomposed in the basis @xmath301 and in the basis @xmath302 . by using equations
and we can choose the vector as @xmath303 because @xmath304 then the c - reduction condition of the @xmath28 , @xmath39 , @xmath292 hexahedron takes the form of equation @xmath305 making use of condition we obtain that @xmath306 then we use lemma [ lem - ry*-y ] , which states that @xmath307 satisfies the same linear problem as @xmath308 does . finally ,
application of the following lemma concludes the proof .    any two scalar solutions @xmath308 and @xmath309 of the linear problem , which satisfy the constraint @xmath310 must be proportional .
assume that none of the solutions is trivial ( then the proportionality constant would be zero ) and define @xmath311 by equation we find @xmath312 which vanishes because of the assumption , therefore @xmath313 may depend on the variable @xmath167 only . inserting then @xmath314 into equation
we obtain @xmath315 , which implies that all the @xmath316 s are equal to the same constant .    in the non - degenerate situation , i.e. @xmath317 ,
which we assume in the sequel , we can put @xmath318 , because ( up to initial value ) @xmath319 , and @xmath320 , and the final result is independent of @xmath286 .      in this section
we study restrictions of the data of the vectorial fundamental transformation , which are compatible with the cql reduction . in that part
we follow the corresponding results of @xcite ( see also proposition 4.9 of @xcite ) .
then we show the corresponding permutability property of the transformation .
given a solution @xmath321 of the adjoint linear problem for the c - quadrilateral lattice whose rotation coefficients satisfy the cql constraint then @xmath322 provides a vectorial solution of the linear problem , and the corresponding potential @xmath323 allows for the following constraint @xmath324 with such a data the transformed lattice @xmath325 given by is c - quadrilateral lattice as well .
in @xcite , instead of relation it was used more general relation @xmath326 where @xmath327 is an arbitrary linear operator .
then also the constraint had to be replaced by @xmath328 which is however equivalent , up to initial data , to due to @xmath329 moreover , because ( up to initial value ) @xmath330 , and @xmath331 the final result is independent of ( non - degenerate ) @xmath327 .
the fundamental vectorial transform given by with the data restricted by conditions and can be considered as the superposition of @xmath265 ( scalar ) discrete cql reduced fundamental transforms .    for @xmath332
we obtain the cql reduction of the fundamental transformation in the setting of proposition  [ prop : cql - fund ] ( with @xmath318 ) . for @xmath333
the statement follows from the standard reasoning applied to superposition of two reduced vectorial fundamental transformations ( compare with @xcite ) .
assume the splitting @xmath334 and the induced splitting @xmath335 of the basic data @xmath336 of the transformation .
then we have also @xmath337 and ( in the shorthand notation , compare equations - ) @xmath338 while the constraint reads @xmath339 by straightforward algebra , using equations , one checks that the transformed data satisfy the cql constraints and as well , i.e. , @xmath340 which concludes the proof .    in the case with matrix @xmath327 as in previous remark , the scalar components of the vectorial transformation do not satisfy ( unless @xmath327 is diagonal ) the cql reduction condition of proposition  [ prop : cql - fund ] .    because the cql - reduced fundamental transformation can be considered as construction of new levels of the c - quadrilateral lattice , then if we denote by @xmath341 the c - quadrilateral lattice obtained by superposition of two ( scalar ) such transforms from @xmath146 to @xmath342 and @xmath343 , then for each direction @xmath28 of the lattice the hexahedra with basic vertices @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath342 and @xmath343 are c - hexahedra .
similarly , if we consider superpositions of three ( scalar ) transforms of the c - quadrilateral lattice @xmath146 then the hexahedra with basic vertices @xmath146 , @xmath342 , @xmath343 and @xmath344 are c - hexahedra .
we presented new geometric interpretation of the discrete ckp equation within the theory of quadrilateral lattices .
the paper should be considered as supplementary to @xcite .
it has been also written in a format similar to @xcite , where we presented novel geometric interpretation of the discrete bkp equation .
results of the paper show once again the fundamental role of the incidence geometry structures in the integrable geometry .
we remark that the integrability of the discrete bkp equations was a consequence of the mbius theorem on mutually inscribed tetrahedrons , and the integrability of the discrete ckp equations was a consequence of the gallucci theorem .
however , it turns out @xcite that both theorems are two diferent faces of a more fundamental result concerning the so called quadrangular sets of points .    in the appendix we present the theory of the darboux maps within the quadrilateral lattice theory thus showing the fundamental role of the quadrilateral lattice in integrable discrete geometry
we would like to present an interpretation of the so called darboux maps @xcite within the quadrilateral lattice theory .
denote by @xmath345 the set of edges of the @xmath346 lattice .
consider a map @xmath347 regarded as a set of @xmath21 maps @xmath348 of edges in @xmath28th direction .
it is termed a discrete darboux map if the four images of the edges of any face of the @xmath346 lattice are collinear , i.e. , there exist functions @xmath349 , @xmath350 , such that @xmath351 compatibility of equations implies @xcite that the functions @xmath352 satisfy the discrete darboux equations .
in order to use the darboux equations in the form the definition of @xmath352 in this paper is shifted with respect to that used in @xcite .
we will briefly demonstrate that the darboux maps can be interpreted as suitably rescaled normalized backward tangent vectors @xmath46 ; compare figure [ fig : back ] with figure [ fig : darboux - map ] , where also the geometric construction of the darboux map is given .
consider the quadrilateral lattice @xmath353 together with its backward tangent vectors @xmath46 and the corresponding backward rotation coefficients @xmath51 .
let @xmath354 be a scalar solution of the backward linear problem @xmath355 define the maps @xmath356 , @xmath357 , @xmath358 then the maps @xmath359 satisfy the darboux map equations @xmath360 with the coefficients @xmath361    by direct verification using the fact that both @xmath46 and @xmath354 satisfy the same linear system .
geometrically , by results of appendix a1 of @xcite , it means that @xmath359 and @xmath362 represent mutual laplace transforms @xcite in the affine gauge , i.e. @xmath359 , @xmath363 , @xmath362 and @xmath364 are collinear and satisfy equation of the form of .
the above result can be reversed , i.e. , any darboux map gives rise via equations and to a system of normalized backward tangent vectors of a quadrilateral lattice .
thus the correspondence between darboux maps and quadrilateral lattices occurs on the geometric linear level .
notice that the functions @xmath354 satisfy the forward adjoint linear problem with the rotation coefficients @xmath51 which satisfy the mql equations . then without any calculation
we infer that the coefficients @xmath365 are solutions of the discrete darboux ( mql ) equations .
finally , we mention that to the vectors @xmath359 it can be given geometric meaning as non - homogeneous coordinates in @xmath75 of the intersections points @xmath366 of the tangent lines to the quadrilateral lattice @xmath0 with the hyperplane at infinity @xmath75 ( see section [ sec : m - cons - cql ] ) . using the pascal hexagon theorem
it can be shown that within this interpretation the `` conic condition '' of @xcite is equivalent to definition [ def : c - hexahedron ] of the c - hexahedron .

"much attention has been paid in recent years to the hard core yukawa ( hcy ) potential as a model for the pair interactions of fluids[1 ] .

worthwhile similar hard - core sutherland potential@xmath0was less investigated . @xmath1 and @xmath2 sign two particles , @xmath3 is their distance , and @xmath4 is interpreted here to be the radius of a hard core .
@xmath5 is a constant . when @xmath6 , this potential is sutherland potential .
it is generally accepted that @xmath7 . in this paper
, we mention out five hypothesis to deal with the total potential energy of a balanced canonical system , on the basis of which we obtain the canonical partition function by integrating under the help of eq.(1 ) .    in section 2 of this paper , the equation of state and the chemical potential are gotten by thermodynamical formulas .
so do their reduced forms .
phase diagrams under five similar hard - core sutherland potentials are illustrated .    in section 3 of this paper , we conclude that there is no proper similar hard - core sutherland potential which can bring completely right interpretation to the balanced liquid - gas coexistence phenomenon by the theory in this paper .
we find that a similar sutherland potential with its exponent @xmath8 leads to more accurate forecast not only to the critical coefficient of argon but also to the phase diagram and the relation of pressure versus temperature .
the case of a balanced argon - like gases canonical system in 3 dimension space is considered firstly .
the average volume @xmath9 of each particle is defined as@xmath10where @xmath11 is the particle number density , @xmath12 is the volume of the system , and @xmath13 is the particle number of the system .
suppose that volume @xmath9 is a three dimensional sphere with its radius @xmath14 .
then we have @xmath15it is natural that @xmath16 .
they are illustrated clearly in fig.(1 ) .
as far as the potential energy is considered , we mention out such hypotheses as    \1 . _ the potential energy _
@xmath17 _ of two particles with their distance _
@xmath3  _ is described by eq.(1 ) .
@xmath18 .
@xmath19 is the total potential energy of the system and is divided to each particle equably .
@xmath20 is called the total potential energy of particle @xmath21 , which benefits from other @xmath22 particles and is the sum of the potential energy contributions of @xmath23 particles to it .
\3 . @xmath24 .
@xmath25 is the potential energy contribution of particle @xmath2 to the total potential energy of particle @xmath1 , and @xmath26 is the potential energy contribution of particle @xmath1 to the total potential energy of particle @xmath2 .
the potential energy @xmath27 is divided to these two particles equably .
when the thermal fluctuation is omitted : @xmath30    @xmath31    when the idea that the total potential energy is divided to each particle equably is accepted , the total potential energy of arbitrary particle @xmath1 keeps the same in the case we discussed .
our case is a balanced argon - like gases canonical system .
when the thermal fluctuation is omitted , we do think that the sum of the potential energy contributions of @xmath23 particles to particle @xmath1 is equal to the potential energy contribution of particle @xmath2 to particle @xmath1 in the universe space of this balanced system .
@xmath32 is the down limit of the integration and @xmath33 is the up limit of the integration .
@xmath34 , @xmath35 .
the down limit is supposed to be _ _
_ _ @xmath14 . and
the up limit is supposed to be @xmath36 . from eq .
( 1 ) , we know that @xmath37 should take the value of @xmath4 , which is the radius of the hard core .
@xmath34 is equal to such an idea that integration @xmath38 .
hence @xmath39 is not taken into account in the calculation of potential .
@xmath40 is illustrated in fig.(1 ) .    from hypotheses ( 1 - 5 )
, we have the result below@xmath41@xmath42we define@xmath43and integrate it as follows@xmath44@xmath45@xmath46@xmath47@xmath48here we applied @xmath16 , @xmath7 .
the hamiltonian @xmath49 reads@xmath50where @xmath51 is the mass of one particle , @xmath52 is the momentum of particle @xmath21 .
thus canonical partition function can be solved as@xmath53with @xmath54 , @xmath55 plank constant .
we calculate eq.(9 ) as follows@xmath56@xmath57with thermal wavelength @xmath58 , @xmath59 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath60 is called position partition function normally .
inputting eq.(5 ) to eq.(10 ) , we get@xmath61@xmath62@xmath63@xmath64@xmath65@xmath66@xmath67with  @xmath68 @xmath69 and @xmath70 is the free volume .
@xmath11 * *  * * _ is the particle number density which keeps conservation when a balanced canonical system is considered . _  and we do not consider the fluctuation of @xmath11 in this paper .
for the existence of the radius @xmath4 of the hard core , each particle excludes a volume @xmath71 and hence for @xmath13 particles the excluded volume is @xmath72 the free volume , therefor @xmath73 with @xmath74 .
thus eq . (
11 ) reads    @xmath75      we can get the equation of state as follows @xmath76@xmath77when we choose @xmath78 , the equation of state is written as@xmath79this is just the form of the vdw equation of state .
here we sign the pressure of the gases @xmath80 , the pressure of the liquids @xmath81 , the chemical potential of the gases @xmath82 , the chemical potential of the liquids @xmath83 , the critical temperature @xmath84 , the critical pressure @xmath85 , the critical particle number density @xmath86,the particle number density of the gases @xmath87 , the particle number density of the liquids @xmath88 , the reduced temperature @xmath89 , the reduced particle number density of the gases @xmath90 , the reduced particle number density of the liquids @xmath91 the reduced  pressure of the gases @xmath92,the reduced  pressure of the liquids @xmath93 the particle number of the gases @xmath94 , the particle number of the liquids @xmath95 , the volume of the gases @xmath96 , and the volume of the liquids @xmath97 .
the relations between them are@xmath98@xmath99@xmath100@xmath101@xmath102@xmath103@xmath104at critical point , the function @xmath105 has such qualities as    @xmath106    @xmath107    thus we get the critical data by solving eq.(22 ) and eq.(23 ) .
they are@xmath108@xmath109@xmath110@xmath111when @xmath78 , they read@xmath112@xmath113@xmath114@xmath115we are very familiar with these results which are just the reduced data from the vdw equation of state .
@xmath116 is the critical coefficient .
when @xmath117 , @xmath118    inputting eq.(24 - 26 ) to eq.(13 ) , we get the reduced equation of state@xmath119      here we can solve the chemical potential as follows@xmath120@xmath121inputting eq.(24 - 26 ) to eq.(33 ) , we get the critical chemical potential . then the reduced chemical potential is calculated to be@xmath122where @xmath123 , @xmath124 and @xmath125 are given by@xmath126 , \]]@xmath127 , \]]@xmath128 .\ ] ]      we consider the case of the balanced liquid - gas coexistence canonical argon - like system in 3 dimensional space , which is a unit - two phases system .
here we do think the two phases are described by the same canonical partition function as eq.(12 ) .
there are three balanced conditions which must be satisfied when these two phases are balanced .
they are thermal condition@xmath129dynamic condition@xmath130and phase condition    @xmath131    for eq.(15 - 21 ) , these three conditions can be expressed in the reduced unit as@xmath132@xmath133@xmath134from eq.(32 ) , we have    @xmath135    @xmath136    from eq.(34 ) , we have@xmath137@xmath138the solution of eq.(41 ) and eq.(42 ) is@xmath139the solution of eq.(41 ) and eq.(43 ) is@xmath140 } .\]]thus we get a function @xmath141 easily from eq.(48 ) and eq.(49).@xmath142@xmath143 } .\]]if @xmath144 is chosen to be a constant , @xmath145 can be gotten in the way of numerical computation by computer when an arbitrary @xmath146 is fixed .
then @xmath89 is obtained easily from eq.(48 ) or eq.(49 ) . and
@xmath147 is solved by eq.(32 ) .
table.(1 ) is the theoretic data when @xmath148 .
fig.(2 ) is the correlation of @xmath90 and @xmath149 under different similar hard - core sutherland potentials signed by different @xmath144 .
fig.(3 ) is the phase diagrams corresponding with different @xmath144 .
fig.(4 ) is the curve of @xmath150 versus @xmath151 . in ref.[4
] , we have introduced one method called polynomial approximation to simulate the relation of two variables .
here we can get the relation of @xmath150 versus @xmath152 by this method when @xmath153 is fixed . in ref.[5 ] , the theoretic relation of @xmath150 versus @xmath151 was given by this method in the case of @xmath78 .    in 1945 , e.a.guggenheim collected the data of the balanced liquid - gas coexistence system from experiments and gave out the correlation of @xmath154 , @xmath155 and @xmath89 by the empirical equations[5,6 ] below@xmath156@xmath157for that@xmath158@xmath159we have@xmath160@xmath161 in eq.(51 - 52 ) , @xmath162 is the reduced density of the gases and @xmath163 is the reduced density of the liquids .
as far as argon system is concerned , the inaccuracy of these two equations is generally only one or two parts per thousand of @xmath155 or of @xmath164 when @xmath165[5,6 ] .
so , it is acceptable to consider the data of @xmath166 from eq.(55 - 56 ) as the experimental ones in this temperature region[5 ] .
e.a.guggenheim gave a numerical analytic result of the relation between the reduced temperature and the reduced pressure from experiments by equation[5,7]@xmath167which best fits the experimental data for argon when @xmath165 except a tiny region near the critical point[5,7 ] .
thus it is acceptable to consider the data of @xmath168 from eq.(57 ) as the experimental ones , too[5 ] . the data from eq.(55 - 57 )
are illustrated as experimental data in fig.(2 - 4 ) and table.(2 ) to compare with the theoretic ones deduced above .
in this paper we advanced five hypothesis to deal with the total potential energy of a balanced canonical system .
hypothesis 1 - 4 are easy to be accepted .
the key is hypothesis 5 .
actually @xmath34 , @xmath35 is a simple approximation to a concrete sytem . in labs ,
the volume of the sytem we consider is finite:@xmath169 additionally , only when we consider a static sytem in 3 dimensional space , can the average volume of a particle be regarded as a sphere . and
@xmath14 is effective .
@xmath34 is only a simple effective approximation .    on the basis of the five hypothesis
, we got the canonical partition function eq.(12 ) .
thus all the thermodynamic quantities will be solved by eq.(12 ) .
following , we analyzed the balanced liquid - gas coexistence canonical argon - like system .
the results are partly illustrated in figures and tables .
fig.(3 - 4 ) indicates that @xmath144 in the region ( 0,1 ) leads to more perfect forecast to experimental data .
applying numerical calculation by computer , we find @xmath170 is the best among the five values of @xmath144 chosen in this paper only when phase diagram and the relation of @xmath150 versus @xmath152 are considered together .
it is clearly illustrated in figure.(3 - 4 ) .
then the similar hard - core sutherland potential is fixed to be the form of@xmath171 in this case , the equation of state is @xmath172now the critical coefficient @xmath116 is equal to @xmath173 . but @xmath170 is not the best when the relation of @xmath90 versus @xmath145 is considered .
figure.(2 ) suggests that @xmath174 and @xmath175 are better .
now we will ask whether a proper @xmath144 , which can bring completely right forecast to experiments when the liquid - gas coexistence phenomenon is considered , exisits or not by the theory in this paper .
suppose that such a @xmath176 exists .
thus eq.(50 ) will be right when arbitrary two experimental data terms @xmath177 are considered . from eq.(55 - 56 )
, we get two experimental data terms:@xmath178 , latexmath:[$\left ( 0.3928,1.6822\right )    value of @xmath144 by matlab software .
the result is @xmath180 thus we conclude such a proper @xmath144 does not exist .
but it does not mean that there exists no value for @xmath144 corresponding with the potential explaining the experimental data properly .
a new theory may be do .
actually , when the liquid - gas phase transiton to second order is considered , our work does not work well for the obvious fluctuation near to the critical point , which is ommitted in hypothesis ( 4 ) .
we will discuss it in details in future work .
of course , we see that this work offered the proper critical coefficient @xmath181 of argon by a simple equation of state with @xmath182 .

"high resolution spectra of h  i ly@xmath0 lines from the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) have proven to be useful for many purposes .
hydrogen and deuterium atoms in the interstellar medium produce absorption features in stellar ly@xmath0 spectra that can be analyzed to yield information about the ism . of particular interest
are measurements of the local deuterium - to - hydrogen ( d / h ) ratio , which has been a focal point for these analyses in the past due to its relevance for cosmology and galactic chemical evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?
* ; * ? ? ?
* ; * ? ? ?
* ; * ? ? ?
* ; * ? ? ?
in addition to the ism absorption , some of the ly@xmath0 spectra of nearby stars also show absorption from the outer heliosphere and/or absorption from the analogous `` astrospheres '' surrounding the observed stars @xcite .
the region of the outer heliosphere that is probed by the heliospheric absorption is not observable by any other means .
astrospheres and the solar - like stellar winds that are implied by their presence are also otherwise completely undetectable .
thus , the heliospheric and astrospheric diagnostics provided by the hst ly@xmath0 absorption spectra are truly unique .
@xcite provides a complete review of past results concerning the analysis of the heliospheric and astrospheric absorption .
the most important quantitative results from the astrospheric ly@xmath0 absorption analyses are the first measurements of mass loss rates for solar - like stars , although they could also in principle be used as ism diagnostics @xcite . collectively , these measurements suggest that mass loss increases with magnetic activity and decreases with stellar age , suggesting that the solar wind was stronger in the past @xcite .
in addition to its obvious importance for solar / stellar astronomy , the implied stronger wind of the young sun could have important ramifications for our understanding of the evolution of planetary atmospheres in our solar system .
however , the inferred mass - loss / activity and mass - loss / age relations for cool main sequence stars are based on only six astrospheric detections .
many more detections are necessary to confirm and refine these results .    motivated primarily by the need to increase the number of astrospheric detections , we have searched the hst archive for additional ly@xmath0 spectra of nearby cool stars .
we find 33 new data sets to analyze .
in addition to identifying lines of sight with detectable astrospheric absorption , we also analyze these data for other purposes : ( 1 ) to search for heliospheric ly@xmath0 absorption , ( 2 ) to measure ism h  i column densities , and ( 3 ) to measure chromospheric ly@xmath0 fluxes corrected for ism , heliospheric , and astrospheric absorption . by combining our results with previous measurements ,
we ultimately provide here a complete list of ly@xmath0 measurements based on high resolution hst spectra of nearby cool stars , and we discuss some implications of these results .
in the top section of table  1 , we list 29 lines of sight with hst ly@xmath0 spectra that have been analyzed and published .
( see the references listed in the last column of the table . ) except for 36  oph  a , all these spectra were taken by the goddard high resolution spectrograph ( ghrs ) instrument .
the 36  oph  a spectrum was taken by the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) , which replaced the ghrs on hst in 1997 .
the eighth column of table  1 lists the ism h  i column densities ( in @xmath3 ) measured towards the observed stars .
the ninth column indicates whether high resolution hst spectra of the interstellar mg  ii h & k absorption lines ( at 2803    and 2796   , respectively ) are available to provide information on the velocity structure of the ism .
when available , this information is always taken into account in the analysis of the broad , saturated ism ly@xmath0 absorption , which increases confidence in the results of the complex ly@xmath0 analysis .
note that only the highest resolution gratings of the ghrs and stis instruments , with @xmath4 , can resolve the narrow mg  ii absorption lines , so column  8 of table  1 does not acknowledge the presence of low ( @xmath5 ) or moderate ( @xmath6 ) resolution spectra of mg  ii in the hst archive .
the tenth and eleventh columns of table  1 indicate which ly@xmath0 spectra show the presence of heliospheric absorption and astrospheric absorption , in addition to the ism absorption .
marginal detections are indicated by question marks . whether a detection is marginal or not is based on our own determination , after inspecting and working with the data ourselves . @xcite and @xcite
find evidence for weak heliospheric absorption towards the similar capella and g191-b2b lines of sight , but these claims rely on subtle statistical arguments rather than clearly visible excess absorption , so we do not consider these to be detections for our purposes here .    for eight of the stars in table  1 , the tenth and eleventh columns are left blank because the ly@xmath0 spectra are moderate resolution ghrs spectra , which generally lack sufficient spectral resolution to allow a clear detection of heliospheric or astrospheric absorption .
the exception is sirius , which shows detectable heliospheric absorption in its moderate resolution ghrs spectrum @xcite .
this detection owes its success in large part to the extremely low ism h  i column density for that line of sight , which minimizes the ism absorption and makes the heliospheric absorption easier to detect .
nearly all of the stars listed in table  1 are cool stars , but there are a few exceptions : sirius , hz  43 , g191-b2b , feige  24 , and gd  246 .
these stars will not have solar - like astrospheres around them since they do not have solar - like winds .
for this reason , column 11 is left blank for these stars .
our goal here is to find additional ly@xmath0 spectra lurking in the hst archive to provide new measurements of ism absorption , and hopefully new detections of heliospheric and astrospheric absorption .
we confine our attention to lines of sight shorter than 100  pc .
longer lines of sight will almost certainly have ism h  i column densities too high and ism ly@xmath0 absorption too broad to hope to detect any heliospheric or astrospheric absorption .
we also restrict ourselves to observations of cool stars of spectral type f and later , which will presumably have coronal winds analogous to that of the sun and will therefore potentially have detectable astrospheres analogous to the sun s heliosphere .
finally , the ly@xmath0 spectra must have sufficient spectral resolution to allow for a reasonably confident identification of heliospheric and astrospheric absorption , if present .
ideally , this means high resolution spectra with either the ghrs ech - a grating or the stis e140h grating , which are both capable of fully resolving the h  i and d  i ly@xmath0 absorption line profiles .
unfortunately , all the ech - a and e140h data that fit our criteria have already been analyzed and are listed in the top section of table  1 . as mentioned above , the @xmath6 moderate resolution ghrs spectra do not generally have sufficient spectral resolution for our purposes . in order to clearly identify the presence of heliospheric and astrospheric absorption , which is
always highly blended with the ism absorption , it is necessary to use the information provided by the ism d  i absorption profile to constrain the ism h  i absorption , so resolving d  i is crucial ( see  4.2 ) .    although moderate resolution ghrs spectra do not meet our resolution requirements , moderate resolution stis spectra with the e140 m grating _ are _ acceptable .
the stis e140 m spectra have @xmath7 , which is sufficient to mostly resolve the d  i absorption profile .
furthermore , stis e140 m spectra cover a wide wavelength range of 11501730   , meaning that there are many e140 m spectra in the hst archive taken to observe different emission lines within e140 m s broad spectral range that will nevertheless also include the ly@xmath0 line at 1216    in which we are interested .
we have searched the hst archive for previously unanalyzed stis e140 m spectra of cool stars within 100  pc , and in the bottom portion of table  1 we list the 33 lines of sight observed by hst that meet these criteria .
all observations except those of @xmath1  boo  a and 61  vir were performed through the @xmath8 aperture . the @xmath1  boo  a and 61  vir data were obtained through the narrower @xmath9 aperture .
the data were reduced using the stis team s calstis software package written in idl @xcite .
the processing includes wavelength calibration using spectra of the calibration lamp taken during the observations , and includes correction for scattered light .
we generally coadd all available e140 m spectra in the archive , with two exceptions . for ad leo
, there are separate data sets on 2000 march 10 and 2002 june 1 .
we choose not to include the latter because the geocoronal ly@xmath0 emission is difficult to remove in those data .
( see  3 for more discussion about the geocoronal emission and its removal . ) for v471  tau , there are three different large data sets . for the sake of simplicity , we choose to reduce only the observations taken on 2000 august 2427 .
figure  1 shows the final processed spectra of all 33 stars , focusing on the ly@xmath0 region .
each spectrum shows a stellar emission line upon which is superimposed a very broad h  i ly@xmath0 absorption feature centered near the rest wavelength of 1215.670   .
the spectra also show narrow d  i ly@xmath0 absorption about @xmath10    from the center of the h  i absorption , except in cases where the h  i absorption is broad enough to obscure the d  i absorption ( see  4.2 ) .
finally , the spectra are contaminated by h  i ly@xmath0 emission from the earth s geocorona , which is shaded in figure  1 .
these geocoronal lines are narrow , and most are conveniently contained within the saturated core of the ism h  i absorption , allowing them to be easily removed . in such cases ,
we remove the geocoronal lines by fitting gaussians to the lines and then subtracting the gaussians from the data . note that the hd  209458 spectrum is the sum of spectra taken at two different times when the geocoronal emission was at different wavelengths , so two gaussians are fitted to the data in this case .    in some cases
the geocoronal emission is blended with the sides of the h  i absorption profile , making the geocoronal subtraction significantly harder and more uncertain ( e.g. , hd  73350 ) . in such instances ,
we still use gaussian fitting to estimate the absorption , but we only fit the side of the emission close to the absorption core and we force the fitted gaussian to be at the expected wavelength , which we know to within about 2 km  s@xmath11 based on the accuracy of the wavelength calibration ( see below ) . nevertheless , the uncertainty in the geocoronal subtraction for these blended cases could be a significant source of systematic error in the analysis of the h  i absorption lines . in all future figures , ly@xmath0 spectra will be shown with the geocoronal emission removed .
although the geocoronal emission is an annoyance when it is blended with the sides of the absorption profile , its presence is actually beneficial when it is fully within the absorption core , because it can be used as a secondary wavelength calibrator .
the data reduction places the spectra in a heliocentric rest frame , which means that the geocoronal emission is centered at the projected velocity of the earth towards the star at the time of observation .
this quantity is known accurately and can be compared with the measured center of the emission , in order to test the wavelength scale . in figure  2
, we plot the velocity discrepancies of the geocoronal emission from their expected locations ( @xmath12 ) for all the newly analyzed stars .
these are all stis e140 m spectra , so this represents an excellent test of the stis e140 m wavelength calibration .
the weighted mean and standard deviation of the data points in figure  2 is @xmath13 km  s@xmath11 .
this result suggests that calstis - processed e140 m spectra are systematically blueshifted by 1.2 km  s@xmath11 from where they should be , at least in the ly@xmath0 spectral region .
the standard calstis data reduction computes a global wavelength offset for the entire stis spectrum from the wavelength calibration images .
perhaps the ly@xmath0 spectral region , which is near the edge of the e140 m grating s spectral coverage , is systematically shifted from the average offset value .
there are also a few individual spectra that show significant discrepancies of up to 4 km  s@xmath11 from the average @xmath14 value
. whatever the cause of the systematic wavelength shift and the scatter around it , we believe that the geocoronal lines provide a better velocity scale , so for all spectra in which a geocoronal emission centroid can be measured , we correct the wavelengths of our spectra using the @xmath14 values in figure  2 .
the d  i ly@xmath0 absorption lines are relatively easy to analyze by themselves .
because they are narrow , a reasonably accurate continuum can be interpolated over these lines and an absorption profile can then be fitted to the d  i lines .
@xcite have already performed these measurements for some of the stars in our sample .
figure  3 shows examples of some of the d  i fits .
the thin solid line shows the assumed background continuum , the dotted lines show the individual absorption components of the fit , and the thick solid line shows the combination of all the components after convolution with the instrumental line spread function ( lsf ) .
the stis e140 m lsf used here is from @xcite .
analyzing the h  i ly@xmath0 absorption is much trickier .
not only is the visible absorption broad and difficult to interpolate over , but ism h  i column densities towards even the nearest stars are high enough for the h  i absorption profile to have extended damping wings .
thus , analyzing the h  i absorption essentially requires first reconstructing the entire stellar ly@xmath0 profile .
this can be done as follows .
the first step is to use a fit to the d  i absorption to infer what the central wavelength and doppler broadening parameter should be for the h  i line .
the ism h  i absorption should presumably have the same centroid velocity as d  i , so @xmath15 , and since past work has demonstrated that h  i and d  i absorption lines in the local ism are dominated by thermal broadening ( e.g. , * ? ? ?
* ; * ? ? ?
* ) , their doppler parameters are related by @xmath16 . with this information , an h  i opacity profile , @xmath17 ( assumed to be a voigt profile ) ,
can be computed for various assumed values of the h  i column density , @xmath18 . for each opacity profile
, we can then reconstruct the wings of the stellar emission line profile by multiplying the data by @xmath19 .
( note that since we are interested in modeling the damping wings rather than the central part of the absorption , the assumed value of @xmath20 is actually unimportant . )    figure  4 shows the results of this exercise using the @xmath1  boo data as an example , with the d  i absorption having been removed .
stellar line profiles are reconstructed assuming ism h  i column densities in the range @xmath21 ( units @xmath3 ) . only the wings of the profile outside the dashed lines
are reconstructed using the opacity profiles computed as described above . in order to estimate the profile in between the dashed lines , we either use a polynomial fit to the wings to interolate between them , or more commonly we use the mg  ii h & k lines to estimate the shape of the central portion of the ly@xmath0 profile .
the justification for this is that ly@xmath0 and the two mg  ii lines are all highly optically thick chromospheric lines that have similar profiles in the solar spectrum @xcite .
table  1 indicates which hst data sets include high resolution mg  ii spectra .
if high resolution mg  ii spectra are not available for a star , we often use the mg  ii profile of a similar star .
( the @xmath1  boo  a mg  ii profiles are the most commonly used surrogates . )      the profile reconstruction technique described in  4.1 results in a family of stellar ly@xmath0 profiles , as in figure  4 , each of which can be used as a starting point for an analysis of the h  i absorption . with each assumed profile , an initial h  i+d  i absorption fit is performed , which is done using a @xmath22 minimization technique @xcite .
all necessary atomic data for the d  i and h  i ly@xmath0 lines are taken from @xcite .
the absorption is convolved with the lsf before comparing with the data , as in the d  i fits in figure  3 . in all our fits involving h  i absorption , we fit h  i and d  i simultaneously and constrain the problem by forcing @xmath15 and @xmath23 . after the initial fit , the assumed stellar profile
is then altered based on the residuals of the fit , and then a second , presumably improved absorption line fit is performed .
additional iterations can be done to further refine the fit . for a simple line of sight with one ism absorption component and no heliospheric or astrospheric absorption ,
the problem is well constrained enough that this iterative process ultimately ends up driving the fit parameters of the single absorption component towards the same solution _ no matter which of the assumed stellar profiles one actually starts out with .
_ however , this is not always the case in more complicated multi - component lines of sight , especially when heliospheric or astrospheric absorption is present ( see * ? ? ?
fortunately , it is possible to constrain the analysis even further by assuming a d / h ratio . using uv spectra from hst and the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _ ( fuse ) , a consensus has been reached that the interstellar d / h ratio is invariable within the local bubble .
based on different compilations of measurements , @xcite finds @xmath24 , @xcite quotes @xmath25 , and @xcite computes @xmath26 , with no evidence for significant variation within 100  pc .
since all our targets are located within the local bubble , we simply assume @xmath27 , consistent with the values quoted above . with the addition of this assumption , all three fit parameters of the difficult - to - analyze h  i absorption [ @xmath28 , @xmath20 , and @xmath18 ] are dependent on the much better constrained d
i fit parameters [ @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 .
the ism h  i absorption profile is therefore much more tightly constrained , even when multiple ism components are included .
this assumption also means that we do not have to experiment with all the stellar profiles reconstructed as in figure  4 .
we can instead immediately focus on the profile that was constructed assuming the @xmath18 value that the d  i fit suggests should yield @xmath27 . in the case of @xmath1  boo  a that value is @xmath33 , and this profile is emphasized in figure  4 . not having to consider the other profiles as possible starting points for the h  i absorption analysis greatly simplifies what would otherwise be a formidable and time - consuming problem considering the number of spectra that we wish to analyze .    in order to provide the reader with an idea of how h  i+d  i absorption profiles vary under the constraints described above , figure 5
shows profiles computed for a range of column densities , @xmath34 , and for two different doppler parameters , @xmath35 km  s@xmath11 and @xmath36 km  s@xmath11 . with only a few exceptions ,
the range of column densities covers the values observed for the @xmath37 lines of sight listed in table  1 .
the two doppler parameters represent temperatures of @xmath38  k and @xmath39  k , respectively ( in the absence of nonthermal broadening ) , which roughly define the range of temperatures that are generally observed in the local ism ( see  4.4 ) .    in figure 5 ,
the d  i line is clearly narrower for the lower @xmath40 value , and at low column densities the doppler core of the h  i absorption is also narrower , but the far damping wings of the h  i absorption are only dependent on the column density . at the highest column densities shown
, the doppler core of the h  i absorption has been obliterated by the broadening absorption from the damping wings , so nearly all dependence on @xmath40 is lost .
by @xmath41 , the d  i absorption has become saturated and almost completely blended with h  i. thus , the d  i line is no longer very useful for constraining @xmath18 via the @xmath27 assumption .
however , the width of the base of the h  i absorption has become much more sensitive to @xmath18 , so a reasonably accurate h  i column density can still be measured in this high column regime .    the ism velocity structure along a line of sight is something that we take into account in our ly@xmath0 fits , when this information is available .
unfortunately , the thermal width of the d  i line is too large to suggest the presence of any but the most widely separated ism components , and the h  i absorption is naturally far too broad and opaque for these purposes .
the ism mg  ii h & k absorption lines are the most commonly used lines for studying the velocity structure of the local ism , although weaker fe  ii lines observable in near - uv spectra can be useful as well .
the large atomic weights of the mg  ii and fe  ii species mean that the thermal broadening of their ism absorption lines is much lower than for d  i and h  i. in fact , these lines are typically dominated by nonthermal rather than thermal broadening .
thus , when observed at the highest spectral resolution accessible to ghrs or stis , the very narrow mg  ii and fe  ii lines are ideal for indentifying multiple ism velocity components .
table  1 indicates which of our lines of sight have high resolution mg  ii data that can be used to infer the ism velocity structure .
* hereafter rl02 ) have already analyzed these and other data to provide a complete survey of observed ism mg  ii and fe  ii absorption for lines of sight within 100  pc . in cases where multiple ism components are seen
, we use the results of rl02 to constrain multi - component fits to our ly@xmath0 data . in a multi - component ly@xmath0
fit we force the velocity separations of the components to be the same as those seen for mg  ii .
we do not fix the velocities themselves in order to allow the fit to account for possible differences in the wavelength calibrations of the mg  ii and ly@xmath0 spectra , so we allow one component centroid to vary and force the other components to have the appropriate shifts from that component . because the ism components are so highly blended in the broad h  i and d  i lines , our philosophy is to initially assume as many constraints as possible .
thus , initially we force all components to have the same doppler parameter in our fits ( though we do not force a particular value ) , and we also assume that the column density ratios of the individual components are the same as found for mg  ii . if a reasonable fit to the data can not be obtained with these constraints we try relaxing them , the justification being that warm , neutral material within the local bubble is not entirely homogeneous . temperatures and dust depletions within the local ism vary to some extent , resulting in variations in doppler parameters and mg  ii / h  i column density ratios @xcite .
however , all components are always constrained by the deuterium - hydrogen self - consistency requirements described above
.    note that throughout this paper , the `` reasonableness '' of a fit is ultimately assessed by eye .
the fitting process includes the tweaking of the assumed stellar emission profile to maximize the quality of a fit ( see above ) . since this tweaking is not automated , the final value of @xmath22 is in large part dependent on our ability to alter the ly@xmath0 profile in a reasonable fashion .
this ability is imprecise and hard to quantify , so the final value of @xmath22 is of limited usefulness in assessing whether a fit is acceptable , or whether it is necessary to relax certain assumptions in order to obtain a better fit .
thus , we ultimately rely on our own subjective judgment rather than using a certain @xmath22 threshold or some other statistical test .    for 25 of the 33 lines of sight , we are able to adequately fit the ly@xmath0 spectra with only ism absorption .
the resulting fits are shown in figure  6 along with the reconstructed stellar ly@xmath0 profiles . only the total ism absorption is shown in figure  6 .
for the multi - component fits , figure  3 provides an idea of what the absorption contributions from the individual components are like .
( although the figure  3 fits are d  i - only fits , the h  i+d  i fits in figure  6 will not be very different in how they fit the d  i line due to the constraints described above that are imposed on these fits . )    table  2 lists the parameters of these fits , using the i d numbers assigned in table  1 to identify the stars .
the quoted 1@xmath42 uncertainties indicate only the random errors induced in the fits by the noise of the spectra .
there is no attempt to include systematic errors such as those associated with the shape of the assumed stellar line profile , which surely dominate the uncertainty in the analysis .    for the h  i column densities , which are of particular interest for ism studies ,
systematic errors include uncertainties in the assumed d / h value , keeping in mind that for most of our lines of sight the dominant constraint on @xmath18 is @xmath43 .
the uncertainties in the average local bubble d / h values quoted near the beginning of this section are @xmath44% .
when combined with uncertainties related to the reconstructed stellar line profile and the ism velocity structure , we believe that typical uncertainties in the _ total _
h  i column densities listed in table  1 are @xmath45% , or about 0.04 dex in @xmath46 .
( see the notes on the @xmath1  boo analysis in  4.5 for discussion on how such errors might affect detection of heliospheric and astrospheric absorption . ) however , in cases where a good d  i profile is not present in the data , either due to poor s /
n or a high column density that leads to d  i being saturated and blended with h  i ( e.g. , hd  203244 , hd  106516 , hd  128987 , hd  28568 , hd  28205 , hd  28033 , hd  209458 , and @xmath47  cap ) , systematic uncertainties in the @xmath46 values listed in table  1 are probably more like @xmath48  dex .    it should be noted that in multi - component cases , the total h  i column density along a line of sight will be known better than the column densities of the individual components , which are listed in table  2 , because the components are so highly blended that the component h  i column densities will be highly dependent on the assumptions made about the components described above . thus , systematic errors for the @xmath46 values listed in table  2 for the individual components will be even higher than those estimated above for the total h  i column densities . for the multi - component fits , the component numbers listed in table  2 are the same numbers as those used by rl02 . the last column of table  2 indicates which lines of sight are discussed in more detail in  4.5 .
there are three different velocities listed in table  2 that can be compared with the measured ism velocity , @xmath28 : @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 . the @xmath49 quantity indicates the line - of - sight velocity predicted by the local interstellar cloud ( lic ) vector @xcite , which is pointed towards galactic coordinates [ @xmath52 , @xmath53 with a magnitude of 25.7 km  s@xmath11 .
this agrees well with measurements of ism particles moving through the solar system , which suggest a flow directed at coordinates [ @xmath54 , @xmath55 at a speed of 26.3 km  s@xmath11 @xcite .
however , for lines of sight near the galactic center direction , the so - called g cloud vector of @xcite can be a better predictor of ism absorption line velocities , so the @xmath50 quantity indicates the velocities suggested by this vector . a sky map from @xcite
provides a crude estimate of the region on the sky where the g cloud vector is applicable , which suggests that the g cloud vector is most likely to apply for stars 33 , 39 , 45 , 46 , and 52 .
it is worth noting that it is very questionable whether the g cloud is truly distinct from the lic and other nearby clouds , or if the apparent different velocity vector in that direction is merely a product of complex velocity gradients within local ism material @xcite . despite this ambiguity ,
the g cloud vector is still useful for our purposes as a predictor of ism velocities in directions where the lic vector clearly does not work .
finally , for lines of sight that have mg  ii measurements , we also list in table  2 the mg  ii velocities from rl02 , @xmath51 , although for @xmath56  peg and @xmath47  cap we choose to quote the fe  ii velocities instead ( see  4.5 ) .
the null assumption in all our ly@xmath0 analyses is that there is no heliospheric or astrospheric absorption present .
we make every effort to find a reasonable fit to the h  i+d  i ly@xmath0 absorption assuming the presence of only ism absorption .
however , for 8 of our 33 lines of sight we conclude that there is simply no way that the d  i and h  i absorption can be fitted in a self - consistent manner without including additional h  i absorption beyond that from the ism .
the additional h  i absorption component must have a column density too low [ @xmath57 ) ] to produce any absorption in lines from much less abundant species such as d  i , mg  ii , or fe  ii .
it is this excess h  i absorption that we interpret as being from the heliosphere or from the astrospheres surrounding the observed stars .    in our fits to these data in figure  7 , we add a single absorption component to the analysis to represent heliospheric and/or astrospheric absorption .
this component is labeled as `` hs / as '' in table  2 , where the final fit parameters are listed for all our ly@xmath0 fits . in figure  7 , we show the absorption provided only by the ism , the discrepancy with the data indicating the excess absorption that we believe must be coming from hs / as absorption .
past theoretical work has shown that the heliosphere only produces excess absorption on the red side of the ly@xmath0 absorption line , while astrospheric absorption produces excess absorption on the blue side of the line @xcite .
the redshift of heliospheric absorption relative to the ism is mostly due to the deceleration and deflection of h atoms as they cross the bow shock , whereas the corresponding effect for astrospheres results instead in a blueshift since our perspective is from outside the astrosphere rather than inside .
thus , based on the fits in figure  7 , we report and list in table  1 the following new astrospheric absorption detections : ev  lac , 70  oph , @xmath1  boo , 61  vir , @xmath2  eri , hd  128987 , and dk  uma . however , we consider the 61  vir and dk  uma detections to be marginal ( see  4.5 ) .
the new heliospheric absorption detections are : 70  oph , @xmath1  boo , 61  vir , and hd  165185 .
details about the evidence for the presence of the hs / as absorption will be provided in  4.5 for each individual line of sight , but some general comments can be made here .
the most important one is that it is impossible to overstate the importance of the constraints on the ism h  i absorption provided by the d  i absorption . in cases where only heliospheric _ or _ astrospheric absorption is present ( ev  lac , @xmath2  eri , hd  165185 , hd  128987 , and dk  uma ) , the hs /
as absorption produces a significant shift of the h  i absorption centroid away from that suggested by the d  i absorption ( see fig .
if multiple ism components are present , one can try to account for this by allowing the ism components to have different doppler parameters .
given the saturated nature of the h  i absorption , increasing @xmath20 for one component can significantly increase the absorption in this component relative to the others , whereas this will not be the case for the unsaturated d  i line , which is far more affected by the relative column densities of the components than by their relative @xmath31 values .
multiple ism components can therefore in principle induce an apparent shift of the h  i absorption relative to d  i. however , because the ism absorption components are always so highly blended , and because of the stringent deuterium - hydrogen self - consistency constraints described in  4.2 , the relative velocity shift that can be induced in this fashion without resulting in poor fits to either d  i or h  i is limited .    a second source of evidence for hs / as absorption , especially important in cases where _ both _ heliospheric and astrospheric absorption are present ( 70  oph , @xmath1  boo , and 61  vir ) , is the overall width of the base of the h  i absorption . the presence of hs / as absorption makes this width larger than can be explained by ism absorption alone ( see fig .
7 ) . in the h  i column density regime of concern here
, one can try to broaden an ism h  i component either by increasing @xmath20 or @xmath18 .
however the @xmath27 constraint means that it is not possible to greatly increase @xmath18 without producing too much d  i absorption , and the @xmath23 constraint means that increasing @xmath20 too much will eventually make the d  i absorption too broad .    in principle , the stellar ly@xmath0 profiles can be altered to account for the excess hs / as absorption in figure  7 , but this does not work in practice since the alterations necessary to remove the need for the hs / as absorption yield profiles that are completely implausible @xcite .
using @xmath2  eri as an example , changing the stellar profile to fit the data without requiring the existence of the excess h  i absorption seen in figure  7 necessitates the assumption of a profile that decreases from about where it is in figure  7 at 1215.45  (@xmath58 ergs @xmath3
s@xmath11 @xmath11 ) down to zero flux at about 1215.57   .
this is not a reasonable stellar profile .
reasonable alterations to stellar profiles do not include the introduction of extreme profile slopes or zero flux within the emission profile .
note that although we list the parameters for the hs / as components in table  2 for completeness , they are of little use in estimating properties of the heliospheric and/or astrospheric gas . more sophisticated analyses of this excess absorption using hydrodynamic modeling of the heliosphere and astrospheres is required to extract meaningful quantitative information from the heliospheric and astrospheric absorption @xcite , which will be done in a future paper .
we do not bother using separate heliospheric and astrospheric absorption components even when both are clearly present , partly because of the limited usefulness of the fit parameters of these empirical absorption components , and partly because our goal here is simply to infer the presence of the hs / as absorption and illustrate the amount of excess absorption in figure  7 .
the fit parameters listed for the ism absorption components in table  2 provide useful diagnostics for the local ism .
the column densities indicate the average ism h  i densities along the lines of sight when divided by the target distances , the velocities provide information on the ism flow vector , and the doppler parameters indicate the temperature of the gas , which can be estimated by the equation @xmath59 if the small contributions of turbulent velocities to the line broadening are neglected @xcite .
however , interpreting the meaning of these measurements is somewhat problematic unless the velocity structure is known .
the high resolution mg  ii and fe  ii spectra that provide this information are only available for 12 of our 33 lines of sight . since 7 of these 12 sight lines show multiple ism components ,
the prevalence of multiple velocity components is clear .
the presence of unresolved velocity structure can shift the centroid of the ism absorption away from the expected @xmath49 or @xmath50 values , and it can also broaden the absorption lines , thereby artificially increasing the d  i and h  i doppler parameters .    of the 12 lines of sight with mg  ii and/or fe  ii information ,
all but one show an absorption component within 3 km  s@xmath11 of the expected @xmath49 or @xmath50 values , the exception being au  mic ( star # 39 ) .
this comparison is valid whether the measured velocities considered are @xmath28 or @xmath51 , with the exception of @xmath47  cap , for which the @xmath28 velocities are poorly constrained and therefore discrepant ( see  4.5 ) . of the 21 lines of sight without the benefit of the mg  ii or fe  ii data ,
10 show line centroids over 3 km  s@xmath11 from the expected @xmath49/@xmath50 values .
the worse agreement for these sight lines is surely due to unresolved velocity structure , especially considering that the @xmath20 values for 7 of these 10 lines of sight are suspiciously high based on previous work .
previous analyses of high resolution hst spectra , constrained by knowledge of the ism velocity structure , have generally suggested that warm , partially neutral clouds within the local bubble typically have temperatures of @xmath60  k , corresponding to doppler parameters of @xmath61 km  s@xmath11 @xcite .
thus , doppler parameters of @xmath62 km  s@xmath11 are suggestive of possible unresolved velocity components .
( see the notes on the ad  leo analysis in  4.5 for an example of how unresolved velocity structure can artificially increase measured doppler parameters . )
one issue that should be mentioned is that the @xmath20 values reported in table  2 , which are derived from the h  i+d  i fits , are almost always @xmath63 km  s@xmath11 larger than those that we measure from the d  i - only fits [ assuming @xmath23 ] , such as the fits shown in figure  3 .
the most likely explanation for this is that the lsf we are assuming is slightly broader than it should be , meaning that we are overcorrecting for instrumental broadening .
for the two single - component fits in figure  3 ( @xmath1  boo and dk  uma ) , the difference between the pre- and post - convolution fits indicates the extent that the d  i absorption profile is unresolved based on our assumed lsf .
the d  i line is clearly not entirely resolved in the e140 m data , which means that the convolution correction is important and that uncertainties in the lsf will lead to uncertainties in the fit parameters , especially @xmath31 .
this emphasizes the importance of high spectral resolution in the ly@xmath0 analyses .
finally , since we are _ a priori _ assuming a d / h value in our fits , our analysis can not refine the value of the local bubble d / h ratio , but we can at least say that our success in fitting the data in figures  6 and 7 indicates that the ly@xmath0 data analyzed here are all consistent with the assumed value of @xmath27 .
we here provide comments on some of the individual lines of sight that have been analyzed .
these include not only notes of particular interest about the lines of sight , but also in some cases details about how multiple ism components were constrained and especially the precise evidence for heliospheric and astrospheric absorption , when present .
the comments frequently refer to information listed in tables 1 and 2 .    ad leo ( # 31 ) : : :    this line of sight is notable for having a remarkably high ism h  i    column density , @xmath65 , given its very    short distance of 4.69  pc .
the implied average density of    @xmath66 @xmath67 is to our    knowledge the highest average density yet measured for any line of    sight within 100  pc ( i.e. , within the local bubble ) , being slightly    above the @xmath68 @xmath67 value    towards hd  82558 ( see table  1 ) .
the large @xmath20    value of the fit and the discrepancy between    @xmath28 and the expected @xmath49    velocity strongly imply the presence of multiple ism components .
there    are no high resolution mg  ii spectra available to verify this , but in    figure  8 we show an alternative fit to the data where an arbitrary    second ism component is included .
the second component is assumed to    be redshifted by 12 km  s@xmath11 from the primary    component , with a column density a factor of 10 lower than that of the    primary component .
the doppler parameters of the two components are    forced to be identical , and in the fit the doppler parameter of both    components ends up at @xmath36    km  s@xmath11 .
this is a more plausible result than the high    @xmath69 km  s@xmath11 value from    the single component fit , illustrating how the presence of multiple    components can artificially increase measured doppler parameters .
the    primary reason that the figure  6 fit has such a poor    @xmath22 value ( @xmath70 ) is    the very high signal - to - noise ( s / n ) of the data .
the high s / n is a    result of the unusually long 52  ksec exposure time of the coadded hst    spectrum , which was taken as part of an extensive flare monitoring    campaign @xcite .
ev lac ( # 32 ) : : :    figure  7 shows that there is a lot of excess h  i absorption on the    blue side of the line , resulting in the centroid of the h  i absorption    being highly blueshifted with respect to the d  i absorption .
this    therefore represents a convincing detection of astrospheric    absorption .
70 oph ( # 33 ) : : :    the mg  ii analysis by rl02 suggests a complex line of sight with 3 ism    components , including a component ( component 3 in table  2 ) that is    shifted relative to the primary component by an unusually large amount    for such a short sight line . the primary component ( component 1 ) is a    g cloud component . the complexity of the ism structure complicates the    ly@xmath0 analysis . in fitting d  i by itself ( see    fig .
3 ) , we find that we can not fit the data well enough while forcing    the column density ratios of the 3 components to be consistent with    those of the mg  ii fit , so in figure  3 we have allowed the column    density ratios to be different .
this d  i fit predicts a doppler    parameter for the h  i absorption of    @xmath71 km  s@xmath11    [ assuming as always @xmath23 ] ,    implying a very low ism temperature of @xmath72  k ,    consistent with the results of @xcite .
this measurement is not    implausible since other g cloud lines of sight have also shown    particularly low temperatures @xcite . in the d  i+h
i    fit shown in figure  7 and figure  9a we force the column density ratios    to be the same as those derived from the d  i - only fit .
however , fits    to the data with only the ism components invariably require    @xmath73 km  s@xmath11 in order    to produce h  i absorption broad enough to fit the data .
this fit    obviously produces d  i absorption much too broad to fit the d  i line ,    considering the low @xmath74    km  s@xmath11 measurement quoted above from the d  i - only    fit .
thus , the data require the addition of an hs / as component in    order to explain the overly broad h  i absorption .
the best fit in    figure  7 shows excess absorption on both sides of the line , implying    the presence of both heliospheric and astrospheric absorption .
note    that because the blueshifted component  3 is not a strong contributor    to the d  i absorption , it is possible to allow _ only _ that component    to have @xmath73 km  s@xmath11    while still fitting d  i reasonably well . in doing so , component 3    becomes broad enough to account for the excess blue - side h  i    absorption , as shown in figure  9b , meaning that only heliospheric h  i    absorption would be inferred from the data .
however ,    @xmath73 km  s@xmath11 is    inconsistent with the width of the mg  ii line . even in the unlikely    case
that the component  3 mg  ii absorption line is entirely thermally    broadened , the mg  ii doppler parameter of    @xmath75 km  s@xmath11    measured by rl02 suggests an upper limit for the h  i doppler parameter    of @xmath76 km  s@xmath11 , so we do    not consider the fit in figure  9b to be an acceptable interpretation    of the data .
thus , we believe the astrospheric detection implied by    the fit in figure  7 is solid , as well as the heliospheric detection . @xmath1 boo ( # 34 ) : : :    excess absorption on both sides of the ly@xmath0 line is    indicated by the fit in figure  7 , so this is both a heliospheric and    an astrospheric detection . the heliospheric absorption is slightly    stronger than the astrospheric absorption , inducing a slight redshift    of the total h  i absorption relative to d  i. thus , the evidence for    the heliospheric absorption is somewhat stronger than the evidence for    the astrospheric absorption .
evidence for the astrospheric absorption    relies on the relative widths of the h  i and d  i lines .
figure  10    shows a fit to the @xmath1  boo data in which the centroid of    the hs / as absorption component is fixed in such a way that it can only    account for the red - side excess ( i.e. , the heliospheric absorption ) .
the fit works well for h  i , but the    @xmath77 km  s@xmath11 value    of the ism absorption leads to a d  i absorption line that is too    broad .
the d  i - only fit in figure  3 suggests    @xmath78 km  s@xmath11 .
we    believe that this discrepancy is too large to be explained by the    possible lsf problem noted in  4.4 , so we can not consider the fit to    d  i in figure  10 to be acceptable .
thus , we conclude that the    astrospheric detection implied by the figure  7 fit is secure . since    the width of the ism absorption depends in part on    @xmath18 as well as @xmath20 ( see    fig
.  5 ) , uncertainties in @xmath18 could potentially    lead to an erroneous detection of hs / as absorption . in  4.2 , we    estimate uncertainties in @xmath18 to be typically    @xmath45% after including systematic errors , such as    uncertainties in the @xmath27    assumption . in figure  11 , we repeat the fit from figure  7 , but we also    show how the ism absorption profile changes when the h  i column    density is changed by 10% . a 10% increase in    @xmath18
clearly does not come close to explaining    the excess h  i absorption that we believe is hs / as absorption .
61 vir ( # 35 ) : : :    the evidence for the heliospheric and astrospheric absorption shown in    figure  7 is almost identical to that for @xmath1  boo , so the    61  vir analysis mirrors the @xmath1  boo analysis described    above .
however , the s / n of the 61  vir data is not nearly as high as    that of the @xmath1  boo spectrum .
this means that the width    of the d  i absorption ( and therefore the ism h  i absorption as well )    can not be measured with the same precision .
thus , the evidence for the    astrospheric absorption is weaker , and in table  1 we indicate only a    marginal detection of astrospheric absorption .
@xmath2 eri ( # 37 ) : : :    the enormous amount of excess h  i absorption on the blue side of the    line leads to a large blueshift of h  i relative to d  i , amounting to a    very convincing detection of astrospheric absorption ( see fig .  7 ) . @xmath79
cet ( # 38 ) : : :    this is a complex , 3 component line of sight based on the mg  ii data    ( rl02 ) . as is the case for 70  oph ( see above ) , we find that the d  i    absorption is fitted significantly better when the individual    components are allowed to have column density ratios different from    that of mg  ii .
thus , the fit in figure  3 allows the column densities    of the individual components to vary , and in our h  i+d  i fits we force    the column density ratios to be the same as for the d  i - only fit .
however , we are unable to fit the data with the usual assumption of    equal doppler parameters for all ism components . in order to fit the    data we allow the most blueshifted component ( component 3 ) to have a    higher doppler parameter , which in our best fit is    @xmath80 km  s@xmath11 .
this    is suspiciously high for local ism material , but the    @xmath20 value is not inconsistent with the    @xmath81 km  s@xmath11    measurement ( rl02 ) , unlike what happens in the similar 70  oph analysis    ( see above ) .
thus , we conclude that the fit is plausible and no hs / as    absorption component is required to fit the data .
au mic ( # 39 ) : : :    this is the one line of sight for which _ both _
h  i and mg  ii    velocities imply a significant discrepancy from the values predicted    by the g and lic vectors ( see table  2 ) .
the mg  ii absorption lines    analyzed by rl02 do not show asymmetries that would demonstrate the    presence of multiple ism components , but both the mg  ii and h  i    doppler parameters , @xmath82    km  s@xmath11 and @xmath83    km  s@xmath11 , are suspiciously high .
the mg  ii spectrum    analyzed by rl02 is a ghrs ech - b spectrum taken through ghrs s large    aperture before the installation of the costar corrective optics .
the    spectrum therefore has significantly lower resolution than is normally    achievable with the high resolution gratings of ghrs and stis .
furthermore , it is difficult to estimate the shape of the stellar    mg  ii profile above the ism absorption due to the narrowness of the    mg  ii emission lines , and the location of the ism absorption on the    side of the line . for these reasons ,
we suspect that there are in fact    multiple ism components towards au  mic that are not apparent due to    these difficulties with the mg  ii data .
finally , it is worth noting    that a debris disk has recently been discovered around au  mic ( * ? ? ?
* ;    * ? ? ?
despite being edge - on , there is to our knowledge no evidence    for any absorption from the disk in the uv spectra of au  mic from hst ,    including the ly@xmath0 line analyzed here .
the disk must    therefore be gas - poor .
dor ( # 40 ) : : :    for this two - component fit , we force the velocity separations and    column density ratios of the components to be the same as in the mg  ii    fit of rl02 , but it is necessary to allow the doppler parameters of    both components to vary in order to fit the h  i absorption .
component  1 ends up with a very high doppler parameter of    @xmath85 km  s@xmath11 .
however , the mg  ii doppler parameter of    @xmath86 km  s@xmath11    reported by rl02 for this component is also extremely high , so we    believe that the high @xmath20 value is plausible .
hd 165185 ( # 45 ) : : :    the h  i absorption shows a small but significant redshift relative to    the d  i absorption , indicating the presence of heliospheric    absorption , as shown in figure  7 .
hd 203244 ( # 46 ) : : :    the @xmath87 column density for hd  203244    is high enough that the h  i and d  i absorption lines are completely    blended ( see fig
this line of sight and that towards hd  82558    have two of the three highest column densities listed in table  1 ,    despite these stars being only about 20  pc away . since column    densities this high are clearly rare within the local bubble , they are    presumably due to relatively small clouds that few sight lines pass    through . in order to explain the high columns
, these small clouds must    necessarily have average densities that are significantly higher than    the @xmath88  @xmath67 value    that is typical for the lic @xcite .
hd 106516 ( # 50 ) : : :    a clear d  i absorption line can not be discerned in the data , partly    due to poor s / n and partly due to a high h  i column density that leads    to d  i and h  i being at least partly blended .
the measured h  i column    density of @xmath89 is the only fit    parameter that can be trusted , and this value is probably good to only    within @xmath90  dex considering systematic errors .
this    is at the upper end of the range of @xmath18    uncertainties for our measurements quoted in  4.2 .
hd 128987 ( # 52 ) : : :    analogous to the ev  lac and @xmath2  eri lines of sight    mentioned above , the hd  128987 data show extensive blue - side excess    h  i absorption , implying a substantial amount of astrospheric    absorption ( see fig .
the detection is very convincing despite the    rather poor s / n of the data . in the figure
7 fit , the hs / as component    is forced to have a centroid on the blue side of the h  i line to keep    it from contributing absorption to the red side of the h  i line .
( if    the resulting fit in figure  7 had been poor , that would have been    evidence for heliospheric absorption , in addition to the astrospheric    absorption . )
dk uma ( # 53 ) : : :    figure  12 shows the best fit to the data possible with only ism    absorption .
the fit shows a bit too much absorption on the blue side    of the d  i line , and slightly too little absorption on the blue side    of the h  i line . in other words ,
the h  i absorption in reality seems    to be slightly blueshifted relative to d  i , suggesting the presence of    astrospheric absorption .
thus , the best fit in figure  7 includes an    hs / as component .
the implied excess absorption is quite weak compared    with the other detections of astrospheric and heliospheric absorption ,    but the s / n of the data is good enough for the problems with the    figure  12 fit to be considered significant .
furthermore , there are    mg  ii observations that show only a single ism component towards    dk  uma , which means that the deficiencies of the figure  12 fit are not    due to any effects of multiple ism components .
thus , we consider this    to be an astrospheric detection , though we consider it a marginal one ,    as noted in table  1 .
the hs / as component in the figure  7 fit    contributes a little absorption to the red side of the line as well as    to the blue side where the astrospheric absorption resides , but the    red - side contribution is too weak for us to consider that to be    evidence for heliospheric absorption . v471
tau ( # 58 ) : : :    this target is a k2  v+da eclipsing binary with a very short period of    0.51  days . the uv stis spectrum as a whole is a continuum spectrum    from the hot white dwarf star , but the white dwarf continuum decreases    dramatically near ly@xmath0 so that the    ly@xmath0 emission line from the k2  v star contributes    most of the background for the ism ly@xmath0 absorption .    the spectrum shown in figure  1 is the result of a coaddition of    spectra taken at different orbital phases , which we do in order to    provide sufficient s / n for our analysis . since the ism absorption is    stationary in the individual exposures , the coaddition is valid for    our purposes despite the fact that the overlying    ly@xmath0 profile of the k2  v star moves due to the rapid    orbital motion .
the nonstationary emission results in a reconstructed    line profile in figure  6 that looks strange and is in fact unphysical ,    but an average integrated stellar ly@xmath0 line flux can    still be estimated from it ( see  7 ) .
variable ultraviolet absorption    features in _ international ultraviolet explorer _ ( iue ) and ghrs    spectra have been interpreted as being due to coronal mass ejections    ( cmes ) from the k2  v star , with an implied mass loss rate much higher    than that of the sun @xcite .
we see no astrospheric h  i    absorption that would provide additional evidence for a strong wind    from v471  tau .
this by no means disproves the cme interpretation of    the variable uv features , given the likely possibility that v471  tau    is surrounded by a fully ionized ism that will produce no astrospheric    h  i absorption regardless of the stellar mass loss rate ( see  6 ) .
hd 209458 ( # 59 ) : : :    this star has a planetary companion that transits in front of the star    once every 3.52  days @xcite . by comparing stis g140 m    ly@xmath0 spectra taken during and outside transit times ,    @xcite find that the ly@xmath0 profile decreases as much    as 15% at some wavelengths during transit , suggesting absorption from    an extended , evaporating planetary atmosphere .
this does not affect    our analysis of the ism absorption in the e140 m spectrum , however , and    we are able to fit the rather noisy d  i and h  i absorption lines with    a single ism absorption component . @xmath56
peg ( # 60 ) : : :    the ism mg  ii and fe  ii absorption lines show three velocity    components for this line of sight ( rl02 ) . due to the saturated nature    of the mg  ii lines , we decide that the less opaque fe  ii lines provide    more precise constraints for our fits in figures  3 and 6 .
thus , the    @xmath51 velocities listed in table  2 for    @xmath56  peg are in this case the fe  ii velocities . for    the ly@xmath0 fit in figure  6
, we force the velocity    separations and column density ratios of the components to be the same    as fe  ii , but we have to allow the doppler parameters of the    individual components to be different to acceptably fit the data .
the    doppler parameters of the two weaker components ( components 1 and 3 )    are suspiciously high ( see table  2 ) , but they are not inconsistent    with the fe  ii doppler parameters from rl02 . considering uncertainties    induced by the complexity of the line of sight ,
we conclude that this    is a reasonable fit .
hd 32008 ( # 61 ) : : :    this target is a g7  iv - iii+da binary according to @xcite . as is the    case for v471  tau ( see above ) , the white dwarf dominates the uv    spectrum everywhere except in the region of ly@xmath0 ,    where the emission line from the g7  iv - iii star provides most of the    background continuum for the ism absorption .
there are no mg  ii or    fe  ii spectra to precisely define the ism velocity structure of this    line of sight , but inspection of the d  i absorption reveals that this    is one case where ism velocity components are so widely separated that    evidence for multiple components is apparent even in the broad d  i    line ( see fig .  3 ) .
thus , in figure  3 d  i is fitted with two    components .
the h  i+d  i fit in figure  6 is likewise performed with two    components , where we force them to have the same doppler parameters ,    but allow their velocities and column densities to both vary .
@xmath47 cap ( # 62 ) : : :    three ism velocity components are suggested by the mg  ii and fe  ii    absorption lines ( rl02 ) . as is the case for @xmath56  peg    ( see above ) , the mg  ii lines are saturated , so we decide to use the    less opaque fe  ii lines to constrain the fit in figure  6 .
thus , the    @xmath51 velocities listed in table  2 for    @xmath47  cap are actually fe  ii velocities .
the h  i column    density for this line of sight , @xmath91 ,    is high enough that d  i is nearly saturated and is almost completely    blended with the h  i absorption .
this blending and the complexity of    the line of sight make the analysis poorly constrained and very    uncertain .
we believe that the large h  i doppler parameters ,    @xmath92 km  s@xmath11 , and the large    discrepancies between the @xmath28 and    @xmath51 velocities in table  2 are a consequence    of these difficulties and the discrepancies should therefore be    regarded with skepticism .
the 33 new lines of sight that we have analyzed have resulted in 4 new detections of heliospheric ly@xmath0 absorption .
this brings the total number of detections to 8 , if one considers the alpha / proxima cen detections as a single line of sight .
this is a large enough number that we can investigate what the lines of sight that produce detectable absorption have in common .
there are really only two factors that determine whether a line of sight will have detectable heliospheric ly@xmath0 absorption .
one is the ism h  i column density , since a high ism column will mean a broad absorption line that will hide the heliospheric absorption .
the second factor is the orientation of the line of sight through the heliosphere .
this orientation is most simply described by the angle , @xmath93 , between the line of sight and the upwind direction of the ism flow seen by the sun .
this upwind direction has galactic coordinates of @xmath94 , @xmath95 @xcite .    in figure  13
, we plot the ism column densities , @xmath46 , versus @xmath93 for all the hst - observed lines of sight listed in table  1 .
different symbols are used to indicate which lines of sight have detectable heliospheric absorption and which do not .
the detections are nicely separated from the nondetections in this parameter space .
as expected , the lines of sight that yield detections tend to have low @xmath18 values .
it is also clearly easier to detect heliospheric absorption in upwind directions ( @xmath96 ) than in downwind directions ( @xmath97 ) .
models of the heliosphere can explain this behavior quite nicely .
it is in upwind directions that the heliospheric h  i suffers the strongest deceleration at the bow shock @xcite .
thus , the heliospheric absorption in these directions will be shifted away from the ism absorption to the greatest extent , making it easier to detect .
the success of the models in explaining the detection tendencies illustrated in figure  13 is additional strong evidence that heliospheric absorption is indeed the correct interpretation for the red - side excess ly@xmath0 absorption .    for the upwind directions ,
heliospheric absorption is only detected when @xmath98 , but in downwind directions a detection requires @xmath99 .
there simply are not many lines of sight that will have interstellar column densities of @xmath99 .
thus , the downwind detection of heliospheric absorption towards sirius may forever remain unique @xcite .
the properties of a line of sight through the heliosphere are described entirely by the angle @xmath93 only if the heliosphere is precisely axisymmetric
. however , significant deviations from axisymmetry are possible due to latitudinal solar wind variations , an ism magnetic field that is skewed with respect to the ism flow direction , or unstable mhd phenomena near the plane of the heliospheric current sheet @xcite .
there are now enough heliospheric absorption detections to conduct at least a crude investigation into whether there is evidence for any such asymmetries , and this will be a project for the near future .
the 7 new astrospheric detections found here bring the total number of detections up to 13 .
the astrospheric detections are primarily of interest because the astrospheric absorption provides a diagnostic for stellar winds that are otherwise completely undetectable .
mass loss rates have been measured for all of the older detections , and these measurements have been used to infer how winds vary with age and activity for solar - like main sequence stars @xcite .
we are currently measuring mass loss rates using the new astrospheric detections , but these results will have to wait for a future paper .    we can use the new detections to investigate what is common among the lines of sight that have detections , as we did for the heliospheric detections in  5 , but the situation is more complicated in the case of astrospheres .
there are many more factors involved in the detectability of the astrospheric absorption , including the nature of the ism surrounding the star , the total integrated ism h  i column density for the line of sight , the speed and orientation of the ism flow vector seen by the star , and the properties of the stellar wind .
a nondetections of astrospheric absorption could be due to any number of these factors , so it is generally impossible to use nondetections of astrospheric absorption to infer anything about the stellar wind or surrounding ism , unlike what can be done with the nondetections of heliospheric absorption ( see  5 ) .    in figure  14
, we plot the ism column density versus stellar distance for all of the hst - observed lines of sight listed in table  1 .
the hst data points are placed into three categories : lines of sight that yield detections of astrospheric absorption , lines of sight that yield nondetections , and other lines of sight for which a search for astrospheric absorption is not appropriate due to a hot star target or low spectral resolution ( see  2 ) .
finally , for completeness we also include in figure  14 five additional data points that are based on h  i column density measurements from the _ extreme ultraviolet explorer _
( euve ) or _
copernicus_. these lines of sight are wd  1634 - 573 @xcite , wd  2211 - 495 @xcite , wd  0621 - 376 @xcite , @xmath0  vir @xcite , and @xmath0  cru @xcite .    considering only those hst lines of sight for which a valid search for astrospheric absorption can be made
, the detection rate is quite high within 10  pc , with 10 of 17 independent sight lines producing detections for a detection rate of 58.8% .
the situation worsens dramatically beyond 10  pc , with only 3 of 31 lines of sight yielding detections , for a detection rate of only 9.7% .
furthermore , 2 of the 3 detections beyond 10  pc are considered only marginal detections ( see table  1 ) .
there are two reasons for the distance dependence of astrospheric detectability .
one is simply that longer lines of sight tend to have higher ism column densities , as shown by figure  14 .
this means that the ism h  i ly@xmath0 absorption will be broader , which can hide the astrospheric absorption .
a second major problem with more distant targets is that there is a high probability that they will be surrounded by hot , ionized ism material with no neutrals , which will therefore inject no h  i into the astrospheres to produce ly@xmath0 absorption .
the local bubble is believed to be mostly filled with this ionized material ( e.g. , * ? ? ?
* ; * ? ? ?
there are regions of warm , partially neutral material embedded within the local bubble , and it just so happens that the sun is located within one of these regions , explaining why even the nearest lines of sight have substantial h  i column densities ( see table  1 )
. however , the further a star is from the sun , the more likely it will be located in the more prevalent ionized ism .
this is evident in figure  14 , which shows that h  i column densities do not increase much beyond 10  pc , and average h  i densities therefore decrease .
since an astrospheric detection requires the presence of neutral material in the ism surrounding the observed star , a detection of astrospheric absorption represents an _ in situ _ detection of neutral ism at the star s location .
thus , the astrospheric detections can in principle be used to crudely map out locations of warm , partially neutral clouds embedded within the local bubble . the 58.8% detection fraction within 10
pc suggests that neutral clouds occupy about 58.8% of space within 10  pc , although in reality this is really just a lower bound since nondetections of astrospheres can be for many reasons other than an ionized surrounding ism ( see above ) .
it must also be noted that the observed targets are preferentially nearby rather than being randomly distributed throughout the volume of space within 10  pc , so the filling fraction lower limit of 0.588 is biased towards shorter distances .
nevertheless , these results clearly suggest that most of the ism within 10  pc is warm , partially neutral gas , which is atypical within the local bubble .    various observations of ism h  i atoms flowing through the heliosphere provide estimates of the h  i density immediately surrounding the sun .
these estimates are typically @xmath100 @xmath67 @xcite . except for the new measurement towards ad  leo ( see  4.5 ) , average line - of - sight densities within 10  pc are always well below this value ( see fig .
14 ) , so crude models of the distribution of gas in the very local ism have typically assumed instead @xmath101 @xmath67 @xcite .
most of the 10  pc lines of sight shown in figure  14 have densities even lower than this , including most of the astrospheric detections .
of particular interest is the @xmath1  boo line of sight .
the mg  ii absorption data show only a single velocity component , with a velocity consistent with the lic vector ( rl02 ) .
since @xmath1  boo is an astrospheric detection , that would suggest that the lic must extend the entire 6.70  pc distance towards @xmath1  boo , but this means that the lic would have an average density of only @xmath102 @xmath67 for this sight line , much lower than the @xmath103 @xmath67 value measured for the lic at the sun s location .
photoionization models of the lic predict that hydrogen ionization should increase and the h  i density therefore decrease towards the edge of the cloud due to less shielding from ionizing radiation ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , but not to the extent that one would expect to see _ this _ large a decrease in an _ average _ line - of - sight density .
there are two alternative explanations for the low average density .
it is possible that there are in fact two separate clouds along the line of sight that just happen to have the same projected velocity , in which case a sizable gap in between the clouds could explain the low average density .
such a situation must be the case for dk  uma if its marginal astrospheric detection is to be believed .
only a single lic mg  ii absorption component is observed towards dk  uma ( rl02 ) , but there is no way that the lic extends the 32.4  pc distance to that star .
the second explanation is that the lic has a substantial amount of subparsec scale patchiness , with the sun being located within a small , high - density patch .
both of these two explanations indicate that the ism velocity structure information provided by mg  ii and fe  ii absorption data may not be sufficient to infer the true character of the lic and other very nearby interstellar material .
it is worth noting that everything said above about the @xmath1  boo sight line also applies to the 36  oph sight line , except that the g cloud vector applies towards 36  oph instead of the lic vector .
both @xmath0  cen and 36  oph are g cloud lines of sight with astrospheric detections and with mg  ii spectra that show only a single g cloud component . however , the implied average h  i densities towards these stars are very different : @xmath104 @xmath67 and @xmath105 @xmath67 , respectively .
thus , the nearby ism in the direction where the g cloud vector applies appears to be just as inhomogeneous as the @xmath1  boo line of sight , despite the apparent simplicity of the mg  ii velocity structure .    with only 3 astrospheric detections beyond 10  pc , and with 2 of them being marginal detections
, it is harder to infer general properties of the ism beyond 10  pc from these results .
the low detection fraction is a serious problem for potential observational searches for astrospheric absorption beyond 10  pc .
in addition to our desire to use astrospheres to probe the ism beyond 10  pc , the stellar wind research would also benefit from more distant detections , since there are many classes of stars that do not have many representatives within 10  pc . if the goal is to investigate what astrospheric absorption and stellar winds are like for giants or young , solar - like g stars , for example , it is necessary to look beyond 10  pc to find targets .
if astrospheres could be detected from the ground , an extensive observing program could be proposed and a low @xmath106% detection fraction tolerated , but this is not practical when the only instrument capable of detecting the astrospheres is the uv spectrograph on board hst . for the time being , this point may be moot .
the apparent recent demise of the stis instrument in 2004 august means that no new high resolution ly@xmath0 spectra will be possible for the foreseeable future .
the h  i ly@xmath0 line is one of the strongest and most important emission lines from the upper chromospheres of cool stars .
however , the very strong ism absorption that is always present in observations of this line makes measuring reliable line fluxes difficult ( landsman & simon 1993 ) . in order to measure an accurate line flux
, a high resolution spectrum must be obtained that resolves the line profile , and then the intrinsic stellar profile must be reconstructed using the kind of time - consuming analysis technique described in  4 . due to these complications ,
more attention has been given to other chromospheric diagnostics , such as the mg  ii h & k lines .
since relatively little has been done with ly@xmath0 measurements in the past , we believe it is worthwhile to see how our ism - corrected ly@xmath0 fluxes correlate with other , more popular activity diagnostics .
we use the reconstructed ly@xmath0 profiles shown in figures  6 and 7 to measure integrated ly@xmath0 fluxes for our stars , and these fluxes are listed in table  3 ( in ergs  @xmath3  s@xmath11 ) , along with fluxes measured from previously analyzed data ( see references in table  1 ) . for capella ( # 13 ) and hr  1099 ( # 21 )
, the fluxes are divided between the two unresolved stars of these binaries .
the division was made during the absorption analysis for capella @xcite , while for hr  1099 we assume the division between the stars is the same for ly@xmath0 as it is for the mg  ii lines @xcite .
many of the ly@xmath0 profiles in figures 6 and 7 have self - reversals near line center .
this is due to the frequent use of the mg  ii h & k lines to provide an initial guess for the shape of the ly@xmath0 profile .
however , it should be emphasized that the exact line shape should not be considered to be terribly precise , especially the parts of the line profile that lie above the saturated h  i absorption core where the data provide absolutely no information on the profile .
uncertainties in the integrated line fluxes in table  3 will generally be larger for the lines of sight with higher ism column densities since the correction for absorbed flux will generally be higher in those cases , but a typical average error for the fluxes in table  3 is of order 20% .
coronal x - ray and chromospheric mg  ii fluxes are also listed in table  3 for comparison with the ly@xmath0 fluxes .
the x - ray fluxes are from the _ rosat _ all - sky survey ( rass ) , which used the position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) instrument .
the exception is @xmath107  her ( # 43 ) , for which a pointed pspc observation is used since this star is undetected in the rass . over half
the x - ray fluxes are taken from the nearby star survey of @xcite .
the bright and giant star rass surveys of @xcite provide many additional fluxes .
measurements for three of the hyades stars ( # 55#57 ) are from @xcite . for four stars ( # 18 , # 19 , # 25 , and # 52 )
, we compute a flux ourselves from the rass count rate listed in the heasarc database and an assumed conversion factor of @xmath108 ergs  @xmath3  ct@xmath11 .
the white dwarf companions of v471  tau ( # 58 ) and hd  32008 ( # 61 ) presumably dominate their x - ray fluxes , so no fluxes are listed in table  3 for these stars .
many binaries are not resolved in _
rosat _ pspc observations , making it impossible to know how to divide the x - ray flux among the individual stars . for the @xmath0  cen and 61  cyg binaries , _ rosat
_ high resolution imager ( hri ) observations that resolve the binaries are used to determine how to divide the rass x - ray fluxes among the stars in table  3 @xcite .
for capella ( # 13 ) , we assume the relative contributions of the two stars to the coronal fe  xxi @xmath1091356 line @xcite are applicable to the coronal x - ray flux as well . for hr
1099 ( # 21 ) and @xmath1  boo ( # 34 ) , the emission is known to be dominated by the primary stars of these binaries , so we simply assign all the x - ray flux to those stars .
finally , we have recently used the _
chandra _ x - ray telescope to resolve the 70  oph ( # 33 ) and 36  oph ( # 10 ) binaries .
these data will be discussed in detail in a future paper , but we can report here that 70  oph  a and 36  oph  a contribute 60.4% and 58.2% of the fluxes of these binaries , respectively , so these results are used to modify the rass fluxes in table  3 .
the mg  ii fluxes in table  3 are combined fluxes of the h & k lines .
most of the fluxes are measured from hst spectra .
although many of the ism mg  ii lines are discussed and analyzed by rl02 , and some of the references in table  1 also discuss mg  ii spectra , emission line fluxes have not usually been reported so we generally have to measure these fluxes ourselves .
however , we use the measurements of @xcite and @xcite for capella ( # 13 ) and hr  1099 ( # 21 ) , respectively .
the chromospheric mg  ii emission line lies in the middle of a broad photospheric absorption line .
it is difficult to know what the profile of the absorption line is underneath the chromospheric emission line .
however , we measure our mg  ii fluxes by simply integrating the fluxes of the emission line without trying to correct for any continuum that may be underneath the lines ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?
* ; * ? ? ?
this basically assumes that the photospheric absorption is broad and saturated underneath the line .
this assumption will be a significant source of uncertainty ( @xmath110% ) only for the f stars in our sample , which have the strongest photospheric uv continua .
for those stars without high or moderate resolution hst spectra of mg  ii , we look for high resolution iue spectra that can be used to measure mg  ii fluxes .
fluxes measured from iue data are flagged in table  3 . in all our mg  ii measurements we try to remove ism absorption before making the flux measurements .
this is difficult in high resolution iue or moderate resolution hst spectra , since the narrow ism lines are not well resolved .
it is impossible in low resolution iue spectra , which do not even have sufficient resolution to separate the two mg  ii lines , so low resolution iue spectra are not used here .    in order to convert measured fluxes to surface fluxes
, we need to know the radii of our stars .
stellar radii are therefore listed in table  3 .
we search the literature for radii that are measured via interferometry or by other direct means , and references in table  3 indicate which radii come from such sources .
however , we estimate most of our radii following the prescription of @xcite , using the barnes - evans relation for most of the stars @xcite , but the radius - luminosity relation of @xcite for the m dwarfs .    finally , we wish to correlate our ly@xmath0 fluxes with rotation rates , so table  3 also lists rotation periods found in the literature for our sample of stars
. references in the table indicate the sources of the periods .
most are genuine photometric periods , but some are estimated from ca  ii measurements and a known ca  ii - rotation relation .
the periods derived from ca  ii are flagged in table  3 .    in figures  15a - b
, we plot ly@xmath0 surface fluxes versus x - ray and mg  ii surface fluxes , and in figure  15c the ly@xmath0 fluxes are plotted against rotation period .
in addition to plotting the stellar data listed in table  3 , we also add a solar data point to these figures .
we assume a solar ly@xmath0 flux of @xmath111 ergs @xmath3 s@xmath11 , the midpoint of a range quoted by @xcite .
a figure in @xcite implies that quiescent solar mg  ii k fluxes are about 1.6 times larger than ly@xmath0 .
given that the h line has about 75% the flux of the k line , we assume that the total mg  ii h & k flux is 2.8 times that quoted above for ly@xmath0 , @xmath112 ergs @xmath3 s@xmath11 . finally , the solar rotation period at the equator is about 26 days , and for the x - ray flux we assume a typical value of @xmath113 ergs @xmath3 s@xmath11 for the sun @xcite .
the chromospheric ly@xmath0 fluxes are highly correlated with the chromospheric mg  ii and coronal x - ray fluxes in figures  15a - b , as expected .
they are anti - correlated with rotation period in figure  15c , consistent with many previous studies showing how rapid rotation induces higher degrees of chromospheric and coronal activity in cool stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?
the sun is nicely consistent with the other g star data points in figures  15a - c , which is encouraging .
figures 15a - c show separate least squares fits to the f  v+g  v , k  v , and giant ( iii ) stars , in addition to fits to all the stars combined .
we combine the f  v stars with the g  v stars since the few f  v stars are all late f stars and these data points are basically consistent with the more numerous g stars .
there are not enough subgiants ( iv ) and m  v stars to justify making separate fits to those data . in order to estimate uncertainties in the fit parameters , we use a monte carlo method . for a large number of trials
, we randomly vary the data points within assumed error bars , conduct new fits for each of these trials , and see how much the fit parameters vary .
the assumed error bars are estimated as follows .
the biggest source of uncertainty in the fluxes is generally target variability rather than measurement uncertainty .
@xcite estimates that _ rosat _ pspc fluxes should cover a range of about a factor of 4 during solar - like activity cycles , so we assume 0.3  dex uncertainties for the @xmath114 values .
the solar ly@xmath0 flux range quoted by @xcite represents a @xmath115% variation from the median value due to solar cycle and rotational variability .
we assume this result roughly applies to the mg  ii fluxes as well and therefore estimate 0.08  dex uncertainties for @xmath116 .
combining this uncertainty with the previously quoted @xmath117% measurement uncertainty for the ly@xmath0 fluxes leads us to assume 30% ( 0.11  dex ) uncertainties for @xmath118 .
probably the major source of uncertainty for the rotation periods is the presence of differential rotation , which leads to @xmath119 being a somewhat ill - defined parameter .
we conservatively assume 20% ( 0.08  dex ) errors for this quantity .
table  4 lists the resulting fit parameters and 1@xmath42 uncertainties for all the fits in figures  15a - c .    although ly@xmath0 and mg  ii are both broadly called chromospheric lines , the relations between @xmath118 and @xmath116 in figure  15b are not quite linear . for example
, the power law index for the f  v+g  v stars quoted in table  4 is @xmath120 .
this is well below 1 and suggests that the ly@xmath0 flux increases more rapidly with activity than mg  ii .
this effect is also evident when comparing our @xmath121 relations with the @xmath122 relations from @xcite . for solar - like g dwarfs
, we find @xmath123 while @xcite quotes @xmath124 .
since higher temperature lines are known to exhibit stronger increases when plotted as a function of any activity diagnostic , these results suggest that the ly@xmath0 line is formed at somewhat hotter temperatures than mg  ii , consistent with the predictions of atmospheric models @xcite . it is interesting that the @xmath125 relation of the giant stars appears to be noticeably more linear than for the dwarfs , and surprisingly tight considering the diverse makeup of this group of stars .
@xcite quote a power law index of @xmath126 in their plot of c  ii fluxes versus @xmath119 for a selection of solar - like g stars .
this is somewhat steeper than our analogous @xmath127 relation , which has a power law of @xmath128 ( see table  4 ) .
this suggests that the ly@xmath0 lines are formed at temperatures cooler than c  ii , and therefore somewhere in between the mg  ii and c  ii line formation temperatures .
the k dwarf relations in figures  15a and 15c are reasonably tight , but this is not the case in 15b .
the k star data points in figure  15b show a lot of scatter , with the two largest discrepancies being the two latest type stars , 61  cyg  a and @xmath129  ind ( both k5  v ) .
given that the two m dwarfs in the figure are also discrepant in the same sense , perhaps the relation between mg  ii and ly@xmath0 undergoes a drastic change for stars with spectral types later than early k. it is also interesting to note that the k dwarf power law relation in figure  15a is noticeably steeper than that of the g star relation , while in figure  15c it is noticeably shallower .
the implication is that for a given increase in rotation , the chromospheric and coronal emission from k stars increases less than that of g stars , but for a given increase in chromospheric emission the x - ray fluxes of k stars increase _ more _ than the g stars .
the last panel of figure  15 compares our hst ly@xmath0 fluxes with previous measurements from iue data .
analyzing the ly@xmath0 line in iue spectra is much more difficult than in hst spectra for many reasons .
the s / n is lower , the spectral resolution is poorer , and not only must one correct for ism absorption but also for geocoronal contamination , which can be severe due to the much larger apertures of iue compared with hst .
@xcite developed techniques to deal with these difficulties and the iue measurements plotted in figure  15d are from their work . despite the complications with the iue analysis ,
the agreement between the iue and hst fluxes is reasonably good .
some of the scatter could be due to real stellar variability .
for the lower fluxes , the iue measurements tend to be systematically higher than suggested by hst , which may be due to inaccuracies in the iue s flux calibration at ly@xmath0 or due to the difficulties in subtracting the geocoronal signal .
the only data point in figure  15d that is truly discrepant is ev  lac , which has an iue flux about an order of magnitude larger than the hst flux . as
this m dwarf is a well known flare star , perhaps there was a strong flare during the iue observation .
we have analyzed 33 hst / stis e140 m ly@xmath0 spectra of cool stars located within 100  pc , in order to measure chromospheric ly@xmath0 fluxes , determine line - of - sight interstellar h  i and d  i properties , and search for detections of heliospheric and astrospheric absorption .
our findings are summarized as follows .    1 .
: :    we find that the geocoronal ly@xmath0 emission lines in    our spectra tend to be blueshifted with respect to their expected    locations by @xmath130 km  s@xmath11 ,    indicating a systematic error in the wavelength calibration of stis    e140 m spectra , at least in the ly@xmath0 wavelength    region .
2 . : :    our analysis of the d  i and h  i ly@xmath0 absorption    lines has led to 4 new detections of heliospheric    ly@xmath0 absorption ( 70  oph , @xmath1  boo ,    61  vir , and hd  165185 ) , bringing the total number of detections to 8 .
we find 7 new astrospheric detections ( ev  lac , 70  oph ,    @xmath1  boo , 61  vir , @xmath2  eri , hd  128987 ,    and dk  uma ) , although we consider the 61  vir and dk  uma detections to    be marginal .
this brings the total number of detected astrospheres to    13 .
: :    we have measured interstellar h  i column densities for all 33 lines of    sight , which are listed in tables  1 and 2 . of particular interest are    the surprisingly high column densities towards ad  leo    [ @xmath65 ] and hd  203244    [ @xmath87 ] . for the short 4.69  pc line of    sight to ad  leo , the suggested average density of    @xmath66 @xmath67 represents a    new high for a local bubble line of sight .
the rarity of    @xmath133 lines of sight within the local    bubble implies that detections of column densities this high are    probably due to compact clouds that likely have densities well above    the @xmath88 @xmath67 values    believed to apply to the very local ism within 10  pc .
4 . : :    when plotting ism h  i column densities versus @xmath93 ,    the angle between the line of sight and the upwind direction of the    ism flow , the heliospheric detections are nicely separated from the    nondetections .
only lines of sight with low ism h  i column densities    have detected heliospheric absorption , and it is much easier to detect    the heliospheric absorption in upwind directions ( i.e. ,    @xmath134 ) . in the most upwind directions , an    ism column of @xmath135 is required to    detect heliospheric absorption , while in downwind directions one must    have @xmath136 . this behavior is    consistent with expectations from heliospheric models and represents    further strong evidence in support of the heliospheric interpretation    of the excess red - side ly@xmath0 absorption . 5 . : :    within 10  pc , 10 of the 17 analyzed hst lines of sight have yielded    detections of astrospheric absorption , for a detection rate of 58.8% .
since the presence of h  i in the surrounding ism is one necessary    ingredient for an astrospheric detection , the 58.8% detection fraction    represents a lower limit for the filling factor of neutral ism    material within 10  pc , meaning that neutral hydrogen must be present    in most of the ism within 10  pc .
however , beyond 10  pc only 3 of 31    hst lines of sight have astrospheric detections , for a much lower    detection rate of 9.7% .
some of this difference is due to generally    higher ism h  i column densities for longer lines of sight , which    results in broader ism absorption that can hide the astrospheric    signal .
however , beyond 10  pc most of the stars are probably    surrounded by the hot , ionized ism material that is believed to fill    most of the local bubble , and this will account for many nondetections    of astrospheric absorption beyond 10  pc .
6 . : :    our ly@xmath0 absorption analyses requires the    reconstruction of intrinsic stellar ly@xmath0 emission    lines .
we use these lines to measure chromospheric h  i    ly@xmath0 fluxes for our sample of stars , which are    corrected for ism absorption .
we correlate these fluxes with coronal    x - ray and chromospheric mg  ii fluxes , and we also study the dependence    of ly@xmath0 emission on rotation period .
we present in    table  4 the derived relations for various classes of stars .

telescope _ ( hst ) archive for previously unanalyzed observations of stellar h  i ly@xmath0 emission lines , our primary purpose being to look for new detections of ly@xmath0 absorption from the outer heliosphere , and to also search for analogous absorption from the astrospheres surrounding the observed stars . 
 the astrospheric absorption is of particular interest because it can be used to study solar - like stellar winds that are otherwise undetectable . 
 we find and analyze 33 hst ly@xmath0 spectra in the archive . 
 all the spectra were taken with the e140 m grating of the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) instrument on board hst . 
 the hst / stis spectra yield 4 new detections of heliospheric absorption ( 70  oph , @xmath1  boo , 61  vir , and hd  165185 ) and 7 new detections of astrospheric absorption ( ev  lac , 70  oph , @xmath1  boo , 61  vir , @xmath2  eri , hd  128987 , and dk  uma ) , doubling the previous number of heliospheric and astrospheric detections . when combined with previous results , 10 of 17 lines of sight within 10  pc yield detections of astrospheric absorption . 
 this high detection fraction implies that most of the ism within 10  pc must be at least partially neutral , since the presence of h  i within the ism surrounding the observed star is necessary for an astrospheric detection . 
 in contrast , the detection percentage is only 9.7% ( 3 out of 31 ) for stars beyond 10  pc . 
 our ly@xmath0 analyses provide measurements of ism h  i and d  i column densities for all 33 lines of sight , and we discuss some implications of these results . finally , we measure chromospheric ly@xmath0 fluxes from the observed stars . 
 we use these fluxes to determine how ly@xmath0 flux correlates with coronal x - ray and chromospheric mg  ii emission , and we also study how ly@xmath0 emission depends on stellar rotation . "
"in the past ten years , the rosat and asca observations of galaxy clusters have revealed that there exist tight correlations between the total gravitating mass of clusters ( @xmath6 ) and the x - ray luminosity ( @xmath7 ) and the temperature ( @xmath8 ) of the intra - cluster medium ( icm ) ( e.g. david et al . , 1993 ; white , jones & forman 1997 ; markevitch 1998 ; wu , xue & fang , 1999 ; horner , mushotzky & scharf 1999 ; etc . ) .
presence of such relations has been also motivated by both the theoretical studies and the @xmath9-body numerical simulations .
a close comparison of the theoretical / simulated results and the observed data can therefore provide valuable constraints on the prevailing cosmological models and even on the nature of dark matter which dominates the mass distribution and the dynamical evolution of clusters .
however , in addition to its dependence on the hydrostatic equilibrium hypothesis , an accurate determination of @xmath6 often suffers from instrumental limitations , especially in those faint and distant clusters .
this compares with the icm temperature measurements which can be relatively easily performed through the x - ray spectroscopy in most clusters .
consequently , a well - established @xmath0  relation can instead be used as a powerful cluster mass estimator . in particular ,
based on the @xmath0  curve , one is able to link the observable quantities with the theoretical press - schechter mass function , which appears to be crucial for the determinations of the cosmological parameters using the cluster abundances at different redshifts .    within the framework of pure gravitational infall ( e.g. , lilje 1992 ) ,
the cluster mass and the gas temperature should scale simply as @xmath10 , where the index @xmath11 is almost unrelated to the different settings of the cosmological parameters .
this self - similarity has been justified by cosmological @xmath9-body simulations ( evrard et al .
1996 ; bryan & norman 1998 ; eke et al .
1998 ) , and has also been tested by numerous observations .
for example , hjorth et al .
( 1998 ) have inferred the cluster mass from the weak and strong lensing for 8 clusters and confirmed such a tight mass - temperature relation .
neumann et al .
( 1999 ) analyzed the rosat pspc and hri data of 26 clusters and estimated the cluster mass by fitting the x - ray brightness profiles with the isothermal @xmath2-model , coupled with the hydrostatic equilibrium assumption .
for a sub - sample of 15 targets whose temperature are available , they achieved a result consistent with @xmath12 .
however , it should be noticed that in the above observational analyses , only high - temperature ( @xmath13 kev ) clusters are involved . as has been realized in many recent studies ( e.g. mohr , mathiesen & evrard 1999 ; ponman , cannon & navarro 1999 ) , the influence of energy feed - back into icm in the low - temperature clusters / groups can become more significant than that in the high - temperature systems .
consequently , the self - similarity may break at the low - temperature end .
indeed , this has been confirmed in nevalainen et al .
( 2000 ) using a small sample of 9 clusters ( 6 clusters at @xmath14 kev and 3 groups at @xmath15 kev ) . from the asca and the rosat temperature profiles ,
the authors have found that for the whole sample @xmath6 scales as @xmath16 , which is apparently steeper than the theoretical prediction , whereas @xmath17 still holds if the low - temperature groups are excluded .    in the scenario of preheated icm , such a similarity break
can develop naturally in the low - temperature clusters / groups . a robust constraint on the break temperature ( @xmath18 ) can be obtained in principle by the observations of the @xmath7-@xmath8 or @xmath19-@xmath8 relations , which will in turn yield valuable information about the heating processes in the early phase of cluster formation . in the recent analysis of nevalainen
( 2000 ) , only a lower limit of 1 kev could be set to @xmath20 due to the temperature gap between @xmath21 kev in their sample . on the other hand ,
ponman et al .
( 1999 ) evaluated the entropy of icm in different systems and argued that @xmath20 could be as high as @xmath22 kev . yet , this seems to be inconsistent with the finding of horner et al .
( 1999 ) that the similarity of @xmath0  may continue until @xmath23 kev .    in this paper
, we report our study of the @xmath0  relation using a combined sample of 22 galaxy clusters observed with rosat and asca .
the radial x - ray surface brightness profiles are derived and fitted with different models .
based on the best - fit parameters , the total gravitational masses scaled to the virial radius and the icm entropies at the cluster central regions are calculated under the assumption of isothermality . throughout this paper , we employ the mekal model ( mewe , kaastra & liedahl 1995 ) to calculate the thermal emission from the plasma with a mean metallic abundance of 0.4 solar , and set the hubble constant to @xmath24 km s@xmath25 mpc@xmath25 .
our sample ( table [ tbl : targets ] ) consists of 22 galaxy clusters , whose redshifts range from @xmath26 to @xmath27 . at this distance range , the effect of cosmic evolution can be ignored .
rosat pspc data archived at the institute of high energy physics ( beijing ) are analyzed . in general , the observations are chosen in such a way that targets are located near the center of fov , which makes it easier to study their diffuse x - ray emission as a whole .
all the targets are sufficiently bright with their 210 kev flux being at least several @xmath28  @xmath29 . thus , with sufficient exposure times
, high signal - to - noise ratio can be achieved .
we selected targets that all demonstrate relatively good circular symmetry in their x - ray morphology , and contain no distinct substructures .
such systems may have been undisturbed for rather a long time , for which the assumption of spherical symmetry is more reasonable .
we have searched in the literature for the emission weighted asca temperatures for our targets . essentially , we choose the temperatures obtained when the central cluster regions are excluded .
this is to avoid the complication due to the additional cool emission component ( e.g. buote 2000 ) .
when the error bars of the temperatures are asymmetric , we adopt the values of the larger sides . among the targets
, a262 has the lowest temperature at @xmath30 kev , and a2029 is the hottest one at about 10 kev .
it appears that the sample almost covers the whole temperature range of clusters .
the galaxy groups with even lower temperatures at @xmath15 kev are not included in this work .
we have extracted the radial x - ray surface brightness profiles for the targets by directly using their 0.52 kev count rates ( figure [ fig : f1 ] ) .
two approaches are adopted to analytically approximate the observed @xmath1 : the @xmath31 fit via the conventional @xmath2 model and the @xmath31 fit via the theoretically expected @xmath1 tracing a priori given dark matter density profile . for the latter , we use the cusped nfw profile and the empirical burkert profile with a definite core radius .
if both galaxies and icm are assumed to be isothermal and trace the common gravitational potential in a cluster , the icm density @xmath32 can be represented by the so - called @xmath2 model when the galaxy distribution is assumed to follow the king profile ( cavaliere & fusco - femiano 1976 ) : @xmath33^{-3\beta/2}.\ ] ] this density profile can also be obtained by inversion of the observed @xmath34 in form of @xmath35^{-3\beta+\frac{1}{2}},\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the core radius and @xmath2 is the slope parameter . here , we use @xmath37 to represent the three - dimensional radius and @xmath38 for the two - dimensional radius , both measured from the cluster center .
the total cluster mass within radius @xmath37 can be derived from the hydrostatic equilibrium assumption as @xmath39      the second model we apply is the nfw profile , suggested by the high resolution @xmath40body simulations ( navarro , frenk , & white 1995 ) : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the halo density , @xmath43 is the scale radius , @xmath44 is the critical density of the universe , and @xmath45 is the characteristic density contract , respectively . in 1998 , makino , sasaki & suto derived an analytic form of gas distribution from eq([eq : nfw ] ) by assuming ( a ) spherical symmetry , ( b ) hydrostatic equilibrium , and ( c ) that the icm is an ideal gas : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a dimensionless constant . with eq([eq : nfwgas ] ) , we can straightforwardly calculate the icm x - ray emission and predict the corresponding x - ray surface brightness profile @xmath48 .
fitting this theoretically expected @xmath48 to the x - ray observed one , we will be able to check the goodness of fit by the nfw profile and simultaneously fix the free parameters @xmath43 and @xmath45 .
finally , we obtain the total cluster mass through @xmath49.\ ] ]      many recent observations , mainly based on the measurements of the rotation curves of dwarf galaxies , have shown that galactic halos may have flatter cores rather than the cusped density profiles such as the nfw profile . indeed
, such flat cores may develop if the dark matter particles are weakly self - interacting ( e.g. , spergel & steinhardt 1999 ; burkert 2000 ) .
an empirical density form for such halos is proposed by burkert ( 1995 ) : @xmath50 in which @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the central density and core radius , respectively .
although eq([eq : burkert ] ) was originally suggested for dwarf galaxies , it should also work for clusters , if the dark halos are self - similar .
indeed , the recent simulations of yoshida et al .
( 2000 ) have shown that eq([eq : burkert ] ) is applicable to clusters , provided that the halo particles are indeed self - interacting .    following makino et al .
( 1998 ) , we derive the radial gas distribution as @xmath53              - 2k_{0 } { \rm arctg}\left(\frac{r}{r_{0}}\right )                 \left(\frac{1}{r}+\frac{1}{r_{0}}\right )                  \right\},\ ] ] where @xmath54 is a dimensionless constant .
then , in a similar way to the nfw profile , we can predict the resulting x - ray surface brightness profile as a result of thermal emission and compare it with x - ray observations .
this would allow us to check the goodness of fit and work out the free parameters in the burkert profile and hence , the total cluster mass .
we find that the goodness of fit of @xmath1 is almost indistinguishable between the @xmath2 model and the nfw model ( table [ tbl : fits ] ) , but is apparently worse for the burkert model for which @xmath55 are larger by a factor of 2 - 3 .
we demonstrate one example ( a2199 ) in fig .
[ fig : f2 ] by plotting the residuals of the fittings for the burkert profile .
it is apparent that the model provides a significant overestimate of @xmath1 at about @xmath56 and an underestimate at the adjacent regions .
the situation is quite common in our fittings , implying that the burkert model tends to give a core which is too flat .
consequently , the failure of the burkert profile in the fittings of @xmath1 essentially excludes this empirical model in our mass estimates of clusters below .
based on the best - fits with the @xmath2 model and the nfw model , we calculate the total cluster mass within the virial radius @xmath57 , which is defined as the radius where the mean cluster density is @xmath58 times of the critical density of the universe . as can be seen in table
[ tbl : fits ] , the values of @xmath57 are typically in the range 1.53.5 mpc which are apparently larger than the observable radii of the clusters .
here we estimate @xmath57 for each cluster using the extrapolated mass profile .
the uncertainties in mass are calculated by taking into account the corresponding measurement errors in both the temperature and the surface brightness profile .
it is found that the resulted mass errors are always dominated by the errors of the surface brightness profile .
this last point is crucial because the estimates of virial radius and total cluster mass depend on gas temperature through equation ( 3 ) .
an apparent correlation between @xmath59 and @xmath60 may arise if the errors of the gas temperature are relatively large .
the mean error level for our cluster sample is about 20% , which is consistent with the predictions in the numerical studies .
the resulting mass and temperature relation is plotted in figure [ fig : f3 ] .    for the entire sample ,
we find that the best - fit mass - temperature relations are @xmath61 both of the relations are steeper than the theoretical prediction of @xmath62 . since such steepness has been suggested as a result of the pre - heating of icm , which could be more remarkable in the low - temperature systems , we have excluded the low - temperature clusters one by one to examine beyond which break temperature the similarity is restored .
we find that when those clusters at @xmath63 kev are excluded , the @xmath0  scaling become self - similar again with @xmath64 and @xmath65 for @xmath2 and nfw model , respectively .
this result agrees well with the one found by ponmann et al .
( 1998 ) , who discovered that in icm at @xmath66 kev the gas entropy is significantly higher than achievable through gravitational collapse alone .
recently , tozzi & normal ( 2000 ) used a generalized model to simulate the x - ray properties of the clusters .
their @xmath0  in the low density , cold dark matter universe with an initial entropy @xmath67 erg @xmath29 g@xmath68 is again in good accordance with our results , showing that the emission weighted temperature of the @xmath69 kev clusters are about 25% higher than what is predicted by the self - similar scaling .    in order to confirm our result of @xmath18 obtained via the @xmath0
, we calculate the icm entropy at @xmath70 and illustrate the entropy - temperature distribution in figure [ fig : f4 ] , where we use the entropy variable @xmath71 .
it appears that there is a clear tendency of the entropy increase for clusters at @xmath72 kev , suggesting again that @xmath18 should be between 3 and 4 kev .
we have analyzed the archival data of rosat pspc pointing observations of 22 galaxy clusters with gas temperatures ranging from 2 to 10 kev .
the radial surface brightness profiles are extracted from the 0.52 kev count rates , and are fitted with the @xmath2 model , the nfw model , and the burkert model , respectively .
we have found that the goodness of fit is indistinguishable between the @xmath2 model and the nfw model , but is significantly worse for the burkert model .
for the latter , the simple reason is that the burkert model tends to present too flat a core .
if the burkert model can be used to describe the gravitational potential wells in both the galactic halos and cluster halos within the framework of the self - interacting scenario , we may conclude that the cross - sections of dark matter particles may vary with halo sizes .
yoshida et al . ( 2000 ) have recently arrived at the similar conclusion by analyzing their @xmath9-body simulations .
based on the best - fit parameters of the @xmath2 model and the nfw model , we have calculated the cluster mass within the virial radius ( @xmath57 ) .
an examination of the @xmath0  shows that the @xmath0  is steeper than the self - similarity prediction unless the clusters at @xmath73 kev are excluded .
a further study of the icm entropy as a function of the temperature shows that an entropy floor is likely to present in the clusters cooler than @xmath14 kev .
therefore , we conclude that the break temperature of the self - similarity is at about 34 kev .
we have noticed that based on a more complicated sample with spatially resolved temperature profiles , finoguenov , reiprich & bhringer ( 2000 ) have arrived at a similar conclusion .
finally , our @xmath0  may be moderately affected if the intracluster gas deviates from the simple isothermality .
indeed , previous studies have arrived at conflicting results regarding the radial temperature gradients in clusters . for examples ,
irwin & bregman ( 2000 ) and tamura et al . (
2001 ) claimed an essentially flat temperature profile , while markevitch et al .
( 1998 ) and kaastra et al .
( 2000 ) reported a noticeable decline of gas temperature at large radii .
however , according to the recent analysis of finoguenov , reiprich & bhringer ( 2000 ) , it is unlikely that the @xmath0  can be significantly altered even if the temperature gradient is taken into account .

 two methods of the cluster mass estimations are employed and their results are compared : ( 1 ) the conventional @xmath2 model for gas distribution along with the isothermal and hydrostatic equilibrium assumptions , and ( 2 ) the nfw profile for dark matter distribution whose characteristic density and length are determined by the observed @xmath1 . 
 these two models yield essentially the same goodness of fits for @xmath1 and the similar @xmath0  relations , with the latter demonstrating a significant departure from the simple gravitational scaling of @xmath3 . 
 it is also shown that the best - fit @xmath0  relations could be reconciled with the theoretical expectation if the low - temperature clusters ( @xmath4 kev ) are excluded from the list , which lends support to the scenario that the intra - cluster medium is preheated in the early phase of cluster formation . 
 together with the entropy - temperature distribution , the existence of a similarity break at @xmath5 kev in the dynamical scaling relations for galaxy clusters has been confirmed . "
"in march of 2010 , the _ fermi_-lat collaboration announced a new gev transient in the galactic plane , fgl j2102 + 4542 , that was identified as a nova outburst in the symbiotic binary v407 cygni ( hereafter , v407 cyg ) .
at least seven gev transients located near the galactic plane have been discovered by egret , _
fermi_-lat and agile .
only two have been identified at other wavelengths : v407 cyg , which is the first nova to be detected at gev energies , and j0109 + 6134 , which was likely a background blazar @xcite .
the physical nature of the other five sources is unknown @xcite , and some of these gev transients may represent a new class of gamma - ray emitting objects .    the _ fermi_-lat collaboration reported variable gamma - ray emission in the 0.110  gev band from fgl j2102 + 4542 during 2010 march 1026 ( mjd 5526555281 ) @xcite .
its flux in gamma rays , binned on a day - to - day basis , peaked 2010 march 1314 with a flux of @xmath2 above 100  mev @xcite .
the gev gamma - ray activity lasted approximately two weeks .
the initial report of gev emission triggered very energetic radiation imaging telescope array system ( veritas ) observations of the object at very high energy ( vhe ; e @xmath0 100gev ) as part of an ongoing campaign to observe transients detected by _
fermi_-lat .
using multi - wavelength data , it was determined that the new transient was most likely associated with v407 cyg , a binary system consisting of a mira - type pulsating red giant and a white dwarf companion @xcite . a nova outburst from v407 cyg
was detected in the optical waveband on 2010 march 10 @xcite with a magnitude of @xmath3 , while pre - outburst magnitudes from the previous two years of monitoring ranged between magnitude 9 and 12 @xcite .
v407 cyg has been optically monitored for decades and has experienced previous outbursts , but the system had never been observed to be as bright as during the nova ( e.g. , * ? ? ?
* ; * ? ? ?
the onset of the optical outburst corresponds to the first significant detection of the source by the _
fermi_-lat on 2010 march 10 .
novae in red giant / white dwarf systems have been known to produce expanding shocks that can result in x - ray emission ( e.g. , the recurrent nova rs oph , * ? ? ?
* ; * ? ? ?
* ) , and indeed , x - ray emission from v407 cyg was detected after the nova @xcite .
based on the observed x - ray emission from the 2006 nova outburst of rs oph , before the launch of _
fermi_-lat , @xcite suggested that particles could be accelerated in novae up to tev energies , but gamma - ray emission from a nova had never previously been detected . here , we discuss the veritas observations of v407 cyg and their implications for gamma - ray emission from the nova .
we also describe an improved event reconstruction technique for stereo observations by imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes ( iacts ) made at large zenith angles ( lza ) .
veritas is a ground - based vhe gamma - ray observatory located at the fred lawrence whipple observatory in southern arizona .
it consists of four iacts sensitive from approximately 100 gev to above 30 tev .
each veritas telescope has a 12  m tessellated reflector with a total area of 110m@xmath4 .
each camera s focal plane contains 499 closed - packed circular photomultiplier tubes , giving a total field - of - view of @xmath5 .
gamma - rays incident onto the upper atmosphere induce a particle cascade , called an air shower , in which some charged particles have sufficient speed to emit cherenkov light .
the direction and energy of the original gamma ray can be reconstructed from images of the cherenkov light recorded by the telescopes .
when observing at small zenith angles ( @xmath6 ) , the array has an energy resolution of @xmath7 at 1 tev and an angular resolution of better than @xmath8 at 1 tev @xcite . for observations at lza , the energy and angular resolution are degraded and the energy threshold is increased .
veritas observed v407 cyg for several nights after the announcement of the _
fermi_-lat detection , during days 916 of the outburst ( 2010 march 1926 ) .
the zenith angle of these observations ranged between @xmath9 and @xmath10 .
the veritas telescopes are regularly operated in a mode called wobble mode , during which the location of the object to be observed is offset from the center of the field of view ( fov ) by 0.5@xmath11 , allowing for simultaneous source and background measurements @xcite .
the offset direction cycles between north , south , east and west for sequential observing segments to reduce systematic effects . after filtering the data for contamination due to poor weather or instrumental problems , 304 minutes of live time remained from the original 335 minutes of observations , see table  1 .    to test the improved reconstruction technique discussed in section [ sec : two reconstruction methods ] ,
veritas observations of the crab nebula were also analyzed .
we selected 203 minutes of good time intervals from 17 data segments taken on the crab nebula during 2010 march 1216 ( mjd 5526755271 ) with similar zenith angles ranging from @xmath12 to @xmath13 .
all data were analyzed using the standard analysis package for veritas data @xcite .
the raw data were calibrated and cleaned , and quality selection criteria based on the number of photomultiplier tubes contained in the images and the position of the image in the camera were applied .
the shape and orientation of the gamma - ray images were parametrized by their principal moments @xcite . in order to produce gamma - ray images of the sky ,
it is necessary to reconstruct the putative source location for each shower in the camera plane ( hereafter  arrival direction ' ) .
when imaging showers with multiple iacts , the arrival direction of a shower is usually found using simple geometric arguments .
the major axes of the images produced by a shower in each iact camera intersect near the location of the arrival direction .
the shower arrival direction is calculated by minimizing the perpendicular distance to each image s semi - major axis , weighted by the size of each image .
this method , here called the standard method , is effective at small zenith angles .
however , at lza , the major axes of the air shower images from an individual gamma - ray event are generally close to parallel .
thus , the uncertainty of the intersecting point increases , resulting in a loss of angular resolution . due to this effect , a reconstruction technique that does not depend on the intersection of the axes is desirable for lza observations .
the displacement method is a direction reconstruction algorithm that is useful for lza observations @xcite . in very general terms
, it consists of calculating the arrival direction using the shape and brightness of a given air shower image .
more specifically , it relies on the determination of the _ disp _ parameter , defined as the angular distance from the image centroid to the arrival direction .
this method was used by several experiments in the past  @xcite , with varying ways of calculating _
disp_.    the basis of the displacement method is the relationship of the _ disp _ parameter to other image parameters  @xcite .
the implementation of the algorithm in veritas is as follows : we estimate _ disp _ as a function of three other image parameters , _ size _ , _ length _ and _ width _
@xcite , using monte carlo simulated gamma - ray showers .
the method results in two different arrival directions , one on each side of a telescope image along the semi - major axis , also known as head - tail ambiguity  @xcite .
this ambiguity is eliminated by choosing the cluster of arrival directions closest to one another , one coming from each image .
finally , the arrival direction is estimated independently for each telescope image and an average weighted by _
size _ is taken .
this method proves to be more powerful than the standard method  @xcite when reconstructing events with zenith angle larger than @xmath9 .
quantitatively , an improvement of @xmath1430% in detection significance for a source having 1% of the strength of the crab nebula has been observed .
the cosmic ray background rate for iacts is typically more than @xmath15 times the gamma ray rate , so it is important to reduce this background while retaining as many gamma - ray events as possible . by exploiting the differences in the development of gamma ray and cosmic ray
induced showers , the background due to cosmic rays can be reduced significantly , while still retaining a high fraction of gamma - ray like events .
the background reduction is performed by placing standard selection criteria , optimized using monte carlo simulations and real data from the crab nebula on the shower image parameters .
the selection criteria for the size of the telescope images , the mean scaled width and mean scaled length parameters @xcite , the height of maximum cherenkov emission and the angular distance from the anticipated source location to the reconstructed arrival direction of each shower ( @xmath16 ) are given in table [ cuts ] .    to perform a background subtraction of the surviving cosmic ray events , an estimation of these background counts
is made using the reflected - region background model @xcite .
events within an angular distance @xmath16 of the anticipated source location are considered on events .
background measurements ( off events ) are taken from regions of the same size and at the same angular distance from the center of the fov .
for this analysis , a minimum of eight background regions was used .
the excess number of events from the anticipated source location is found by subtracting the number of off events ( scaled by the relative exposure , @xmath17 ) from the on events .
statistical significances are calculated using a modified version of eqn .
17 of @xcite to allow for varying number of off - source regions due to nearby star 60 cygni @xcite .
more details about veritas , the calibration procedure and the analysis techniques can be found in @xcite .
analysis of the veritas data did not show a significant detection at the location of v407 cyg .
the results from both event reconstruction methods were used to calculate upper limits on the flux from v407 cyg with the method described by @xcite and the assumption of a gaussian - distributed background .
the upper limits for v407 cyg are calculated at the decorrelation energies of 1.8 tev for the standard method and 1.6 tev for the displacement method and assume that any emission takes the form of a power law with a photon index of -2.5 . the decorrelation energy is the energy at which the dependence of the upper limit calculation on the assumed photon index is minimized .
this energy is found by performing multiple upper limit calculations , with different spectral indices , and determining the region where the resulting upper limit functions intersect .
the energy threshold for the observations of v407 cygni with veritas , defined as the maximum of the product of the assumed spectral shape and the effective area , is 1.2 tev for both methods .
the analysis results for v407 cyg are presented in table [ results ] and figure [ fig : mapfermi ] .
in addition , results from observations of the crab nebula at similar zenith angles are presented in table [ results ] and figure [ fig : mapcrab ] .
the efficiency of the displacement method for event reconstruction can be observed in the increase in both gamma - ray rate and significance for the crab measurements .
the increased sensitivity also results in a reduction of the upper limit for v407 cyg compared to the standard method .
the gev detection of v407 cyg provides evidence for previously unobserved gamma - ray emission from novae in white dwarf / red giant systems . expanding shock waves
have been known to accelerate particles to high energies , and gamma rays are observed from supernova remnants .
the discovery by the _
fermi_-lat team , however , suggests that the same phenomenon occurs in some novae , adding a new class of gamma - ray emitting objects .
the lack of a significant detection in the vhe band suggests that either particles were not accelerated to sufficient energies to produce vhe photons during the v407 cyg outburst or that vhe photons were produced , but then absorbed .
the key to creating gamma rays is the acceleration of sufficiently energetic charged particles . in the case of v407 cyg ,
the expanding matter from the nova collides with the stellar wind from the red giant and causes a shock , which accelerates the particles near the shock to relativistic energies .
a rough estimation for the maximum energy attainable by first order fermi acceleration of a particle at a shock can be found , following the discussion of @xcite . if @xmath18 is the magnetic flux density where a shock proceeds and the shock travels with velocity @xmath19 , the maximum energy of a particle with charge @xmath20 is @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the time allowed for particle acceleration .
this means that the highest attainable energy is proportional to the magnetic field in which the nova travels , the square of shock speed and the time for acceleration .
the mean magnetic field in the shock can be estimated as @xmath23^\frac{1}{2}$ ] , where @xmath24 is the density of gas molecules with respect to the distance from the center of the red giant and t is the wind temperature @xcite .
we assume a wind temperature of t=700k , corresponding to the temperature of the dust envelope measured by @xcite . @xcite
were able to directly measure the temperature of the red giant wind in a similar symbiotic system , eg and , and found that it can reach @xmath148000 k near the red giant . using
this wind temperature would increase the estimate for maximum particle energy by a factor of three .
@xcite carried out detailed hydrodynamic simulations of the v407 cyg nova with various gas distribution models and could accurately reproduce the x - ray light curve of v407 cygni .
their model for the distribution of gas that best reproduced the light curve included what they call a  circumbinary density enhancement , ' a region of density exceeding the typical @xmath25 profile of the stellar wind in the binary system , and had a binary separation of 15.5 au @xcite . for the temporal profile of the nova shock velocity
, we used the equation that @xcite found from fits to the broad components of the h@xmath17 spectra they measured beginning at day 2.3 after the outburst ( 13 march 2010 ) and thereafter : @xmath26 . for the velocity between day 0 and day 2 of the outburst
, we can assume two cases that bound the possible velocity profiles : i ) the nova shell experienced free expansion at a constant velocity before day 2 , with the assumption that the mass collected by the nova shell during this period was small ( free expansion model ) or ii ) extrapolate the above equation for the velocity to times before day 2 ( extrapolation model ) .
we then find that at the start of veritas observations of v407 cyg ( day 9 of the outburst ) , @xmath27 tev for the free expansion model and @xmath28 tev for the extrapolation model .
this suggests that particles could have been accelerated to tev energies by the time of the veritas observations .    to check the importance of absorption
, we calculated the opacity along the photon path for gamma rays generated at the shock front .
electron - positron pair production via photon - photon collision is the dominant interaction @xcite .
we modeled the red giant spectrum as a blackbody with a temperature of 2500  k and a radius of 500  @xmath29 , found the photon density as a function of position and energy following @xcite , and used the cross section for the photon - photon collision from @xcite .
we found that the opacity for tev photons only becomes significant when the tev emission region is located directly behind the red giant with the system viewed edge on . though this case can not be ruled out , it is statistically unlikely .
in addition , if the suggested orbital parameters of @xcite are accurate , the system is unlikely to have been in such an orientation at the time of the nova .
the upper limits placed by veritas can put some restrictions on the gamma - ray emission mechanism in v407 cyg .
two physical models of gamma - ray production at the shock - front have been suggested @xcite . in the hadronic model , gamma rays
are produced in the decay of @xmath30 particles generated by collisions of high energy protons accelerated in the shock . in the leptonic model , gamma rays
are produced via inverse - compton scattering of infrared photons emitted from the red giant on high energy electrons accelerated in the shock .
the electron threshold energy for production of a gamma - ray photon via inverse - compton scattering off the red giant photons can be estimated as : @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the electron threshold energy , @xmath33 is the gamma - ray energy and @xmath34 is the energy of the red giant photons .
the electron threshold energy for a 1  tev gamma ray scattering off 0.6 ev photons at the peak of the red giant spectrum is 1.1  tev .
though the above calculation indicates that particles could reach tev energies if continuously accelerated for the full nine days from the initial outburst to the start of the veritas observations , the inverse - compton cooling time would be significantly less than a day ( the time estimated by @xcite for 5 gev electrons ) , meaning electrons that are accelerated in the first few days of the outburst would not likely retain sufficient energy to produce vhe photons by the time of the veritas observations .
vhe emission near the time of the veritas observations would therefore require freshly accelerated particles , however , recently accelerated particles would likely not have enough time to reach tev energies .
if electrons did reach tev energies , they would be approaching the klein - nishina regime , where the cross section for inverse - compton scattering would be reduced , resulting in a longer cooling time .
however , electrons with tev energies would be well above the exponential cutoff , @xmath35  gev , of the electron spectrum in the best - fit leptonic model of @xcite .
these two factors imply that the veritas upper limits place no new constraints on leptonic models .
for hadronic models , the _ fermi_-lat data alone provide relatively poor constraints on the extension of the proton spectrum to high energies .
in particular , the cutoff energy @xmath36 is not well bounded from above if the spectral index is steep .
the veritas data can be used to improve the constraints on the hadronic model parameters . to do so
, we re - fit the hadronic model used by @xcite to the _
fermi_-lat points with the addition of the veritas upper limit .
figure  [ fig : spectrum ] shows the _
fermi_-lat data @xcite and the veritas flux upper limit compared to the best fitting hadronic model .
the gamma - ray spectrum is calculated via the method of @xcite , assuming a cosmic proton spectrum of the following form : @xmath37 ( protons  gev@xmath38 ) , where ( @xmath39 are kinetic energy , cut - off energy , and mass of the proton and @xmath40 is the power law index ) .
figure  [ fig : revisedmap ] shows a confidence region map for the parameters of the hadronic model using both the _ fermi_-lat and veritas data .
the gamma - ray spectrum was modeled as described above and fitted to the _
fermi_-lat data by varying @xmath40 and @xmath41 .
the spectrum was then compared to the veritas upper limit , and a @xmath42 value for the veritas data point alone was calculated . specifically , we calculated the model flux in the veritas energy band and compared this to the flux upper limit determined via the displacement method .
this @xmath42 value was then added to the @xmath42 calculated for the _
fermi_-lat data .
the confidence levels were then calculated for the two parameters of interest , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .
as can be seen from figure  [ fig : revisedmap ] , the veritas observations place greater restrictions on the model proton spectral index for high cutoff energies .
the 90% confidence limits are @xmath43 5 tev ( comparable to @xmath44 tev , calculated above for the extrapolation model ) and @xmath45 0.01 tev ( much lower than @xmath46 ) .
it is possible that the peak energy of the particles produced by the shock could be reduced if the magnetic field is weaker than estimated above .
@xcite argue for a larger binary separation of 2025 au , based on the presence of lithium burning in the mira , and evidence that the white dwarf in the system is massive . using this larger separation distance
would lead to weaker magnetic fields .
the limits placed by the veritas observations are near the threshold for the observations , so it is also possible that simply not enough particles were accelerated to high enough energies to produce a significant detection by veritas .

 observations were made with the very energetic radiation imaging telescope array system during 2010 march 1926 at relatively large zenith angles , due to the position of v407 cyg . 
 an improved reconstruction technique for large zenith angle observations is presented and used to analyze the data . 
 we do not detect v407 cygni and place a differential upper limit on the flux at 1.6  tev of @xmath1 ( at the 95% confidence level ) . 
 when considered jointly with data from _ fermi_-lat , this result places limits on the acceleration of very high energy particles in the nova . "
"lisa ( laser interferometer space antenna ) is a space mission of nasa and esa which aims at detecting low frequency gravitational waves .
lisa will consist in a constellation of three spacecraft occupying the vertexes of an equilateral triangle of side 5 million kilometers .
the barycenter of the constellation will orbit around the sun following a quasi - circular orbit inclined @xmath0 with respect to the ecliptic , and trailing the earth by some @xmath1 .
each of the spacecraft harbors two proof masses , carefully protected against external disturbances such as solar radiation pressure and charged particles , which ensures they are in nominal free - fall in the interplanetary gravitational field .
gravitational waves show up as differential accelerations between pairs of proof masses , and the main aim of lisa is to measure such acceleration using laser interferometry .
the interested reader is referred to  @xcite and  @xcite for more extensive information .
the technologies required for the lisa mission are many and challenging .
this , coupled with the fact that some flight hardware can not be tested on ground , led esa to frame within its scientific program a technology demonstrator to test the required critical technologies in a flight environment .
its launch is expected towards early 2014 .
the basic goal of lisa pathfinder consists in measuring to the highest possible accuracy the acceleration noise of two test masses 35 centimeters away , and to keep this noise below a certain limit  @xcite .
the payload on board lisa pathfinder is called the lisa technology package ( ltp )  @xcite .
its main components are the two gravitational reference sensors ( grss )  shown as the two large vertical cylinders in figure  [ fig.ltp ]  and the optical metrology system ( oms )  which is an interferometer placed on the horizontal platform between them .
the grs consists in a set of electrodes aimed to determine the position of a test mass with respect to the spacecraft to nanometer precision , using capacitance measurements .
the oms provides picometer precision measurements of the relative position of two test masses . using these measurements , a set of micro - thrusters
 field emission electric propulsion ( feep )  relocate the spacecraft so that the test mass preserves a free fall motion . in the same figure  [ fig.ltp ] , the location of two induction coils can be observed .
the coils will be used to generate a controlled magnetic field within the volume of the ltp core assembly ( lca ) in such a way that the magnetic characteristics of the test masses can be determined . at the same time
, the magnetic field inside the lca will be measured by a set of four tri - axial fluxgate magnetometers ( not shown in the figure ) .
all these pieces of hardware constitute the magnetic diagnostic subsystem . finally , the data management unit ( dmu ) is in charge of commanding and acquiring signals from all the mentioned subsystems .
magnetic noise in the ltp can be a significant part of the total readout noise , 1.2@xmath210@xmath3ms@xmath4hz@xmath5 out of 3.0@xmath210@xmath3ms@xmath4hz@xmath5 is the allocated maximum acceleration magnetic noise budget .
this noise occurs because the residual magnetization and susceptibility of the proof masses couple with a surrounding magnetic field , giving rise to a force @xcite :    @xmath6{\bf b }             \right\rangle v\ , ,   \label{eq.1}\ ] ]    and a torque :    @xmath7   \right\rangle v   \label{eq.1n}\ ] ]    in these expressions * b * is the magnetic field in the test mass , * m * stands for the magnetization of the test mass , @xmath8 is the volume of the test mass , @xmath9 is its magnetic susceptibility , @xmath10 is the vacuum magnetic constant , and * r * denotes the distance to the center of the test mass .
finally , the notation @xmath11 refers to the volume average of the enclosed quantity .
thus , to estimate and ultimately subtract the acceleration noise due to the magnetic interactions , the magnetic properties of the test masses must be determined .    in this paper
we describe the experimental setup and the data analysis needed to infer the values of the magnetic properties of the test masses on board the ltp , and we assess the feasibility of obtaining the magnetic characteristics of the test masses with good accuracy .
specifically , we present a set of simulations aimed at evaluating the response of the ltp hardware ( coils and test masses ) and control architecture ( drag free controllers and low frequency suspension controllers ) when a controlled magnetic field is applied .
we will show that using this procedure , both the magnetization and the magnetic susceptibility of the proof masses can be determined to the desired accuracy .
the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : experiment ] , we describe the main elements of the experimental setup .
section [ sec : forces ] is devoted to compute the forces and torques acting on the test masses .
it follows section [ sec : noisesources ] , where the different noise sources perturbing the experiment are presented .
finally , in section [ sec : results ] we present our results , whereas in section [ sec : conclusions ] we summarize our main findings and we present our conclusions .
as mentioned , the basic approach to determine the magnetic properties of the test masses is to inject a controlled signal with the onboard coils and to study the dynamics of the proof masses .
the two test masses are located at the center of each inertial sensor , and are the end mirrors of the oms .
in fact , one of the test masses will be the reference free floating body to perform the translation control of the spacecraft .
the test masses are made of an alloy of pt ( 27% ) and au ( 73% ) , their dimensions are @xmath12 mm and their weight is 1.95 kg . to comply with the top science requirements ,
the test masses must have certain properties .
for the purpose of the present paper the two most important ones are the magnetic moment and the susceptibility , which must be , respectively , @xmath13  a  m@xmath14 and @xmath15 @xcite .
the volume of the test masses is @xmath16  m@xmath17 .
the density of magnetic moment has to be then @xmath18  a / m .        the controlled magnetic field will be produced by the onboard coils , which are placed next to each of the grs towers  see fig .
[ fig.ltp ] .
the two circular induction coils are made of a titanium alloy ( @xmath19 ) , have @xmath20 2400 windings of radius @xmath21 mm .
they are placed 85.5 mm away from the center of the respective test mass .
the onboard coils are aligned with the @xmath22-axis of the test masses , thus , the magnetic field within the volume of the test masses has axial symmetry , see fig .  [ fig.coils ] .
if the current fed to the coils is @xmath23 , the resulting magnetic field ( and its gradient ) will oscillate at the same frequency .
thus , when the coils are switched on the test masses rotate and are displaced from their equilibrium positions .
typical values of @xmath24 and @xmath25 are , respectively , 1  ma and 1  mhz .    compared to other missions ,
ltp is a very flexible instrument in terms of the possible operation scenarios .
nevertheless , we characterize the magnetic experiment for a fixed operating mode , the main science mode  @xcite .
this mode is a full 3-dimensional dynamical mode and it is schematically shown in fig .
[ fig.control ] .
@xmath26 is a dynamical matrix which represents the dynamic response of the spacecraft and the test masses when they are affected by specific forces ( @xmath27 ) .
this block consists of an 18 degree - of - freedom representation of the motion of these 3 bodies .
the differential position of the test masses and their distance to the spacecraft are represented by @xmath28 in this block - diagram .
the ltp is endowed with two different mechanisms to detect the motion and the actual position of the test masses .
the first one is the interferometer , while the second is the electrode housing of each of the two gravitational reference sensors .
the oms in ltp is in charge of measuring the distance between one of the test masses and the optical bench , thus giving an absolute reference , and also the distance between both test masses , providing a differential reading . due to its ability to perform wavefront sensing , the rotation angles of the test mass around the @xmath29- ( @xmath30 ) and @xmath31-axis ( @xmath32 ) can also be measured ( the @xmath29- and @xmath31-axis in the test mass coordinate frame are the same axis represented in fig .  [ fig.coils ] but centered at the test mass ) .
the displacements are expected to be measured with a picometer accuracy while the rotation angles can be measured with an accuracy of @xmath33 nrad  @xcite .
the electrode housing can also be used to determine the position of the test masses .
however , this mechanism only offers readings with nanometer precision .
consequently , for our application only the readings of the interferometer will be used .
the physical model of these sensing mechanisms is included in @xmath34 , the sensing matrix ( figure [ fig.control ] ) .
@xmath35 is the readout noise of the different sensors and @xmath36 the actual measure delivered to the controller
.     stands for the dynamical matrix , @xmath37 represents the sensing matrix of the interferometer , i.e. the matrix translating the position of the test mass , @xmath28 , into the interferometer readout , @xmath38 ( @xmath39 stands for the readout noise ) .
@xmath40 represents the physics of the feeps and the electrostatic actuators , and finally @xmath41 , is the controller matrix , implementing the drag free and low - frequency control loops .
@xmath42 represents the displacement guidance signals .
@xmath43 are the actuators noise and @xmath44 are the output forces of the actuators .
@xmath45 are the magnetic forces induced by the coils and @xmath46 are the environment force noises disturbing the spacecraft.,scaledwidth=49.0% ]    these kinematic measurements are processed by the controller block ( @xmath47 ) and a feedback action is produced on the ltp dynamics by the actuators ( @xmath40 ) : the micropropulsion thrusters and the electrostatic actuators .
they produce an additional set of forces ( @xmath48 ) with the following objectives . the drag free controller acts on the spacecraft using the micropropulsion thrusters and forces it to follow test mass 1 .
the electrostatic actuators act on test mass 2 using the low frequency suspension , a specific control loop of very low gain in the ltp measurement bandwidth , that allows to control in band the differential acceleration between both test masses at the same time , avoiding secular drifts or stray motions of the second test mass .
finally , @xmath49 represents the force noise on the test masses , and @xmath45 represents the forces acting on the test masses due to the magnetic field created by the coils .
the complete control architecture can be expressed by the following system of equations :    @xmath50    where all the symbols have been already defined with the only exception of @xmath51 which represents the displacement guidance signals of the experiment and @xmath52 which are the actuators noise . using eqs .
( [ eq.control ] ) , we can calculate the transfer function from the magnetic forces ( @xmath53 ) to the interferometer readings ( @xmath36 ) , which turns out to be :    @xmath54    this transfer function characterizes the projection of the magnetic forces / torques into kinematic motion of the test masses .
the controllers have been designed to deliver very sensitive readings of the differential motion of both test masses between 1mhz and 30mhz , the measurement bandwidth of the ltp mission . for simplicity , if we consider only the one - dimensional model :    @xmath55    where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the stiffness parameters coupling the motion of each test mass to the motion of the spacecraft , @xmath58 is the interferometer channel crosscoupling . @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the drag free and the low frequency suspension controller transfer functions respectively and , finally , @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the physical models for the feep thrusters and the electrostatic actuators .
using eq .  ( [ eq.1 ] ) and neglecting the environmental field ( which is much smaller than the applied field , 500 nt ) , the @xmath22-component of the force acting on the test mass is    @xmath63     and @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 . for this specific example
we have adopted @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 ( a random orientation of the maximum * m * ) and @xmath70 .
@xmath24 is 1ma and @xmath25 is 1mhz .
the @xmath22-component of the force is shown as a solid black line , whereas the @xmath29-component is displayed as a dashed - dotted red line and the @xmath31-component is displayed as dashed green line.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    where * b*@xmath71 is the field produced by the coils .
thus , since @xmath72 , the linear acceleration of the test masses has two separate frequencies , one at @xmath25 and the other one at @xmath73 , and also a dc component . the force on test mass 1 is plotted in figure [ fig.force ] .
the torque acting on the test mass also has a similar behavior .
however , it must be noted that , because of the symmetry of the applied magnetic field , the torque only has one frequency component :    @xmath74    \right\rangle v\,\sin\omega t   \label{eq.torques}\ ] ]    the resulting torques are displayed in figure [ fig.torque ] .
it is important to realize that only the @xmath29- and @xmath31-components of the torque can be measured with the interferometer , as @xmath75 produces a rotation around the direction of the laser beam .
moreover , decomposing eqs .
( [ eq.forces ] ) and ( [ eq.torques ] ) , it is easy to show that the @xmath22-component of the force on the test mass ( which can be obtained from its displacement ) and the @xmath29- and @xmath31-components of the torque ( which can be obtained from the rotation angles ) can be cast in the form :    @xmath76    where @xmath77 is a constant function , @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 oscillate at @xmath25 and @xmath81 oscillates at @xmath73 .
hence , @xmath82 and @xmath83 will be used to estimate @xmath66 and @xmath65 , respectively , while the differential displacement of the test masses will be used to measure @xmath64 and  @xmath9 .    .
the @xmath22- , @xmath29- and @xmath31-components of the torque are shown using black solid , red dashed - dotted and green dashed lines , respectively.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]
the forces and torques shown in figures [ fig.force ] and [ fig.torque ] correspond to an ideal case . however , the real forces and torques acting on the test masses will not be noise - free .
additionally , the outputs detected by the interferometer will also be affected by several noise sources .
thus , to assess the feasibility of the experiment we need to model the noise sources .
this is precisely the aim of this section .
the stability of the magnetic field ( @xmath84 ) produced by the coils at the position of the test masses and its gradient ( @xmath85 ) must be , respectively , better than 5  nt  hz@xmath5 and 12  nt  m@xmath86  hz  @xmath5 @xcite within the measurement bandwidth ( 1  mhz @xmath87 30  mhz ) .
this can be translated into a requirement on the stability of the injected current .
it turns out that the requirement on the magnetic field gradient is the more demanding one , and using ampere s law it is straightforward to show that it is equivalent to a current fluctuation ( @xmath88 ) requirement of 110  na  hz@xmath5 within the measurement bandwidth .        in figure  [ fig.curr.source ]
, we show a block diagram of the different hardware stages used to produce the current that feeds the coils .
this block diagram has two parts : a digital - to - analog processing stage and an analog processing stage .
the first block contains two digital - to - analog converters ( dac ) , followed by transresistance amplifiers ( i / v ) delivering low impedance output voltages .
the first dac sets the reference voltage of the second dac and thus the peak amplitude of the sinusoidal current applied to the coil .
the second one is configured with bipolar operation to generate the quantized signal with the previously selected amplitude . in the analog processing block
the signal is low - pass - filtered and amplified with a howland current source  @xcite .
finally , a switch is used to select one of the three possible states : short - circuit , open - circuit or connected .
the noise of the current source chain for a dc signal , @xmath89 , can be written as :    @xmath90^{1/2}\ ] ]    where @xmath91 is the noise density of the voltage reference and the first dac , @xmath92 is the noise density of the transimpedance amplifier and the second dac , @xmath93 is the noise density of the transimpedance amplifier , low - pass filter and howland current source , and @xmath94 and @xmath95 are , respectively , the gains in the the second and third stages . the noise density of the first stage can be obtained as a contribution of the first dac , @xmath96 , and of the reference voltage , @xmath97 . however , the noise contribution of the first dac is negligible with respect to that of the reference source , @xmath98 . thus , if the dac works at its full scale , @xmath99 .
likewise , @xmath92 can be computed as a combination of two different sources @xmath100 and @xmath101 , being @xmath100 the noise density of the second dac and @xmath102 that of the transresistance amplifiers , and finally @xmath103 , where @xmath104 and @xmath105 are , respectively , the noise densities of the low - pass filter and of the howland current source .
these noise sources have been measured for a dc current of 1  ma .
the values obtained are @xmath106 , @xmath107 , and @xmath108 , respectively .
the details of how these measurements were done are out of the scope of this paper and will be provided elsewhere .
however , we mention that although the previous analysis has been performed for dc currents , when we operate at 1  mhz the dominant noise source is the quantization noise of the second dac .
this means that the total current noise can be modeled as :    @xmath109^{1/2}\ ] ]    where the sole contributor is the quantization noise of the second stage , and thus the total noise assuming an uniform quantization and a signal amplitude greater than a quantization step is given by :    @xmath110    where @xmath111 is the sampling frequency , @xmath112 is the number of bits of the onboard hardware , and the rest of the symbols have been already defined .
the dmu delivers the output at a rate of 1024 samples per cycle .
thus , the 1  mhz sinusoidal signal will be sampled at a frequency @xmath113hz .
since the highest sinusoidal current used in the experiment will be 1ma , the highest noise will be 2.22  @xmath114 .
this noise is 2 orders of magnitude larger than all other contributions and therefore will be the dominant noise .
figure [ fig.accurrentstability ] shows the current noise for coil 1 for a signal of 1mhz and 1ma ( which are the nominal values of the experiment ) . as can be seen , the quantization noise level is above the dc current stability requirement for the mission ( dashed green line ) but , as it will be shown below , it is still sufficiently small to allow a reliable estimation of the magnetic properties of the test masses
. it is also interesting to note that the quantization noise ( thus the total noise ) can be reduced when a 16-bit dac is used  see eq .
( [ quant ] ) .
finally , note that our theoretical results nicely match the experimental results .
sinusoidal current of 1  @xmath115 nominal frequency .
the dotted blue line shows the measured noise density , whereas the solid black line is our theoretical estimate ( see text for details ) .
the green dashed line represents the dc current fluctuations requirement.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]      so far we have discussed the noise density of the onboard coils .
however , the different electronic subsystems of the satellite produce magnetic fields , which are also noisy . the magnetic noise produced by these subsystems ( @xmath116 )
has been modeled considering the fluctuating values of their magnetic moments  @xcite .
the expected displacement noise spectral density at the positions of the test masses due to the magnetic field generated by several electronic boxes is 3 @xmath2 10@xmath117 m  hz@xmath5 at 1mhz .
other noise sources that affect the measurements are the readout noise of the oms , the noise induced by the grs and that of the star tracker .
as already mentioned , we only use the readings of the interferometer .
however , the control chain uses the readings of the inertial sensors and of the star tracker to stabilize the drag free motion and the satellite attitude .
therefore , both the grs and the star tracker affect the readings of the oms , and must be considered .
the dominant noise is the readout noise in displacement of the interferometer . we model it using a two pole / two zero noise shape filter  @xcite :    @xmath118    at the positions of the test masses this results in a low frequency displacement noise of around 5 @xmath2 10@xmath117  m  hz@xmath5 at 1mhz but it is the largest contributor at high frequency .
the actuators are also a relevant noise source at low frequencies .
this noise is due to the capacitive actuators and the feep thrusters which have to ensure the free fall motion of the test mass .
the micro - propulsion system of lisa pathfinder is composed of 12 feep thrusters .
the force noise of each individual thruster is modeled as  @xcite :    @xmath119    their contribution in the differential readout channel is around 2 @xmath2 10@xmath120 m  hz@xmath5 at 1mhz , and it is somewhat larger on the absolute channel ( which provides the distance from test mass 1 to the spacecraft ) where the feep thrusters are the main disturbance source  @xcite .
solar and infrared disturbances have been also modeled .
solar disturbances are due to the solar flux impacting on the surfaces of the spacecraft .
infrared disturbances are due to the infrared emission from the spacecraft external surfaces .
these two noise sources are the most important contributors of disturbance on the spacecraft coordinates but they are highly attenuated by the control architecture and they turn out to be completely negligible in the interferometer readings .
finally , the test mass disturbance noise represent the internal disturbances at the test mass coordinates .
they are expected to be the most relevant sources at low frequency on the interferometer readings and their contribution has been estimated to be @xmath121  m  hz@xmath5 at 1  mhz .
all these sources of noise affect the quality of the estimate of the magnetic properties of the test masses , as it will be shown below .
we have estimated the magnetic properties of the test masses using the readings provided by the mission telemetry .
the telemetry corresponding to the magnetic experiments will consist of the commands sent to the coils , the displacement readings of the interferometer ( namely , the absolute and differential readings ) and the wavefront rotation readings about the @xmath29- ( @xmath30 ) and @xmath31- axes ( @xmath32 ) . for simplicity
, we have assumed that the stiffness of the test masses , the actuators gains and the interferometer crosscoupling factors have already been determined  @xcite .
the simulated displacements and rotations measured by the onboard interferometer are displayed in figure [ fig.displacement ] .
these displacements and rotations have been obtained integrating the equations of motion of a rigid solid , and including the drag free and low frequency controllers  see sect .
[ sec : experiment ] . note that the problem has 18 degrees of freedom .
in particular , each of the two test masses has 6 degrees of freedom , and the spacecraft also has 6 degrees of freedom .
the closed loop simulation is performed with appropriate simulation tools that will be used for mission operations  @xcite . as can be seen ,
the displacements of the test masses are below 8 nm , while in permanent regime the corresponding rotations have amplitudes of @xmath122rad .
the very long transient of about 3000s of the rotation excusions  see the bottom panel of figure [ fig.displacement ]  is due to the effect of the low - frequency controller .
this controller is designed to avoid drift excursions of the test masses with frequencies smaller than 1mhz .
consequently , the transient is very long . a similar transient ,
although less evident , is present in the differential reading  see the top panel of figure [ fig.displacement ] .
the reading of the displacement channel has two frequency components , @xmath25 and @xmath73 , however , these components are difficult to see in the time series shown in figure  [ fig.displacement ] .
additionally , these two components are not in phase with the forces shown in figure  [ fig.force ] because the lpf dynamics and the controllers introduce a phase delay to each of the two components .
finally , it is worth mentioning that these displacements and rotations are within acceptable margins because they do not exceed the authority limits of the drag free and low - frequency controllers .

this figure has been obtained simulating the output of the entire instrument for each of the noise sources presented previously in sect .
[ sec : noisesources ] .
we simulated 100000 seconds for each source of noise .
then , we performed the spectral estimation with a smoothed power spectral estimator based on the welch estimator using a blackman - harris window  @xcite .
the time domain simulation and the spectral analysis have been performed using the ltpda toolbox @xcite .
this is the data analysis tool that will be used for mission operations . as can be seen , in the frequency domain the signals at @xmath25 and @xmath73 are clearly visible .
note that the most important contribution is that of the sensors noise , which is mainly characterized by the high - frequency noise of the interferometer , the contribution of the feep thrusters and the disturbance noise of the test masses .
the environment noise , the magnetic hardware noise and of the solar and infrared emission contribution are totally negligible in the interferometer readings and do not represent any restriction in terms of parameter estimation quality .
we have already shown that the displacements and rotations of the test masses can be detected even in the case in which all the noise sources are considered . now
the question to be answered is to which accuracy the magnetic properties of the test masses can be estimated . to this end
we have used a classical linear least squares procedure  @xcite .
the magnetic parameters are estimated in the following way .
let @xmath128 be the differential displacement signals from the interferometer , and @xmath129 and @xmath130 the rotation excursions around the @xmath29- and the @xmath31-axis , respectively , we write then :    @xmath131    where we have used eq .
( [ eq.structure ] ) , @xmath132 and @xmath133 are the signals in displacement and rotation matched to the expected waveforms in @xmath25 and @xmath73 , as obtained from eq .
( [ eq.structure ] ) , and @xmath134 , @xmath135 and @xmath136 are the errors of the estimation model , namely , the displacement error , the @xmath30- and the @xmath32- error , respectively
. then the estimated magnetic properties of the test masses ( @xmath137 , @xmath138 , @xmath139 and @xmath140 ) applying least square techniques are computed as :    @xmath141^{-1 } \left (   \begin{array}{c } d_{{x_{1\omega } } } \\ d_{{x_{2\omega } } } \end{array}\right ) d_{x } \nonumber \\ \hat{m_z } & = & \left [ { r_{{y_{1\omega}}}}^{\rm t } \cdot r_{{y_{1\omega } } }   \right]^{-1 } { r_{{y_{1\omega}}}}^{\rm t } \cdot   r_{y } \\
\hat{m_y } & = & \left [ { r_{{z_{1\omega}}}}^{\rm t } \cdot r_{{z_{1\omega } } }   \right]^{-1 } { r_{{z_{1\omega}}}}^{\rm t } \cdot   r_{z } \nonumber \end{aligned}\ ] ]    as can be seen , the values of @xmath64 and @xmath9 must be disentangled from @xmath128 because the dynamics of the test masses show two frequencies , while @xmath129 and @xmath130 can be directly used to estimate the values of @xmath66 and @xmath65 .
we have examined the contribution of each of the noise sources in our estimation accuracy .
the accuracy of the measurements of the magnetic properties of the test masses is mainly affected by the specific contribution of the noise source within the measurement bandwith .
for instance , if some noise source has a relevant contribution around 1mhz in the rotation signals , the estimating algorithm can not disentangle this contribution from that of the injected torque . in table [ tab : estimation ] we list the accuracies of the estimated magnetic parameters obtained for each of the individual noise sources and that obtained when all the noise sources are present ( last row ) . rather naturally , the results for @xmath64 and @xmath9 shown in this table are closely related to the noise contributions shown in figure [ fig.noisebreakdown ]  note that figure  [ fig.noisebreakdown ] , only shows the noise breakdown for the differential displacement channel . the largest contribution to the error budget
are , as expected , the actuators noise , the interferometer noise and the test mass disturbances . nevertheless , the overall quality of the estimate is fairly good , 1.43% ( mean square error of the relative errors of all the estimated parameters ) .
it is interesting to note as well that even if the rotations signals present signal to noise ratios around a factor of 3 smaller , we obtain errors of the same order of magnitude for the estimates of @xmath65 and @xmath66 .
this stems from the fact that the signals from which they are obtained must not be disentangled .
in this paper we have confirmed the feasibility of deriving the magnetic properties of the test masses of lisa pathfinder .
the magnetic experiment is based on injecting controlled sinusoidal currents through the on - board coils and studying the dynamics of the test masses , as measured with the optical metrology subsystem . in our study
we have performed numerical calculations that incorporate a full model of the dynamics of the test masses , realistic noise sources and up - to - date simulations of the interferometer and inertial sensors . in particular , all the degrees of freedom of the test masses have been appropriately analyzed and we have fully taken into account the control architecture of lisa pathfinder . we have obtained that the displacements of the test masses along the @xmath22-direction are @xmath142 nm , while the rotation excursions are approximately @xmath143rad .
these findings confirm that the magnetic experiment is within the authority margins of the drag free and low frequency suspension controllers .
consequently , any damage to the entire experiment when the coils are excited can be safely discarded .
moreover , we have shown as well that the displacement and rotation signals can be processed and pipelined to an adequate estimation algorithm that allows to estimate both the magnetic moment and the magnetic susceptibility of the test masses to a good accuracy . specifically , assuming that the remnant magnetic moment is homogenous within the entire volume of the test masses , the estimates have errors below the 2% level .

 esa decided to launch a technological demonstrator , lisa pathfinder . 
 the payload of lisa pathfinder is the so - called lisa technology package , and will be the highest sensitivity geodesic explorer flown to date . the lisa technology package is designed to measure relative accelerations between two test masses in nominal free fall ( geodesic motion ) . 
 the magnetic , thermal and radiation disturbances affecting the payload are monitored and dealt by the diagnostics subsystem . 
 the diagnostics subsystem consists of several modules , and one of these is the magnetic diagnostics unit . 
 its main function is the assessment of differential acceleration noise between test masses due to the magnetic effects . 
 to do so , it has to determine the magnetic characteristics of the test masses , namely their magnetic remanences and susceptibilities . in this paper 
 we show how this can be achieved to the desired accuracy .    
 lisa pathfinder , magnetic characteristics , on - board instrumentation "
"the near - fields of photonic nanostructures are characterized by the six components of the electric and magnetic field of light .
thus , the complete understanding of those devices requires measuring of all these six components , the different components having different importance , depending on the specific device and its application @xcite . at optical frequencies , light interacts with natural materials mainly via its electric field @xcite .
therefore , probing the three electric field components is not only of primary importance , but also much easier than picking up the magnetic field components .
one of the most popular ways to do this is by snom . in this technique ,
a probe is positioned in the near - field of the structure and for a specific type of probe and measurement configuration , the electric field distribution can be imaged @xcite .
however , recently new classes of artificial materials , or so called metamaterials , were developed , for which the magnetic interaction with light becomes as important as the electric one @xcite . under these circumstances ,
both optical magnetic field sources and detectors are now required .
previously , we have shown that the coupling of a metal covered hollow - pyramid aperture probe to a plasmonic sample results in imaging of the lateral magnetic field distribution of the sample @xcite . in this paper
we suggest that the stand - alone probe can be considered as a tangential optical magnetic dipole source without the need to invoke the coupling to the sample . additionally , we suggest that the probe can be considered as a tangential optical magnetic field detector .
this allows us to substitute the probe in snom simulations by an effective magnetic dipole , which significantly decreases the calculation time and memory requirements .
our findings are theoretically justified and validated by numerical simulations of the stand - alone probe and the probe - sample interactions in plasmonic samples .
strong magnetic field contribution to the near - field images obtained on dielectric nanophotonic samples using similar type of probes ( matellized aperture optical fiber probes ) has recently been reported @xcite .
for the hollow - pyramid probes we use , the verification on other types of samples , such as the above mentioned dielectric samples , is currently in progress .
recently , also other types of aperture probes , namely , optical fiber aperture probes , were suggested for tangential magnetic field detectors @xcite . compared with the optical fiber probes , the hollow - pyramid probes we use @xcite are more robust ( a typical probe under normal operation can last several months ) and provide slightly higher resolution topography images of the sample together with the optical magnetic field image .
additionally , the hollow - pyramid probes allow operation in a broad range of wavelengths ( 500  nm to 1600  nm ) with negligible polarization effect on the transmitted light .
the drawback is that for metallic samples , a dielectric spacer is recommended on top of the sample to prevent direct ohmic contact between the metal coating of the probe and the sample in contact scanning mode .
first , we will discuss the underlying physics allowing the modelling of the hollow - pyramid probe by a tangential magnetic dipole .
second , we confirm by simulations that the electromagnetic fields of the probe are indeed resembling the ones of a lateral magnetic dipole .
then , we demonstrate that in a simulation describing the real experiment , in which the probe is scanned over a sample ( demonstrated for plasmonic bar ) , similar results are obtained when the probe is substituted by a lateral magnetic dipole .
finally , we experimentally show that the probe can reciprocally be used as a detector for the tangential magnetic field of light .
typically , in the near - field measurements , the probe can be approximated by a subwavelength object for which the optical properties are well known in order to facilitate the interpretation of the images and the simulations of the experiments .
for instance , dielectric and apertureless metallic scattering snom probes , which are used for imaging of the electric field of light are generally modelled as an electric point dipole , with a material and size dependent polarizability @xcite .
a split - ring probe has a strong magnetic dipole moment , normal to the sample surface @xcite .    here
, we propose that a sio@xmath1 hollow - pyramid metal coated aperture probe can be approximated by an @xmath2 dipole  a tangential ( lateral ) _ y_-polarized magnetic point dipole , where the _ y_-direction is perpendicular to the light polarization direction and to the light propagation direction ( figure [ figure31 ] ) .
the specific near - field probe investigated here consists of a hollow sio@xmath1 pyramid , coated with al , with a subwavelength ( 100  nm ) aperture at its apex ( figure [ figure31 ] a ) .
the structure of the probe was modelled following the information provided by the manufacturer ( materials used , layer thicknesses , cone angle , and aperture size  figure [ figure31 ] b ) @xcite .    to analyse the system , it is useful to simplify the aperture of the hollow - pyramid probe as an aperture in a flat infinitesimally thin perfectly conducting metal screen .
the latter is known as a bethe - bouwkamp aperture @xcite and it has been demonstrated that the transmitted light through such an idealized aperture is similar to the light emitted from a combination of a normal electric dipole and a tangential magnetic dipole @xcite .
the direction of the magnetic dipole is determined by the polarization of the incident light .
one can intuitively picture the situation as follows : the electromagnetic field of the incident light has to satisfy the boundary conditions at the interface between the air and the metal .
the general boundary conditions require that at the interface between two materials the tangential electric field e@xmath0 and the normal magnetic field h@xmath3 have to be continuous .
we are considering a perfect metal , which has infinite conductivity , zero skin depth and zero relaxation time , therefore , inside the metal both the magnetic and the electric fields have to be zero .
thus , the fulfilment of the above mentioned boundary condition requires that e@xmath0 and h@xmath3 components have to be zero also just outside the metal ( figure [ figure32 ] a ) .     and e@xmath3 dipoles .
( a ) the boundary conditions at the metal - air interface require the electric field to be perpendicular and the magnetic field to be parallel to the metal . in the vicinity of the hole , this results in the magnetic and electric field line distributions , hand - sketched in ( b ) .
the screening currents induced by the magnetic field of the incoming light are depicted in red.,scaledwidth=75.0% ]    due to the fact that we are considering a perfect conductor , which instantaneously reacts to the incoming electromagnetic wave , illumination with any frequency can be assumed as quasi - static . in the quasi - static case maxwell
s equations for the electric and the magnetic fields are decoupled and therefore the response of the metal to those fields can be treated separately . the physical mechanism for screening out the h@xmath3 component is the induction of screening currents ( red arrows , figure [ figure32 ] a ) in the metal by the oscillating magnetic field of the incoming light . respectively
, the oscillating electric field is inducing a redistribution of the free charge carriers in the metal to cancel out the e@xmath0 component . in figure [ figure32 ]
b we sketch the electric and magnetic field distributions in the vicinity of the planar aperture to illustrate our intuitive explanation .
rigorous calculations of those fields have been presented elsewhere @xcite .
we have justified that near the air - metal interface the dominant field components are h@xmath0 and e@xmath3 .
since the hole is small compared to the wavelength of the light , those components are also the main components present in the vicinity of the hole and respectively they are the main components transmitted through the hole , as illustrated in figure [ figure32 ] b. consequently , the radiation transmitted through the hole can be effectively represented by the radiation of an h@xmath0 and e@xmath3 dipoles .    in our configuration
the incident light is mostly perpendicular to the plane of the hole and the metal screen , thus , the e@xmath3 component is almost zero . if an e@xmath3 component is present , it will induce an effective e@xmath4 dipole . such a dipole does not emit radiation along the z - axis , where our detector is located in the currently used transmission configuration . therefore , even if it is present , this component will not contribute to the detected signal @xcite .
have shown that in a similar setup , by collecting the polarization resolved light in scattering configuration , the e@xmath3 and e@xmath0 components can also be measured . in principle , this should also be applicable for our setup . however in the current transmission configuration
we would expect our probe to behave only as a tangential magnetic dipole .    in practice
, the fine details in the probe structure may slightly modify the result of this idealized simplification and other field components might also get transmitted to some extend @xcite . therefore , the assumptions described above need further verification and validation by simulations and experiments .      in this section
we demonstrate that the simulated fields of the hollow - pyramid probe are indeed similar to the fields of an @xmath2 magnetic dipole .
the incident light is dominantly perpendicular to the hole of the probe , therefore the contribution from the e@xmath3 component is negligible .
( b ) the specific geometry of the real probe allows a dipolar charge polarization and eventual transmission of the e@xmath0 component .
the profiles are taken 10  nm above the aperture at @xmath5  =  1000  nm.,scaledwidth=75.0% ]    finite - difference time - domain ( fdtd ) simulations of the probe show that an incident _ x_-polarized plane wave generates the above discussed screening currents in the probe , illustrated with the red arrows in figure [ figure33 ] a. in turn , those currents induce an effective @xmath2 magnetic dipole , as discussed above for a bethe - bouwkamp aperture @xcite .
additionally , the fdtd simulation of the induced charges shows a dipolar charge polarization at the apex of the probe - figure [ figure33 ] b. this suggests that the specific probe geometry we use might still allow a certain transmission of the lateral electric field component @xmath6 @xcite .
therefore , to check which component is mainly transmitted through the probe and , respectively , by which dipole we can effectively substitute the probe , we compare the simulated probe fields with the simulated fields of those two , @xmath2 and @xmath6 , dipoles  figure [ figure34 ] for the _ x - y _ field profiles and figure [ figure35 ] for the _ x - z _ and _ y - z _ field profiles .
the close resemblance between the near - field of the probe and the @xmath2 dipole supports the idea that the probe can be modelled by an @xmath2 dipole .
the different electric and magnetic near - field components for the probe , as obtained from fdtd simulations , are shown in figure [ figure34 ] b. the electric and the magnetic field plots have a common color scale .
the probe boundaries are indicated by the dashed white lines .
the light incident on the probe is _
x_-polarized with wavelength @xmath5  =  1000  nm .
the profiles remain almost unchanged throughout a broad spectral range .
the _ x - y _ cross - sections are taken 30  nm below the aperture and 130  nm below the dipoles ( see horizontal white dashed lines in figure [ figure35 ] ) .
figure [ figure34 ] a shows the corresponding field components for a _
y_-polarized magnetic dipole ( h@xmath7 ) and figure [ figure34 ] c - for an _
x_-polarized electric dipole ( e@xmath8 ) .
the white dot corresponds to the position of the dipole source in the simulation .
the strong resemblance of the fields of the probe and the @xmath2 dipole indicates that , in the near - field region , the aperture - probe can be approximated by such an @xmath2 magnetic dipole . in contrast
, there is a significant difference in the near field distribution of certain components of the @xmath6 dipole , compared to the probe , particularly for the @xmath2 and the @xmath6 components .
the observation that the near - fields of the probe are similar to those of an @xmath2 dipole ( but not an @xmath6 dipole ) is also evident in the _ x - z _ and _ y - z _ cross - sections - figure [ figure35 ] .
the cross sections are taken through the aperture center at @xmath5  =  1000  nm .
the horizontal white dashed lines indicate the positions at which the _ x - y _ cross sections in figure [ figure34 ] were taken - 30  nm below the probe aperture and 130  nm below the dipoles .
only the non - zero field components are plotted in the figure .
the simulated profiles in this section are in agreement with results obtained for gold - coated tapered fiber tips @xcite , a planar bethe aperture @xcite and a hole in a metal film at thz frequencies @xcite .
we have now confirmed by simulations our initial assumption that the aperture probe generates strongly resembling electromagnetic fields to those of an @xmath2 dipole .
still , we need to verify that both the probe and the @xmath2 dipole couple similarly to a sample .
now we will show that the probe can be substituted by the @xmath2 dipole in a situation mimicking the experiment , _
i.e. _ where the probe is scanned over a photonic structure .
the sample we have chosen to demonstrate this consists of a plasmonic antenna gold bar .
first , we shortly describe the antenna and the plasmonic effects on it .
then , we will show that the excitation of the plasmon modes in the bar by scanning the probe gives similar results to the excitation of the plasmon modes by scanning an @xmath2 dipole over the bar .
thus , the probe can be modelled as an @xmath2 dipole source also regarding the way it couples to a plasmonic sample .
the investigated nanoantenna , as shown in figure [ figure31 ] a , consists of a 70  nm wide and 50  nm thick gold slab with a 30  nm thick sio@xmath1 capping layer @xcite .
this layer ensures in an experimental setting that the probe is not in direct conductive contact with the sample .
the nanoantenna is further supported by a sio@xmath1 substrate .
when such a bar is illuminated with light , a surface plasmon wave , _
i.e. _ a collective surface charge oscillation , is excited . by imposing reflecting boundaries , in this case by confining the plasmon waves in the antenna cavity
, standing wave - like fabry - prot resonances can be formed for certain excitation frequencies @xcite . these standing wave - like
charge oscillations are known as surface plasmon resonances ( spr ) .
the mode index @xmath9 is used to indicate the number of half plasmon wavelengths @xmath10 that fit the antenna cavity at resonance .
consequently , this corresponds to the number of nodes in the plasmon charge density oscillation .    to initiate this spr charge oscillation
, it suffices to disturb the charge equilibrium .
this can be achieved by plane wave illumination or by locally tapping into the electron gas , similar to throwing a stone in a pond .
efficient plasmon excitation , however , is only obtained at specific locations along the standing wave pattern , and intimately depends on the type of excitation source , _ i.e. _ , its field distribution near the nanoantenna .
since we have shown that the probe fields have a similar distribution as an @xmath2 dipole fields , we can expect that the probe and the @xmath2 dipole will excite the plasmon modes at the same locations along the bar .    as a measure for the excitation efficiency of the plasmon modes we calculated the absorption of the antenna while it is scanned by the probe and the @xmath2 and @xmath6 dipoles described above - figure [ figure36 ] .
indeed , the absorption profiles obtained with the probe ( b ) are similar to the ones obtained with an @xmath2 dipole ( a ) , while very different from the ones with the @xmath6 dipole ( c ) . from top to bottom
, the different panels show the absorption profiles for the different order plasmon modes of the bar at the corresponding resonance wavelengths .
x_-axis indicates the position of the probe along the bar and the _ y_-axis gives the corresponding absorption at each of the scanning positions .        in the so - build absorption profiles clear absorption peaks
are observed at certain positions - the positions where the corresponding plasmon mode is most efficiently excited .
it should be noted that the resonant wavelengths with and without the probe are different , since the proximity of the probe in the near - field of the sample is generating a red - shift in the plasmon resonance wavelengths @xcite . to facilitate the comparison of the modes
, we have normalized each of the modes for each of the sources separately . from the comparison it is clear that the position and shape of the absorption peaks is very similar for the probe and the @xmath2 dipole excitation .
the slight differences in the relative intensities and peak shapes is most probably due to the fact that the probe has finite dimensions , while the @xmath2 dipole is a point source .
additionally , weak contributions from other than @xmath2 field components transmitted through the probe , and , effectively inducing other dipole sources , might still be present .    on the contrary ,
the absorption profiles obtained by an @xmath6 dipole excitation ( figure [ figure36 ] c ) are notably different from the ones obtained by the probe .
the @xmath6 dipole clearly fails to properly reproduce the absorption behavior near the edges of the antenna .
thus , we can safely conclude that the plasmon antenna excitation by the probe can be successfully reproduced by substituting the probe with an @xmath2 magnetic dipole .
such a substitution is in practice very convenient , since the simulations using a single point @xmath2 dipole source are about 30 times faster and 2 times smaller in size than the ones with the probe .
the similarity in the plasmon excitation positions for the probe and for the @xmath2 dipole can be observed not only for the absorption profiles at the resonance wavelengths plotted in figure [ figure36 ] , but also for other wavelengths .
the absorption profiles in the wavelength range between 650  nm and 2000  nm are plotted in figure [ figure37 ] for the probe ( b ) and for the @xmath2 dipole ( a ) .
the scans are shown only for the left half of the bar for the dipole and right half of the bar for the probe to facilitate the comparison .
as shown in figure [ figure36 ] , the other halves have a symmetric profile .
x_-axis represents the probe position along the bar .
y_-axis corresponds to the excitation wavelength .
the wavelengths at which the scans in figure [ figure36 ] are shown are marked with a red line .
the color scale goes form blue ( low absorption ) through green and yellow to red ( high absorption ) .
=  1000  nm bar , excited by the probe ( b ) and the dipole ( a ) in a broad range of wavelengths .
the red lines indicate the plasmon modes resonant wavelengths for which the profiles in figure [ figure36 ] are plotted .
the black spots are drawn to highlight the positions of the absorption maxima in the probe scan.,scaledwidth=85.0% ]    at the positions along the bar ( _ x_-axis ) , where a certain plasmon mode is efficiently excited , the absorption of light with the corresponding wavelength ( _ y_-axis ) is increased - the color scale at those positions is going through green and yellow to red . for clarity , in the right panel the locations at which the plasmon modes are most efficiently excited are highlighted with black ellipses .
as expected , at shorter wavelengths more absorption maxima are observed , indicating the excitation of higher order modes in the bar . in this representation
it is again visible that the absorption profiles obtained with the probe can be reproduced by an @xmath2 dipole in terms of position and number of absorption maxima . as mentioned before , the near - field proximity of the probe results in a red - shift of the absorption resonances .
the validity of the substitution of the hollow - pyramid probe by a tangential magnetic dipole for scanning other types of samples , for example dielectric samples , is currently in progress .
analogous results have been reported in the literature for similar types of probes 
metallized optical fiber probes @xcite .
we have now shown that the hollow - pyramid snom probe can be effectively considered as an @xmath2 dipole source . as discussed in the introduction ,
not only sources , but also detectors of the magnetic field of light are needed . in the far - field , according to the reciprocity theorem , optical setups with inverted beam paths are equivalent @xcite . however , the validity of this theorem in the near - field is not a priori evident and it has to be explicitly demonstrated for the concrete setups @xcite .
below , we experimentally demonstrate that the inverted beam path schemes of the snom setup result in identical experimental images , which means that the hollow - pyramid probe can also be effectively used as an @xmath2 magnetic field detector .    in the illumination mode snom
, the incoming light is focused through the hollow - pyramid onto the pyramid s apex and the transmitted light is collected in the far field by a collection objective ( figure [ figure38 ] a ) . in the reciprocal configuration - collection mode ,
the nanorod is illuminated by a focused laser beam from the substrate side ( at normal incidence to the substrate ) and the light picked up through the probe is detected ( figure [ figure38 ] b ) .
we have carried out this experiment using a gold bar of length @xmath11  =  740  nm and with illumination wavelength @xmath5  =  785  nm .
the experimental transmission maps present the same characteristic features in both imaging modes - bottom panels in figure [ figure38 ] a and b. three dark regions corresponding to regions of plasmon mode excitation are observed , indicating the excitation of the third order antenna mode .
=  3 plasmon mode of a @xmath11  =  740  nm bar , illuminated at @xmath5  =  785  nm.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    we have demonstrated previously that the transmission image in illumination mode ( figure [ figure38 ] a ) corresponds to the @xmath2 magnetic field distribution @xcite . similarly , kihm et al .
@xcite have shown for surface plasmon polaritons on a gold film that the experimental images in collection mode ( with an optical fiber aperture probe ) also visualize the @xmath2 magnetic near - field . in collection mode
the image has a slightly reduced contrast , which might be due to slight misalignment  the alignment procedure is much more challenging from technical point of view .
thus , the observed similarity of the near field images in panels a and b indeed confirms the equivalence between illumination and collection modes and the detection of the @xmath2 magnetic field of light by aperture snom probes .
the equivalence between the reciprocal configurations of an aperture optical fiber type of snom has been reported elsewhere @xcite .
in conclusion , we suggest that the circular aperture at the apex of a metal coated hollow - pyramid snom probe can be approximated by a lateral magnetic dipole source and , reciprocally , lateral magnetic field detector .
this is illustrated by comparing the simulated near - field profiles of the probe with the ones of electric and magnetic dipole sources .
we show that the absorption profiles obtained by raster scanning the probe over a metallic sample , in our case a plasmonic bar , are similar to the profiles obtained when substituting the probe by a lateral magnetic dipole .
thus , the probe and the tangential magnetic point dipole source are coupling to the plasmonic sample in a similar way .
currently , this is being verified for other types of samples , namely - dielectric structures @xcite .
this result opens up new possibilities for performing much simpler and faster simulations and gain better understanding of the near - field images .
we experimentally demonstrate the equivalence between the reciprocal use of the probe as a lateral magnetic field source ( illumination mode ) and detector ( collection mode ) .
this result is practically very useful , because the near - field interactions and images are typically more intuitive to understand when the probe is perceived as a magnetic field detector .
however from technical point of view , the setup is much easier to work with and align in the reciprocal illumination mode .

 while the electric field components of light can be routinely obtained , imaging of the magnetic components has only recently become of interest . 
 this is so due to the development of artificial materials , which enhance and exploit the typically weak magnetic light - matter interactions to offer extraordinary optical properties . 
 consequently , both sources and detectors of the magnetic field of light are now required .    in this paper , assisted by finite - difference time - domain simulations 
 , we suggest that the circular aperture at the apex of a metal coated hollow - pyramid snom probe can be approximated by a lateral magnetic dipole source . 
 this validates its use as a detector for the lateral magnetic near - field , as illustrated here for a plasmonic nanobar sample .

let @xmath21 be a group .
a map @xmath22 is called a _ quasi - morphism _ if @xmath23 is finite . the value @xmath24 is called the _ defect _ of the quasi - morphism .
a quasi - morphism @xmath25 is _ homogeneous _ if @xmath26 for all @xmath27 and @xmath28 .
every quasi - morphism can be modified to a homogeneous quasi - morphism by taking the limit : @xmath29 a typical example of homogeneous quasi - morphism is the _ translation number _ @xmath30 given by : @xmath31 here @xmath32 is the group of orientation - preserving homeomorphisms of @xmath33 that are lifts of orientation - preserving homeomorphisms of @xmath34 . the limit @xmath35 does not depend on the choice of @xmath36 .

"the study of peripheral interactions of light odd - even nuclei @xmath7li and @xmath0b in nuclear track emulsion can provide a ground for including tritons as clusters into the general pattern of multiple fragmentation of heavier nuclei @xcite .
it is established that in the white  stars produced by relativistic @xmath7li nuclei in most peripheral collisions , the @xmath7li@xmath8 channel constitutes as high as 50% @xcite . in this way a dominant role a triton as a cluster with lowest separation energy ( 2.47 mev ) has been revealed for the case of relativistic @xmath7li nuclei . the present @xmath0b experiment is a logical continuation of the @xmath7li study aiming to establish the probabilities of the low threshold channels , namely , @xmath9 ( 8.67 mev ) , @xmath10 ( 11.22 mev ) , and @xmath11 ( 11.23 mev ) . in particular , it will allow one to verify whether exists a correlation between a channel threshold value , fragment number and composition , and the corresponding propability .
the @xmath0b nucleus is a daughter one in the @xmath12 decay of its mirror nucleus @xmath0c having a very similar level structure . as application
, the present study will provide a comparison ground to explore in future the @xmath13he role as a cluster in low threshold breakups of a @xmath0c nucleus : @xmath14 ( 7.54 mev ) , @xmath15 ( 9.22 mev ) , and @xmath11 ( 8.69 mev ) and to evalute a coulomb effects in a few - body fragmentation .
a stack of br-2 photoemulsion layers , the dimensions and the thickness of which being 10@xmath1620 @xmath17 and 600 @xmath18 m , repectively , was exposured to a beam of @xmath0b nuclei accelerated to a momentum 2.75a gev / c at the jinr nuclotron .
an example of the central interaction of relativistic @xmath0b in emulsion is given in fig .
[ fig:111 ] .
the @xmath0b beam was directed parallel to the long side of the emulsion plane .
interactions were sought by viewing along the primary nucleus track . over the total viewed -track length of 7141.5 cm we found 542 interactions of @xmath0b with emulsion nuclei used in this analysis .
in such a way , the mean free path was found to be @xmath19=(13.2@xmath200.6 ) cm .
this value agrees well with the calculations by the geometric model .
the relativistic fragment charge was determined by the method of counting the number of @xmath21 electrons on the fragment track .
the results of the determination of the charges z@xmath3=3 - 5 by this method are given in fig .
[ fig:1 ] , which illustrates its high reliability .
the angular distributions of the @xmath0b fragments are presented in fig .
[ fig:2 ] separately for singly , doubly , and multiply , z@xmath222 charged fragments .
the emission angles for z@xmath222 are restricted in interval @xmath233@xmath24 , and the ones for doubly charged fragments to an interval @xmath255@xmath24 .
the angles for singly charged particles were measured in an interval @xmath2515@xmath24 .
[ fig:2 ] ( above ) shows that the angular distribution changes its shape at about @xmath26=6@xmath24 .
this shape of the angular distribution may be due to the fact that the singly charged particles are a mixture of the particles of the two kinds : relativistic hydrogen isotopes and produced mesons the angular distributions of which are displaced relatively to one another . as momentum measurements show
the distribution for singly charged fragments occupy a region @xmath236 - 8@xmath24 . basing on the momentum measurements ,
the angular distribution shape and the estimation of the projectile fragmentation angle by the equation    @xmath27    a limiting angle for singly charged fragments was chosen to be @xmath26=6@xmath24 .
in order to study @xmath0b cluster degrees of freedom use was made of the events in which the total charge of particles emitted within the fragmenting cone is equal to the charge of the projectile nucleus q=@xmath28z@xmath3 .
such events were divided into two classes a and b. class a implies the breakup of a projectile not accompanied by the production of new particles , n@xmath29=0 . in their turn , the a class events can be subdivided into two groups : interactions without breakup of a target , n@xmath30=0 ( n@xmath30=n@xmath31+n@xmath32 ) or whitestars , and interactions accompanied by the breakup of a target , n@xmath338 , n@xmath32=0 in which the presence of several low - energy fragments is allowed .
these group which posess close characteristics are united into common class in order to increase statistics .
events of the class a are notable for a low energy transfered to the projectile which results mostly in violations of intrinsic intercluster bonds
. therefore they are most interesting for the study of nuclear clustering .
class b implies peripheral but violent interactions of nuclei . in the events of this class , there can exist newly produced particles with emission angles @xmath3415@xmath24 , as well as any quantity of the target fragments , n@xmath350 .
the fragmentation channels for both classes are given in table [ tab:1 ] .

this channel for whitestars produced in fragmentation of @xmath43b nuclei amounts to 65% .
only 14% of the events of the projectile breakup have fragments with charge z@xmath222 while in peripheral interactions such events amount to 30% .
3 .   in the projectile breakup events ( a )
there was observed no li fragments , while in peripheral interactions ( b ) such events constitute 13% .
the consimilar topology of white  stars was investigated for @xmath43b nuclei at the energy of 1.0 gev per nucleon @xcite .
the fraction of the @xmath43b@xmath44d+@xmath45 decays is 40% of the events with a charge topology 2 + 2 + 1 .
the contribution of the @xmath43b@xmath44d+@xmath46be+d@xmath47+d channel is estimated to be 18@xmath203% .
the probability of observing a 4 + 1 topology in the @xmath43b@xmath44p+@xmath48be decay is found small ( 3% ) .
even being limited with current statistics one may conclude that the 3-body decays with a charge configuration 2 + 2 + 1 fig .
[ fig : aba11])play a leading role in peripheral breakups of @xmath0b as well as @xmath43b nuclei in spite of higher threshold values with the respect to the li+he mode ones
. it may be noticed , that the both breakup patterns is indicative of an analogy with the 3-body dissociation @xmath49c@xmath443@xmath50 with one of @xmath50 particles substituted by a deuteron or triton @xcite .
in order to study the basic @xmath0b fragmentation chahhel , @xmath28z@xmath3=2 + 2 + 1 the singly charged fragment momenta were measured by the coulomb multiple scattering method .
the measurements enabled us to divide the singly charged fragments into protons , deuterons and tritons using the fact that the spectator fragments conserve the momentum per nucleon equal the primary one : @xmath51 .
the results of measurements are given in fig .
[ fig:3 ] . as is seen , this method makes it possible to separate reliably the singly charged fragments by their mass .
thus we had determined for this channel the ratio between protons , deuterons and tritons : n@xmath4:n@xmath5:n@xmath6=4:4:4 for @xmath0b breakup events and n@xmath4:n@xmath5:n@xmath6=17:5:1 for the @xmath0b peripheral interactions ( table [ tab:2 ] ) .

a large part of fragment tritons in @xmath0b breakups ( about 1/3 ) testifies in favor of their existance as clusters weak internal bonds in @xmath0b which are easily get destroyed in violent interaction processes . besides , in 7 peripheral interactions ( 23% ) the momentum of singly charged particles was less than 1 gev / c , that is , they may be either newly produced particles , or scattered protons .
thus , it is confirmed that the breakups of nuclei are more effective for the study of their cluster structure as compared with the violent interactions of nuclei .
the events of the classes a and b in which the charge of the primary track was 5 and total charge in the fragmentation cone was @xmath28z@xmath3=6 were ascribed to the inelastic charge exchange events above a particle decay threshold of an excited @xmath0c@xmath53 nucleus .
the statistics of the events of an inelastic charge exchange of @xmath0b to @xmath0c@xmath53 is given in table [ tab:3 ] .
the particular feature of the present experiment was the observation of 8 events which can be considered as an inelastic charge exchange of @xmath0b to @xmath0c@xmath53 followed by a breakup into two fragments with charges z@xmath3=4 and z@xmath3=2 fig .

were measured several times .
of these , 6 events belong to class a , in 5 events there is none of the particles but the above mentioned fragments , and two events belong to the class b. the fraction of such events is about 1.5% of all events found in the initial scanning of the interactions , that is , the mean free path for the charge exchange of @xmath0b to @xmath0c@xmath53 @xmath19 is equal to ( 0.89@xmath200.32 ) m.    c|c|c|c|c|c|c    n@xmath36  &  n@xmath37  &  n@xmath38  &  n@xmath39  &  n@xmath40  &  n@xmath41  &  n@xmath42   +  1  &  -  &  -  &  -  &  1  &  0  &  1 +  -  &  1  &  -  &  1  &  -  &  6  &  2 +  -  &  1  &  -  &  -  &  2  &  0  &  7 +  -  &  -  &  1  &  -  &  3  &  0  &  2 +  -  &  -  &  -  &  2  &  2  &  0  &  3 +    table [ tab:3 ] clearly demonstrate appearance of low - lying cluster modes when collision inelasticity has a minimal obsevability .
the decay of @xmath0c nucleus into two particles with charges 4 and 2 can occur only in the @xmath0c@xmath54be+@xmath55he . in the events of the class
a , there was found no inelastic charge exchange of @xmath0b to @xmath0c with a decay in other channels .
however , in order to establish unabiguously the fact of the charge exchange it is required to carry out he momentum measurements . nevertheless , in distinction to the considered above @xmath0b case in table [ tab:1 ] there is indication in on more important role of 2-body dissociations of excited @xmath0c than 3-body ones - a class events with final state 3he were not observed ( table [ tab:3 ] ) .
this obvious difference may be originated due to a higher coulomb barrier in a @xmath0c nucleus .
this feature has to be verified in special @xmath0c study provided with emulsions exposured in a secondary beam of these nuclei produced in the charge exchange process @xmath0b@xmath56c .
this paper provides a framework for a longer time - demanding analysis
. already found @xmath0b collisions will allow us to improve our statistics by factor 4 - 5 to strengthen the conlclusions . nevertheless , in spite of rather limited statistics analyzed to the present time one can derive the important features of peripheral fragmentation of @xmath0b nuclei .
firstly , 3-cluster dissociations h+2he provide a leading contribution to the breakup cross - section .
secondly , there is an indication on a strong triton contribution comparable with @xmath7li@xmath8 .
thirdly , a @xmath0b nucleus fragmentation is promising source to populate @xmath0c@xmath53 excited states in charge exchange processes directly or via special formation of the @xmath0c secondary beam in a charge exchange process .

 the relative probability of various fragmentation channels for nucleus breakups ( class a ) and more violent peripheral interactions ( class b ) have been determined . for classes under investigations 
 the sum of the fragment charges in narrow forward cone is equal to the projectile charge , but in the events of class a there are no secondary particles and in the events of class b there are . in both classes the main channels 
 is @xmath0b@xmath12he+x : 62% and 50% , corresponding .    
 the main channel @xmath0b@xmath12@xmath2(z@xmath3=2)+(z@xmath3=1 ) was investigated in details . 
 momentum measurements of single - charged fragments have been done to determine number of p , d and t in the channel . 
 this way it was found that the ratio n@xmath4 : n@xmath5 : n@xmath6 is about 1:1:1 for @xmath0b nuclei dissociation and about 15:5:1 for peripheral interactions of @xmath0b nuclei . "
"the study of parity nonconservation ( pnc ) in atoms provides a low - energy search for new physics beyond the standard model ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) , which is a relatively inexpensive alternative to the high - energy searches performed in colliders .
in fact , pnc in cesium is currently the most precise low - energy test of the electroweak theory due to the high accuracy of the measurements  @xcite and the calculations needed for their interpretation  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) .
the level of precision that has been obtained in atomic physics calculations and measurements has meant that strong - field qed corrections are observable and must be taken into account .
it was shown in fact , that the inclusion of self - energy - type qed corrections to pnc calculations in cesium restored the agreement with the standard model  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) . just as these calculations have proven to be important in the case of cesium
, they will be necessary for the calculations of other atoms as the accuracy increases and as new experiments become available .
for this reason , using the `` radiative potential '' method developed in ref .
@xcite , we present calculations of the qed corrections to the pnc amplitudes of several transitions in rb , cs , ba@xmath0 , tl , fr and ra@xmath0 .
the case of rubidium is interesting because of its simple electron structure and small value of different corrections to the pnc amplitude  @xcite .
the interpretation of the pnc measurements for rb can be more reliable than for other atoms .
we have shown in our previous work  @xcite that the accuracy of the calculations for rubidium can surpass those for cesium , while the pnc amplitude is only several times smaller  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) .
francium is a particularly important application .
the frpnc collaboration has begun the construction of a laser cooling and trapping apparatus at the triumf laboratories in canada with the purpose of measuring atomic parity nonconservation in artificially produced francium  @xcite . with a pnc amplitude expected to be around 15 times larger than that of cesium , and its relatively simple electronic configuration which leads to accurate calculations
, francium is an ideal atom for precision measurements of pnc  @xcite .
when these measurements become available it will be very important to have accurate atomic calculations for analysis , and these calculations will require contributions from quantum electrodynamics effects .
there are accurate calculations and measurements available for thallium  @xcite , and measurements have also been considered for the ba@xmath0 ion  @xcite and are in progress for the ra@xmath0 ion  @xcite .
the quantum electrodynamics corrections considered in this work arise from vacuum polarization and elec- tron self - energy . the inclusion of vacuum polarization is numerically relatively simple ,
achieved via inclusion of the uehling potential .
the self - energy contribution is in- cluded via the radiative potential method developed in ref .
note that the radiative correction to the electric dipole transition operator @xmath1 ( vertex correction ) is very small and may be neglected .
the change of the electric dipole matrix elements come from the qed corrections to the electron wave functions .
the parity nonconservation amplitude of a transition ( @xmath2 ) between states of the same parity can be expressed via the sum over all possible intermediate opposite parity states @xmath3 , @xmath4 ,      \label{eq : pnc}\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the electric dipole transition operator and @xmath6 is the nuclear - spin - independent weak interaction .      in the original works , qed corrections
were only calculated for the weak matrix elements ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .
this was a reasonable approximation numerically for cesium due to a chance cancellation between qed contributions coming from corrections to the energy levels and dipole matrix elements , which were calculated by flambaum and ginges  @xcite .
this cancellation is not guaranteed and it was demonstrated in ref .
@xcite that corrections from all three sources are equally important and must be included .
full determinations of qed corrections to the entire pnc amplitude have only been considered for cesium @xcite .
the radiative potential method , developed by flambaum and ginges  @xcite , defines an approximate potential @xmath7 such that the radiative correction to the energies coincides with its average value , @xmath8 this potential takes into account the local vacuum polarization operator ( including the lowest - order in @xmath9 uehling potential as well as the higher order wichmann - kroll potential ) and the non - local strong coulomb field electron self - energy operator .    in this work , we use the existing calculations of qed corrections to the weak matrix elements , which are presented in table  [ tab : weak ] .
these values have been taken from the works ref s
@xcite ( see also  @xcite ) .
midpoints and uncertainties have been chosen to agree with different previous determinations .
note also that these calculations are valid only for @xmath10-@xmath11 weak transitions .
we then use the radiative potential method outlined above , with the exception of the small wichmann - kroll term , to calculate the qed corrections to the energy levels and electric dipole matrix elements .
we then calculate the dominating terms in equation ( [ eq : pnc ] ) with and without the radiative corrections to determine the total percentage correction to the pnc amplitudes for several transitions in rb , cs , ba@xmath0 , tl , fr and ra@xmath0 .
.values ( from ref s @xcite ) for the percentage contributions of vacuum polarization including the uehling and smaller wichmann - kroll ( w - k ) potentials , and self - energy - vertex ( se - v ) to weak @xmath10-@xmath12 matrix elements for various atoms .
uncertainty is estimated from the spread of values of different sources . [ cols='<,>,>,>,>',options='header ' , ]      despite the fact that there are some individual corrections in the atoms that are quite large , there is significant cancellation between contributions from the weak matrix elements and the combined contributions from the energies and dipoles in most of the transitions presented .
this causes the total qed contributions in most atoms to be highly suppressed .
the uncertainty of the total qed corrections to the pnc amplitudes come from uncertainties of all three sources ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) added in quadrature .
the uncertainty of the first term ( @xmath13 ) has been estimated in  @xcite .
the estimation of uncertainties for two other terms ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) comes from the spread of values of the qed correction found in different approximations ( rpa , brueckner , etc . ) .

 the qed shift in energies and dipole amplitudes leads to noticeable change in the pnc amplitudes . 
 this study compliments the previously considered qed corrections to the weak matrix elements .

"among the main tasks of the current experiments at the fermilab tevatron and the future experiments at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) is the search for the higgs boson , which is the only missing particle in the standard model ( sm ) .
the electroweak precision data mainly collected at cern lep and slac slc in combination with the direct top - quark mass measurement at the tevatron favour a light higgs boson with mass @xmath2  gev with an upper bound of about 237  gev at the 95% confidence level  @xcite .
the allowed mass range is compatible with the so - called intermediate mass range , defined by @xmath3 . in this mass range ,
the decay into two photons represents one of the most useful detection modes at hadron colliders .
since there is no direct coupling of the higgs boson to photons , the process @xmath4 is loop - induced . in the limit of vanishing bottom - quark mass ,
one distinguishes at lowest order the contributions from virtual top quarks and @xmath1 bosons , where , in covariant gauge , the latter are accompanied by charged goldstone bosons ( @xmath5 ) and faddeev - popov ghosts ( @xmath6 ) .
some sample feynman diagrams are depicted in fig .
[ 1loop ] .
the corresponding contributions have been evaluated for the first time in ref .
@xcite ( for reviews , see also ref .
qcd corrections , which only affect the top - quark diagrams are known at the two-  @xcite and three - loop  @xcite orders .
recently , also the two - loop electroweak correction induced by light - fermion loops has been evaluated  @xcite . in this paper , we compute the two - loop electroweak correction that is enhanced by @xmath7 .
for this purpose , we consider the ( formal ) hierarchy @xmath8 and apply the method of asymptotic expansion  @xcite , which allows us to also evaluate four expansion terms in the ratio @xmath9 aside from the leading term in @xmath10 .
due to electromagnetic gauge invariance , the amputated transition - matrix element of @xmath11 possesses the structure @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the lorentz indices of the external photons with four - momenta @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively .
thus , the decay rate of the higgs boson into two photons is given by @xmath17 the form factor @xmath18 is evaluated in perturbation theory as @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 denote the one - loop contributions induced by virtual top quarks and @xmath1 bosons , respectively , @xmath22 stands for the two - loop electroweak correction involving virtual top quarks , and the ellipsis represents the residual one- and two - loop contributions as well as all contributions involving more than two loops .
in the practical calculation , it is convenient to project out the scalar amplitudes that multiply the basic lorentz tensors @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 . the corresponding projectors can be obtained by in turn contracting @xmath26 with these lorentz tensors and solving the resulting system of linear equations .
we separately project out the coefficients of the tensors @xmath27 and @xmath28 , and thus have a strong check on our calculation .
furthermore , we adopt a general @xmath29 gauge in our calculation and verify that the gauge parameter drops out in the final result . for simplicity , the element @xmath30 of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa quark mixing matrix is set to unity , so that the quarks of the third fermion generation decouple from those of the first two , which they actually do to very good approximation @xcite .

. section  [ sec::numerics ] contains the discussion of the numerical results .
we conclude with a summary in section  [ sec::summary ] .
the application of the asymptotic - expansion technique to the one - loop diagrams , some of which are shown in fig .
[ 1loop ] , leads to a naive taylor expansion in the external momenta @xmath35 and @xmath36 .
nevertheless , we use already here a completely automated set - up , which consists in the successive use of the computer programs ` qgraf `  @xcite , ` q2e `  @xcite , ` exp `  @xcite , and ` matad `  @xcite . first , ` qgraf ` is used to generate the feynman diagrams .
its output is then rewritten by ` q2e ` to be understandable by ` exp ` . in the two - loop case ,
the latter performs the asymptotic expansion and generates the relevant subdiagrams according to the rules of the so - called hard - mass procedure  @xcite . `
form `  @xcite files are generated , which can be read by ` matad `  @xcite , which performs the very calculation of the diagrams .    the analytic expression for the born result can be found in refs .
@xcite . for completeness , we list it here in closed form and as an expansion for @xmath37 , which we reproduce .

the higgs - boson mass entering the expansion parameters @xmath46 and @xmath41 partly arises from the couplings involving one higgs and two goldstone bosons , but also from the expansion in the external momenta due to the kinematic relation @xmath47 .
we wish to note that the result for the process @xmath48 is simply obtained by setting @xmath49 and performing the substitution @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the strong - coupling constant .    in the remainder of this section ,
let us discuss the counterterm contributions needed for our two - loop analysis .
we adopt the on - mass - shell scheme and regularize the ultraviolet divergences by means of dimensional regularization , with @xmath52 space - time dimensions and t  hooft mass scale @xmath13 .
we use the anti - commuting definition of @xmath53 .
as will become clearer in the next section , it is important to treat the tadpole contributions properly in our calculation .
for this reason , in the following , we list the corresponding contributions separately and mark them by the superscript `` tad '' . inspection of the one - loop diagrams reveals that , to @xmath54 , we have to renormalize the higgs - boson wave function and mass , the @xmath1-boson mass , and the top - quark mass .
the corresponding counterterms are defined through @xmath55 note that @xmath56 is obtained from the derivative of the higgs - boson self - energy and thus has no tadpole contribution .
the mass counterterms are obtained from the corresponding two - point functions , where only the @xmath57-enhanced contributions have to be considered . up to and including quadratic terms in @xmath57 , we have @xmath58 , \nonumber\\    \frac{\delta m_{h}^{2,tad}}{m_{h}^{2 } } & = & 12 n_{c } x_t    \frac{m_t^2}{m_{h}^{2 } }    \left ( \delta - \ln\frac{m_{t}^{2}}{\mu^{2 } } + 1\right ) , \nonumber\\    \frac{\delta m_{w}^{2}}{m_{w}^{2 } } & = & -2 n_c x_t    \left ( \delta - \ln\frac{m_{t}^{2}}{\mu^{2 } } + \frac{1}{2 } \right ) , \nonumber\\    \frac{\delta m_{w}^{2,tad}}{m_{w}^{2 } } & = & 8 n_c x_t    \frac{m_{t}^{2}}{m_{h}^{2 } }    \left ( \delta - \ln\frac{m_{t}^{2}}{\mu^{2 } }   + 1 \right ) , \nonumber\\    \frac{\delta m_{t}}{m_{t } } & = & \frac{3}{2 } x_t     \left ( \delta - \ln\frac{m_{t}^{2}}{\mu^{2 } }     + \frac{8}{3 } \right ) ,    \nonumber\\    \frac{\delta m_{t}^{tad}}{m_{t } } & = & 4 n_c x_t \frac{m_{t}^{2}}{m_{h}^{2 } }    \left ( \delta - \ln\frac{m_{t}^{2}}{\mu^{2}}+ 1 \right ) , \label{eq : ct}\end{aligned}\ ] ] with @xmath59 and @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is euler s constant .
the @xmath1-boson mass renormalization is needed for the @xmath1 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 propagators , where @xmath62 enters as a parameter .
furthermore , also the @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 vertices contain @xmath62 .
the only vertex involving @xmath67 is @xmath68 , which induces two - loop contributions via @xmath69 .
finally , @xmath57 occurs in the top - quark propagator and in the @xmath70 vertex .
the wave function renormalization and the renormalization of a factor @xmath71 is common to all one - loop diagrams .
this allows for the definition of a universal factor @xcite , which is finite in our calculation .
it is given by @xmath72
the contributions of @xmath54 are obtained by considering all two - loop electroweak diagrams involving a virtual top quark .
this includes also the tadpole diagrams with a closed top - quark loop , which are proportional to @xmath73 . for arbitrary gauge parameter ,
this leads us to consider a total of @xmath74 diagrams .
some of them are depicted in fig .
[ 2loop ] .
these diagrams naturally split into two classes .
the first class consists of those diagrams where a neutral boson , i.e.  a higgs boson or a neutral goldstone boson ( @xmath75 ) , is added to the one - loop top - quark diagrams .
the exchange of a @xmath76 boson does not produce quadratic contributions in @xmath57 .
the application of the asymptotic - expansion technique to these diagrams leads to a simple taylor expansion in the external momenta .
this is different for the second class of diagrams , which , next to the top quark , also contain a @xmath1 or @xmath5 boson and , as a consequence , also the bottom quark , which we take to be massless throughout the calculation . due to the presence of cuts through light - particle lines , the asymptotic - expansion technique applied to these diagrams
also yields nontrivial terms , as is exemplified in fig .
[ mt4asex ] . the first contribution on the right - hand side of the equation in fig .
[ mt4asex ] symbolizes the naive taylor expansion in the external momenta . in the second contribution
, the subdiagram to the right of the star has to be expanded in its external momenta , which also includes the loop momentum of the co - subgraph to the left of the star .
the result of the expansion is inserted as an effective vertex , and the remaining integration over the second loop - momentum is performed after a further expansion in @xmath35 and @xmath36 .
the latter is allowed , since we work in the limit @xmath77 .
we wish to mention that such contributions develop @xmath73 terms , which cancel in the final result only in combination with the @xmath73 terms from the counterterms of eq .
( [ eq : ct ] ) and the genuine two - loop tadpole diagrams . for this reason
, it is crucial to include the latter in our calculation . as a further comment
, we note that , unlike the example of fig .
[ mt4asex ] , it can also happen that the co - subgraph only involves massless bottom quarks , and no expansion in the external momenta is allowed . in our calculation , the contributions from such co - subgraphs vanish .

we do this in the limit of large and small values of @xmath79 . to this end
, we apply the asymptotic - expansion technique in the following four limiting cases @xmath80 where the inequality @xmath81 has to be understood in a formal sense , as , in practice , one has @xmath37 .
the result we obtain by asymptotic expansion is an expansion of the exact result for the @xmath0 contribution in powers of @xmath41 . in case @xmath82 , where @xmath83 , which corresponds to t  hooft - feynman gauge , we are able to evaluate the first five terms of this expansion . in cases
@xmath84@xmath85 , we compute the first two expansion terms and find agreement with the result obtained for @xmath83 .    our final result for @xmath22 emerges as the sum @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the universal contribution induced by the one - loop term @xmath88 of eq .
( [ renuniv ] ) , @xmath89 is the two - loop contribution involving virtual @xmath31 and @xmath75 bosons , and @xmath90 the remaining two - loop contribution involving virtual @xmath1 and @xmath5 bosons . in @xmath89 and @xmath90 ,
also the corresponding counterterm and tadpole contributions are included .
for the individual pieces , we find @xmath91 where @xmath92 is defined below eq .
( [ eq::born ] ) and the ellipses indicate terms of @xmath93 . notice that the leading @xmath54 term of @xmath89 is not accompanied by an expansion in @xmath94 , since the contributing diagrams do not involve virtual @xmath1 or @xmath5 bosons . on the other hand
, detailed inspection reveals that there is also no expansion in the parameter @xmath95 , contrary to what might be expected at first sight .
inserting eq .
( [ eq : terms ] ) into eq .
( [ eq : sum ] ) , we obtain our final result @xmath96    the correction of @xmath54 to @xmath97 was also considered in ref .
the expression found in that reference disagrees with our result .
one reason is probably that the authors of ref .
@xcite only considered virtual @xmath5 bosons , but disregarded virtual @xmath1-bosons .
however , our calculation shows that both types of charged bosons have to be taken into account at the same time in order to arrive at an ultraviolet - finite and gauge - parameter - independent result . in ref .
@xcite , the dominant two - loop electroweak corrections to the higgs - boson couplings to pairs of gauge bosons and light fermions induced by a sequential isodoublet of ultraheavy quarks @xmath98 were investigated by means of a low - energy theorem @xcite . in that paper , also a result for the @xmath54 correction to @xmath97 is presented , which is obtained by sending the mass of the fourth - generation down quark ( @xmath99 ) to zero at the end of the calculation , which is performed assuming that @xmath100 .
this result also deviates from the one obtained above .
detailed inspection reveals that this difference may be attributed to the interchange of limits performed in ref .
@xcite , which is not justified in the case under consideration , although such a procedure is known to lead to correct results in simpler examples . in fact , reanalyzing the limiting case @xmath101 using the asymptotic - expansion technique , we are able to reproduce the terms of eqs .
( 48)(54 ) in ref .  @xcite that survive in this limit and , at the same time , to identify contributions that do not occur if @xmath102 is imposed at the outset of the calculation .    for completeness
, we also specify our corresponding result for @xmath103 .
its evaluation is significantly simpler , since , at one loop , only the top - quark diagrams contribute .
consequently , to obtain the leading two - loop correction proportional to @xmath7 , we only have to consider the exchange of @xmath31 , @xmath75 , and @xmath5 bosons .
this only requires a naive taylor expansion in @xmath35 and @xmath36 .
we obtain @xmath104 with @xmath105 .
this result is in agreement with ref .
@xcite , where a low - energy theorem @xcite was used .
we are now in a position to present our numerical results and to assess the convergence properties of our expansions in @xmath106 and @xmath94 .
we use the following numerical values for our input parameters  @xcite : @xmath107  gev@xmath108 , @xmath109  gev , and @xmath110  gev .
we first consider the one - loop amplitudes @xmath20 and @xmath21 induced by virtual top quarks and @xmath1 bosons , respectively , for which exact results are available .
they are shown in figs .
[ 1loopt ] and  [ 1loopw ] as functions of @xmath46 and @xmath41 , respectively .
the solid curves indicate the exact results , while the dashed curves represent the sequences of approximations that are obtained by successively including higher powers of @xmath46 and @xmath41 , respectively , in the expansions .
the vertical lines encompass the intermediate - mass range of the higgs boson , @xmath3 . in fig .
[ 1loopw ] , the second vertical line coincides with the right edge of the frame . from fig .
[ 1loopt ] , we observe that the approximation consisting of the first three terms of the expansion in @xmath46 is practically indistinguishable from the exact result up to @xmath111 .
the same is true for the sum of the first five expansion terms up to @xmath112 , which corresponds to @xmath113  gev . in the case of @xmath21 ,
the convergence is slightly worse , since @xmath114 corresponds to @xmath115 and the exact result behaves like @xmath116 in this limit .
nevertheless , for @xmath117  gev , 140  gev , and @xmath118 , the approximation by five expansion terms deviates from the exact result by as little as 0.3% , 1.6% , and 19.9% , respectively .
having demonstrated the fast convergence of the expansions in @xmath46 and @xmath41 of the one - loop amplitudes @xmath119 and @xmath120 , respectively , we now proceed to the two - loop electroweak amplitude @xmath121 , for which we found the leading @xmath54 term together with its subleading mass corrections through @xmath122 .
this corresponds to a first approximation and four improvements , which are visualized by the five dashed curves in fig .
[ 2loopt ] . as in fig .
[ 1loopw ] , the dotted vertical line and the right edge of the frame enclose the intermediate - mass range of the higgs boson .
we again observe rapid convergence .
the goodness of our best approximation may be assessed by considering its relative deviation from the second best one . for @xmath117  gev , 140  gev , and @xmath118 ,
this amounts to 0.3% , 1.0% , and 2.8% , respectively .
the situation is very similar to the one in fig .
[ 1loopw ] .
in fact , the corresponding figures for @xmath120 are 0.4% , 1.1% , and 3.1% .
we thus expect that the goodness of the approximation of @xmath121 by the expansion through @xmath122 is comparable to the case of @xmath120 .    for the comparison with future measurements of @xmath97 , all known corrections have to be included in eq .
( [ notation ] ) . in this connection
, it is interesting to compare the size of the new @xmath54 electroweak correction with the well - known @xmath123 qcd one @xcite .
this is done in fig .
( [ fig::lo_nlo ] ) , where the respective corrections to @xmath97 are displayed as functions of @xmath67 . as in figs .
[ 1loopw ] and [ 2loopt ] , the dotted vertical line and the right edge of the frame margin the intermediate - mass range of the higgs boson .
we observe that , within the latter , the @xmath54 correction slightly exceeds the @xmath123 one in magnitude , a rather surprising finding . due to the sign difference ,
the two corrections practically compensate each other .
the two - loop electroweak correction induced by light - fermion loops , which has become available recently @xcite , is also negative , but has a slightly smaller size than the @xmath54 correction .
we calculated the dominant two - loop electroweak correction , of @xmath0 , to the partial width of the decay into two photons of the sm higgs boson in the intermediate mass range , @xmath3 , where this process is of great phenomenological relevance for the searches at hadron colliders of this elusive missing link of the sm .
we evaluated the relevant feynman diagrams by application of the asymptotic - expansion technique exploiting the mass hierarchy @xmath124 . in this way
, we obtained an expansion of the full @xmath0 result in the mass ratio @xmath125 through @xmath126 .
the convergence property of this expansion and our experience with the analogue expansion at the born level , where the exact result is available for reference , lead us to believe that these five terms should provide a very good approximation to the exact result for @xmath127  gev . by the same token , the deviation of this approximation for the @xmath0 amplitude @xmath121 from the unknown exact result for this quantity is likely to range from 2% to 20% as the value of @xmath67 runs from 140  gev to @xmath128 .    in the intermediate higgs - boson mass range ,
the @xmath0 electroweak correction reduces the size of @xmath97 by approximately 2.5% and thus fully cancels the positive shift due to the well - known @xmath123 qcd correction @xcite .    as a by - product of our analysis
, we also recovered the @xmath0 correction to the partial width of the decay into two gluon jets of the intermediate - mass higgs boson , in agreement with the literature @xcite .

"the fundamental problem of the behaviour of the electromagnetic field in material media has attracted a lot of attention of physicists for decades and continues to be a living and interesting research area of classical and quantum electrodynamics .
the solution of this problem has supported the development of our understanding of the interaction of radiation and matter .
the behaviour of the electromagnetic field is well understood in empty cavities or in free space but in the presence of the material media there is still work to be done .    in the past few years , the problem of electromagnetic waves propagating through dispersive and nondispersive material media has drawn a special attention of physicists motivated by the growth of experiments taking place inside material media @xcite . on the other hand , the study of electrodynamics in conducting and nonconducting time - dependent linear media ( where the electric permittivity , magnetic permeability and/or conductivity vary in time ) has also been an important subject of great physical interest @xcite . here
, it is worth mentioning that a time - dependent dielectric permittivity system can produce quanta of the electromagnetic field ( photons ) even from vacuum states @xcite .
this phenomenon is similar to pure quantum effects such as dynamical casimir effect ( attractive interaction between two perfectly conducting plates separated by a short distance in vacuum ) @xcite .
also , a model for plane wave in a medium with refraction index decreasing in time to study the unruh effect ( observers in an accelerating reference frame see a thermal radiation field at a temperature proportional to their acceleration ) has been considered @xcite .
hence , the study of electrodynamics in nonstationary media is highly important both because of the practical applications and the academic interest .    in this work
, we investigate the classical electromagnetic field in a homogeneous linear media , in the absence of charges , with time - dependent electric permittivity , magnetic permeability and conductivity .
remarkably , we find that the time dependence of the electric permittivity gives rise to an additional term in the right - hand side of the ampere - maxwell equation .
consequently we have obtained a generalization of the ampere - maxwell equation for nonstationary linear media .
furthermore , in this case , contrary to the time - independent one , the electric and magnetic fields do not satisfy the same wave equation , _
i.e. _ , the time - variation of the properties of the material media generates an asymmetry in the fields propagation . as particular illustrative cases , we consider linearly and exponentially growing electric permittivities , as well as a sinusoidally periodic one .
we organize this paper as follows . in section
ii , we investigate the electrodynamics in a homogeneous time - dependent linear media . in section iii we discuss the particular cases of time dependence of the electric permittivity mentioned above .
we conclude the paper in section iv with a brief summary .
we start our discussion with the well - known maxwell s equations in media without charge sources , which are given by @xmath0 for time - dependent homogeneous linear media , the constitutive equations relating the fields and currents are given by @xmath1 where , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the time - dependent electric permittivity , magnetic permeability and conductivity , respectively . then , using eqs .
( [ constitutive ] ) and ( [ maxwell4 ] ) we get @xmath4 this represents a generalization of the ampere - maxwell equation for nonstationary media with time - dependent electrical permittivity .
note that in the right - hand - side of this equation , the unusual rightmost term arises as a consequence of the time dependence of the electric permittivity .
what is more , the time dependence of the magnetic permeability and of the conductivity do not generate any new term in the ampere - maxwell equation .
as far as we know , the generalization of the ampere - maxwell equation for time - dependent media has not been considered in the literature yet .    in order to write the wave equations for the electric and magnetic fields , we proceed as usual by taking the rotational of the maxwell rotational equations [ eqs .
( [ maxwell3 ] ) and ( [ maxwell4 ] ) ] @xmath5.\end{aligned}\ ] ] using the well known relation @xmath6 for a vector field @xmath7 , and remembering that in the absence of free charges @xmath8 , we have @xmath9 now , taking into account the eqs .
( [ maxwell3 ] ) and ( [ maxwell4 ] ) we obtain that @xmath10 where dots represent time derivatives . at this point
it is already clear the asymmetry introduced by the time dependence of the electric permittivity , the magnetic permeability and the conductivity in the wave equations for electric and magnetic fields , that is , contrary to time - independent permittivity case , they do not satisfy the same wave equation .
this notable property , to the best of our knowledge , has not been discussed in the literature yet .
furthermore , since the magnetic permeability usually almost does not differ from the vacuum value @xmath11 , except for ferromagnets , we make the approximations @xmath12 and @xmath13 .
this approximation is valid even for ferromagnets provided that the magnetic permittivity is constant . as a result , we have @xmath14 it is worth noticing that the equivalent equation for the magnetic field is not modified under these approximations . what is more , from eqs .
( [ wavee ] ) and ( [ waveb ] ) we see that these equations differ by a factor 2 which multiply the first time - derivative of the permittivity and the additional terms proportional to the electric field , which appear only in the electric field wave equation .
thus , the asymmetry between electric and magnetic fields remains even if the magnetic permeability is time - independent .
further , since the vector potential and the magnetic field relation is time - independent , the wave equation for the vector potential in the coulomb gauge is exactly the same as the one for the magnetic field  @xcite .
now , let us look for solutions to the wave equations for @xmath15 and @xmath16 . employing the method of separation of variables
, we write the electric field as @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are mode and amplitude functions ( we consider the electromagnetic field in a certain volume of space ) . substituting ( [ repr ] ) into ( [ wavee ] )
we find that @xmath20 = 0.\ ] ] thus , for any component @xmath21 of any vector @xmath22 we have @xmath23 the left and right hand sides of eq .
( [ separation ] ) must be equal to the same constant , since they are function of the position and time , respectively .
therefore , we have , @xmath24 where @xmath25 here @xmath26^{-1/2}$ ] is the speed of light in the medium , @xmath27 is the eigenvalue of the laplacian of @xmath28 and @xmath29^{-1/2}$ ] is a speed of light in the vacuum .
now , let us proceed with similar methodology for the magnetic field and write @xmath30 where @xmath31 are the amplitude functions ( once again , we consider the electromagnetic field in a certain volume of space ) . proceeding along the same lines as above
, we find the following equation for the amplitude function @xmath32 from the equations ( [ u2 ] ) and ( [ u3 ] ) we see that for @xmath33 the amplitudes of the electric and magnetic fields are damped .
thus , the time dependence of the electric permittivity also causes an additional damping in the amplitudes of the electric and magnetic fields .
this interesting effect has already been considered in ref .
@xcite .    in the following ,
we move our attention to the solutions of ( 18 ) . considering the electromagnetic field to be contained in a certain cubic volume @xmath34 of nonrefracting media ,
the mode functions are required to satisfy the transversality condition @xmath35 and to form a orthonormal set @xcite .
furthermore , assuming periodic boundary conditions on the surface , the mode function may be written in terms of plane waves as @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the size of the cube , @xmath38 is the wave vector and @xmath39 are unit vectors in the directions of polarization ( @xmath40 ) , which must be perpendicular to the wave vector because of the transversality condition . with the spacial mode functions @xmath41 completely determined , we only need the canonical variable @xmath19 in order to obtain the electric field @xmath15 .
then , the field @xmath15 confined in the cubic volume of side @xmath42 can be written as @xmath43    analogously , the magnetic field @xmath16 takes the form @xmath44 thus , with the knowledge of @xmath19 and @xmath45 , which are obtained from eqs .
( [ u2 ] ) and ( [ u3 ] ) , respectively , we have a complete description of the electromagnetic field .
in this section , we discuss the time - evolution of the electric and magnetic fields for different time dependences of the electric permittivity . for simplicity , we restrict our analysis to the case of dielectric materials ( @xmath46 ) and non - ferromagnetic materials ( @xmath47 ) .
the first case we consider is the one of an electric permittivity which grows linearly with time , i.e. @xmath48 where @xmath49 is a constant with units of the inverse of time . in this case , the amplitude functions for the electric and magnetic fields , eqs .
( [ u2 ] ) and ( [ u3 ] ) , respectively , become @xmath50 in both cases , the solution is given in terms of the @xmath51 and @xmath52 bessel functions as @xcite @xmath53 where @xmath54 are constants to be determined by the initial conditions . as expected , both field vanish with @xmath55 due to the electric permittivity increase .
however , they decay with distinct rates .
while the electric field decays , in the long time regime , as @xmath56 , the magnetic field decay is slower ( @xmath57 ) .
it is worth noticing that , for a linear growth of the electric permittivity , the only difference between the electric and magnetic amplitude function equation is the factor @xmath58 in the first derivative of the amplitude function . in fig .
[ fig : linear ] , we show a typical time evolution of the electric and magnetic field , where the faster decay of the electric field is clear . this figure also illustrate the oscillatory behavior of both fields .
now , let us consider a exponentially growing electric permittivity @xmath59 where @xmath60 is a constant with units of the inverse of time . in this case
, the amplitude functions for the electric and magnetic fields are respectively @xmath61 in this case , there is an additional term proportional to the amplitude function which comes from the second derivative of the electric permittivity .
once again , the solutions may be written in terms of @xmath62 and @xmath63 bessel functions  @xcite @xmath64,\\   \tilde{q}_l(t ) & = & \frac{\omega_l   e^{-\frac{\gamma   t}{2 } } } { \gamma } \left[d_3 j_1\left(\frac{2     e^{-\frac{t \gamma } { 2 } } \omega_l } { \gamma } \right)+2   d_4     y_1\left(\frac{2 e^{-\frac{t \gamma } { 2 } } \omega_l } { \gamma     } \right)\right],\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath65 are constants to be determined by the initial conditions .
the asymptotic behavior for large @xmath55 is even more surprisingly .
while the @xmath66 and @xmath67 terms all decay to zero exponentially , as @xmath68 , the @xmath69 term which appears in the solution of the amplitude functions of the magnetic field goes to @xmath70 hence , depending on the initial conditions , the long time behavior may be a non - zero constant magnetic field , as can be seen in fig .

[ fig : linear ] and  [ fig : exp ] , we can see that the decay of the electromagnetic field is faster in the later case .
next , let us assume a sinusoidal time - varying permittivity given by @xmath71,$ ] where @xmath60 is a constant with units of the inverse of time and @xmath72 in an dimensionless constant . in this case
, we were unable to find a analytical solution .
hence , we solved the differential equations for the amplitude function numerically .
as shown in fig .
[ fig : sin ] , the amplitude functions for the electric and magnetic fields oscillate in phase , but they still differ ( while for time - independent electric permittivity , they are the same ) .
in this work , we have presented a simple and clean - cut treatment for the problem of classical electrodynamics in nonstationary media without charge sources .
we have seen that the time dependence of the electric permittivity gives rise to an additional term in the right - hand - side of the ampere - maxwell equation . besides , the time dependence of the electric permittivity , the magnetic permeability and the conductivity cause an asymmetry between the electric and magnetic field wave equations .
these surprisingly and intriguing results have not been explored in the literature yet .
we also have considered as particular cases a linearly and an exponentially increasing permittivity , as well as a sinusoidal periodic electric permittivity .
we showed that in the first two case the electromagnetic field was attenuated , while the sinusoidal time dependence induced a periodic behavior of the fields .
furthermore , the quantum counterpart of this problem ( for real electric permittivity and magnetic permeability ) can , in principle , be carried out by following step by step the procedure developed in refs .
finally , we would like to mention that further study on electrodynamics in nonstationary linear media is in progress and the results will be published elsewhere .
yet we expect that the results obtained in this work can be useful to other researchers investigate subjects related to the electrodynamics in conducting and nonconducting media with material properties varying in time .

"the transverse decay constant of the @xmath0 meson ( @xmath2 ) is theoretical input to a number of decays of the b meson . for example
@xmath2 is an important qcd input to the following decays : @xmath3 , @xmath4 , using the light cone formalism  @xcite .
the @xmath2 constant is also input to the decay @xmath5  @xcite that use light cone sum rules .
diehl and hiller  @xcite discuss studying decays of the b meson with final states that include the @xmath1 meson .
there are alternative theoretical formalisms  @xcite to the light cone sum rules such as factorization , that describe the non - leptonic decays of the b meson to final states that include the @xmath1 meson .
so it is important to have a cross - check of the input parameters used in the light cone formalism .
babar has experimentally measured the b decays : @xmath6 and @xmath7  @xcite .
the charmless decays of the b meson , that include those with a @xmath1 meson in the final state , have been reviewed by cheng and smith  @xcite .
the transverse decay constant of the @xmath1 meson is not accessible to experiment , but can be calculated in models  @xcite and sum rules .
calculations of the @xmath1 meson have also been used to tune sum rules  @xcite . in particular ,
the same sum rules are used to simultaneously extract the transverse decay constants of the @xmath1 and @xmath8 mesons  @xcite .    in principle lattice qcd
should be able to produce an accurate result for @xmath2 , particularly as modern lattice qcd calculations usually have multiple lattice spacings and volumes , with pion masses below 300  @xcite .
to the best of our knowledge , there has never been a lattice qcd calculation of @xmath2 before this one .
the @xmath1 meson is a good test case for lattice techniques that deal with resonances , because it is thought to be a basic quark - antiquark meson that decays via s - wave .
the experimental width of the @xmath1(1235 ) is 142(9 ) , and the bulk of the decays are to @xmath9 .
hence further motivation for this study is to compute as much information about the @xmath1 meson from our lattice qcd calculations as possible .
light cone sum rules and factorization methods , also use the decay constants of the @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 mesons to study the decays of the b meson , but there have been previous lattice qcd calculations of those quantities  @xcite .
the transverse decay constant ( @xmath13 ) of the @xmath1 meson is defined  @xcite by @xmath14 where @xmath15 $ ] , and @xmath16 is the polarisation vector of the meson .
it is convenient to introduce the tensor current @xmath17 .
we do not include any momentum in this lattice calculation .
for completeness we note that the @xmath1 meson has @xmath18 .    in the isospin limit
the leptonic decay constant of the @xmath1 meson is zero , because the @xmath19 operator is orthogonal to the vector and axial currents .
although for some quantities , such as the matrix element for @xmath20 mixing  @xcite or the decay constant of the flavour non - singlet @xmath21 meson  @xcite an estimate of isospin violating quantities can be made from a lattice calculation with two degenerate flavours of sea quarks , we do nt see how to estimate the leptonic decay constant of the @xmath1 meson without using non - degenerate light quarks . a formalism to do this
has recently been developed for twisted mass qcd  @xcite .
our lattice calculation uses the twisted mass qcd formalism  @xcite .
once a single parameter has been tuned , twisted mass qcd has non - perturbative @xmath22 improvement  @xcite .
the twisted mass formalism has been reviewed by shindler  @xcite .    .
summary of results for @xmath2 used in this calculation .
@xmath23 is the bare mass of the light quark in lattice units .
the ensemble names are from  @xcite . [
cols='^,^,^,^,^',options='header ' , ]     [ tb : fb1summary ]    in table  [ tb : fb1summary ] we collect together other estimates for @xmath2 .
we have evolved our lattice result to the scale of 1   to compare with the results from sum rules .
the formalism to evolve the decay constant with scale is described  @xcite , that uses input from perturbative calculations by gracey and others  @xcite .
the perturbative factor is 1.095 to evolve @xmath2 from 2   to 1 .    in the non - relativistic quark model
the @xmath1 meson is a p - wave meson with a node in the wave - function at the origin .
this would suggest the transverse decay constant is small .
the partial inclusion of relativistic effects in the quark model  @xcite increases the decay constant .
the results in table  [ tb : fb1summary ] show that @xmath2 is of the same order of magnitude as the pion decay constant ( 132 mev ) , so this is evidence that local interpolating operators will couple to the @xmath1 meson . pragmatically using derivative sources  @xcite with smearing techniques , such as jacobi
, may be useful to get a good signal .
we have presented the first calculation of the transverse decay constant of the @xmath1 meson from lattice qcd .
we obtain @xmath24 = 236(23 ) mev at the physical pion mass . the result is higher than the sum rule results by 3 @xmath25 .
future lattice qcd calculations need to reduce the statistical errors on the correlators , and to directly take into account the resonant nature of the @xmath1 meson .
we thank all members of etmc for a very fruitful collaboration .
we thank prof .
braun for providing the error for the result in  @xcite , and we thank mihail chizhov for useful comments on the paper .

_ , ( 2009 ) , 0910.2802 ," ," we review various b meson decays that require knowledge of the transverse decay constant of the @xmath0 meson 
 . we report on an exploratory lattice qcd calculation of the transverse decay constant of the @xmath1 meson . 
 the lattice qcd calculations used unquenched gauge configurations , at two lattice spacings , generated with two flavours of sea quarks . the twisted mass formalism is used . "
"micro - tpc , a time projection chamber with a micro pixel chamber ( @xmath0-pic ) readout was recently developed for the detection of charged particles@xcite .
the results of a fundamental measurement indicate that some improvements are still required for detecting the minimum ionizing particles ( mips)@xcite .
nevertheless , the results also indicate that low - energy charged particles , which have a large energy loss ( @xmath8 ) , are already detectable by the micro - tpc with dense samplings .
neutron position - sensitive detectors ( psds ) with a large detection area and a capacity for high - rate operation are indispensable for use at neutron beams of the next generation@xcite . since the neutron energy is resolved by a measurement of the time - of - flight(tof ) , a timing measurement on the order of @xmath0s is strictly required .
gaseous neutron detectors filled with @xmath9 have been keenly developed and used because of large cross section to thermal neutrons of about 25 mev . because the energy losses of both the proton and the triton emitted from the @xmath2 ( n , p ( 573 kev ) ) @xmath10 reaction are large , we expect to detect the fine tracks of both particles by the micro - tpc .
we can thus determine the incident position from the detected tracks with a resolution of sub - millimeters .
since gamma - rays are thought to make a large background when used at neutron beams , discrimination between the neutrons and gamma - rays is also important , which should be realized by the measured values , such as the energy losses ( @xmath8 ) .    in this paper , we present the tracking performance of the micro - tpc with energies of around 1 mev .
we then report on the discrimination between the electron tracks ( gamma - ray events ) and the proton tracks ( neutron events ) .
finally , we discuss the development of time - resolved thermal neutron ( @xmath11 25 mev ) psd as an application of the micro - tpc while taking account of the experimental results and simulation studies .
a micro - tpc , a time projection chamber with a micro pixel chamber(@xmath0-pic@xcite ) readout , was recently developed for the detection of charged particles@xcite .
@xmath0-pic is a gaseous two - dimensional psd manufactured by printed circuit board(pcb ) technology .
a schematic of the @xmath0-pic structure is shown in fig .  [
fig : upic ] .
we developed a @xmath0-pic with a detection area of 10 @xmath12 10 @xmath13 and a pixel pitch of 400 @xmath0 m .
cathode strips are formed on one side of a polyimide substrate ( 100 @xmath0 m thick ) , while anode strips are orthogonally formed on the other side .
the results of a fundamental measurement have already been reported in a previous paper@xcite . here , we briefly mention the essential features of the micro - tpc@xcite .
the detection volume of the micro - tpc is @xmath14 with a drift field of 0.4kv / cm .
the micro - tpc can be stably operated at a gas gain of 3000 with ar-@xmath15 flow .
we are optimizing the geometrical structure of the pixels using a three - dimensional simulator@xcite in order to realize a stable operation with a gas gain of @xmath16 .
the signal from each strip is fed to an amplifier - shaper - discriminator ( asd@xcite ) chip , which outputs both an amplified analog signal and a discriminated digital ( lvds ) signal .
lvds signals are in turn read by a position encoding module ( pem ) , which works at a clock rate of 20 mhz .
pem calculates the two - dimensional incident position while taking the anode - cathode coincidence within one clock pulse .
when at least one anode - cathode coincidence is found within the maximum drift time ( 2 @xmath0s ) from the external trigger , or the  @xmath17 
time , the two - dimensional position and the elapsed time from the trigger are recorded . for the energy measurement ,
every 32 analog outputs of the cathode asd chips are summed and digitized by an 8-channel 100 mhz flash adc ( fadc ) . in this way
, we can realize three - dimensional tracking and spectroscopy of the charged particles with the micro - tpc .
we irradiated the micro - tpc with fast neutrons from a radioactive @xmath18(@xmath112mbq ) source , the neutron energy of which peaks between 500 kev and 1 mev .
protons arise from elastic neutron scattering by hydrogen nuclei in @xmath19 .
part of the neutron kinetic energy is transferred to the hydrogen nucleus , i.e. the proton .
the radioactive source was placed 8.5 cm from the aluminum window of the micro - tpc , and an yttrium aluminum perovskite ( yap ) scintillator@xcite(1@xmath12 1  @xmath20 ) was set 3 cm from the radioactive source at the opposite side of the micro - tpc .
the set - up is shown in fig .
[ fig : setup ] .
one fission decay of @xmath18 emits 3.8 neutrons and 9.7 photons on average , therefore , the micro - tpc was triggered by gamma - rays detected by the yap scintillator .
the three - dimensional tracking performance for protons of around 1 mev and a gamma - ray background of several hundred kev were thus measured in this  n/@xmath21-run  .    from all of the measured data , we selected data with a @xmath221 cm and @xmath234 as the track data . here , @xmath24 is the track length calculated by simply connecting the detected points , and @xmath25 is the number of detected points .
several proton tracks with energies between 500 kev and 1 mev are shown in fig .
[ n_tracks ] .
the hardware threshold level at the asd chip was 50 kev / cm , which was low enough to detect sub - mev protons having energy losses larger than 200 kev / cm .
therefore , the detection efficiency was estimated to be almost 100@xmath1 . in fig .
[ edep_track ] , fadc waveforms of the proton tracks are shown . here , the same events are shown in fig . [ n_tracks ] and fig .
[ edep_track ] .
since the elapsed time from the trigger represents the drift length , these waveforms are regarded as the bragg curves .
the directions of the tracks are obviously known from the shape of the bragg curves .    from measurements with @xmath18 ,
the micro - tpc was found to possess sufficient performance to detect the tracks and bragg curves of protons with energies of around 1 mev .
since gamma - rays are thought to make a large background when used at neutron beams , discrimination between the neutrons and gamma - rays is important .
we measured the particle discrimination power by irradiating the micro - tpc with gamma - rays from a radioactive source of @xmath26 .
annihilated back - to - back gamma - rays of 511 kev were emitted from the source .
the micro - tpc was triggered by one of the gamma - rays detected by a yap scintillator , while the other scattered the electrons in the micro - tpc .
this radioactive source was chosen because the gamma - ray energy is close to the @xmath27 value ( 764 kev ) of the @xmath2 ( n , p ) @xmath28 reaction .
thus , the particle discrimination of the 511 kev gamma - rays was measured in this 
@xmath21-run  .
since the @xmath8 of electrons scattered by the gamma - rays were much smaller than those of the neutrons , analog signals were amplified by the gain amplifier((gain = 8) before being digitized by the fadc in the @xmath21-run .
the typical three - dimensional track of the electron ( gamma - ray event ) is shown in fig .
[ gamma_tracks ] . comparing the tracks in fig . [ n_tracks ] and fig . [ gamma_tracks ] , one finds that the proton tracks are more dense and straight than those of the electrons .
consequently , one can assume that the discrimination of the proton tracks and the electron tracks are realized by the energy loss and the fitting results with straight lines .
we defined the energy loss by @xmath29 and @xmath30 by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the detected energy , n is the number of detected points , @xmath33 is the distance between the @xmath34th detected point and the best - fit straight line , and @xmath35 = 270@xmath0 m is the measured three - dimensional spatial resolution of the micro - tpc .
the degree of freedom ( d.o.f ) was three for all of the tracks , since we used the first two and the last two points to calculate @xmath36 .
the @xmath8 distributions of the n/@xmath21-run and the @xmath21-run are shown in fig .
[ dedx_hist ] . in the data of the @xmath21-run
, most events are distributed below 50 kev / cm . on the other hand ,
neutron events with @xmath37 50 kev / cm can be seen in the n/@xmath21-run as well as the gamma - ray peak below 50 kev / cm .
the @xmath38d.o.f distributions are shown in fig .
[ x2_hist ] .
@xmath39d.o.f distribution of the n/@xmath21-run peaks below 3 , because the proton tracks are fitted with the straight lines very well .
we thus define the  neutron region  by @xmath3750
kev / cm and @xmath39d.o.f@xmath40 3 .
when we consider the selection efficiency of the neutrons , the lower limit for the energy loss ( @xmath4150 kev / cm ) is reasonably low compared to the energy losses ( @xmath4 ) of the protons and tritons from the @xmath2(n , p)@xmath28 reaction .
it is apparent that the @xmath36 cut has a very high efficiency from the steep peak in fig .
[ x2_hist ] .
therefore , the selection efficiency for the neutron is thought to be very close to 100@xmath1 .    fig .
[ n_scat ] shows @xmath38d.o.f .
vs @xmath8 plots of the n/@xmath21-run .
neutron events can be seen in the neutron region , while the gamma - ray events are seen out of the neutron region .
the result of the @xmath21-run is shown in fig .
[ g_scat ] . only less than 5@xmath1 of the total events ( 14 of 500 events ) are seen in the neutron region , which indicates that more than 95@xmath1 of the gamma - rays are discriminated by this analysis .    in this measurement with a @xmath26 radioactive source , more than 95@xmath1 of the 511 kev gamma - ray background is known to be discriminated by the @xmath8 and the @xmath36 .
neutron position - sensitive detectors(psds ) with a large detection area and a capacity for high - rate operation are indispensable for use at neutron beams of the next generation@xcite . since the neutron energy is resolved by a measurement of a time - of - flight(tof ) , the timing measurement on the order of @xmath0s is strictly required .
gaseous neutron detectors filled with @xmath9 have been keenly developed and used because of the large cross section to thermal neutrons of about 25 mev .
recently , a ccd - gem based @xmath9 detector was developed , and the performance was studied@xcite .
nice images of the tracks of the proton and triton were obtained , which indicates the potential for the thermal - neutron psd . however , making a large - area detector and high - rate operation could be problematic for practical use at neutron beams .
in addition , the ccd readout is too slow for the tpc ; hence , only two - dimensional tracks are achieved in this readout system .
this feature would deteriorate the quality of the neutron images .    on the other hand , the micro - tpc with a large detection area is easily manufactured and high - rate operation up to 7.7 mhz with the @xmath0-pic was actually realized@xcite .
three - dimensional trackings help to determine the incident position with a spatial resolution of sub - millimeters .
fine spatial resolution is strictly required for the neutron diffraction imaging , because the incident angle is determined by the incident position .
therefore , the micro - tpc is an appropriate detector for time - resolved neutron psd with @xmath2 .
the principle of the @xmath2 neutron detector is @xmath2 ( n , p ( 573 kev ) ) @xmath10 .
we have already shown that the micro - tpc possess sufficient performance to detect the tracks and bragg curves of the proton emitted from this reaction .
we subsequently studied the tracks of both particles by a simulation , and evaluated the development of the time - resolved thermal neutron ( @xmath11 25 mev ) psd as an application of the micro - tpc .
we calculated the energy depositions of protons and tritons along the tracks by geant4 ( ver 5.0 patch-01)@xcite .
a gas mixture of ar-@xmath15-@xmath9(@xmath42 ) at 1 atm was used for the calculation .
we did not take account of the ionization of @xmath6he for the energy deposition because its amount is vary small .
the result is shown in fig .
[ pro_tri_track ] .
the track length ( 1.2 cm ) and the @xmath8 of both particles ( @xmath43 200 kev / cm ) are reasonable for detection by the micro - tpc . the protons and the tritons are easily distinguished from the bragg curves .
as a result , the incident position is determined with a spatial resolution of sub - millimeters .    from a measurement with a @xmath44na source ,
more than 95@xmath1 of the 511 kev gamma - ray background was known to be discriminated by @xmath8 and @xmath36 . for practical use , the total energy deposition ( @xmath32 ) is also used to discriminate the low energy gamma - rays that have large @xmath8 . with this total energy cut , almost complete gamma - ray rejection will be realized . in this way
, we reject the gamma - ray background almost completely , which is another appropriate feature of the neutron psd as an application of the micro - tpc .
this neutron psd is operated with the gas at normal pressure .
we can thus reduce the materials needed for the high - pressure gas enclosure , which is useful for a better image of the neutrons .    from simulation studies and the experimental results ,
we conclude that a time - resolved neutron psd with a spatial resolution of sub - millimeters shall be developed as an application of the micro - tpc .
we are developing a @xmath0-pic with a detection area of 30 @xmath45 30 @xmath46 .
we will soon increase the clock rate of the encoding system from 20 mhz to 100 mhz , because the current spatial resolution is dominated by this clock rate . with these improvements
, we are quite sure that we can develop a time - resolved neutron psd as an aplication of the micro - tpc .    the parallax error could be problematic for a non - pressurized 8cm - thick tpc .
one solution to avoid it is to build a curved detector so that one of the two parallax errors will not be observed . because the @xmath0-pic is a thin ( @xmath11100@xmath0 m ) polyimide sheet , curved detectors can , in principle , be manufactured .
another solution is to determine the start timing of the drift by detecting the gas scintillation light so that the interaction position would be determined three - dimensionally with a resolution of sub - millimeters .
the study on the gas scintillation seems to be one of the most important tasks of ours in the near future development .
@xmath47 gas , which is a common gas for the @xmath9 neutron detector because of its large stopping power ( for shorter tracks ) and small z ( for less gamma - ray background ) , would also be useful for this purpose , because its scintillation wavelength fits the detection by the photomultipliers@xcite .
total light yield from the @xmath47 gas by the neutron capture reaction of @xmath2 is estimated to be @xmath48 photons , which seems to be enough to trigger the tpc with a timing resolution of @xmath1110ns even with a photomultiplier coverage of a few @xmath1 and its quantum efficiency of @xmath49 at 600 nm . in this way
, we think the parallax error could be avoided with some more improvements of the micro - tpc .
the results on the tracking performance and the particle discrimination indicate a strong possibility the application of the micro - tpc as a dark matter detector . actually , our results are comparable to those shown in ref .
@xcite concerning the points of tracking performance and discrimination .
we are going to study the detector response to low - energy nuclear recoils in order to estimate the feasibility for a dark matter detector .
three - dimensional tracks and the bragg curves of the protons with energies of around 1 mev were clearly detected by the micro - tpc .
we also showed that more than 95@xmath1 gamma - rays of the 511 kev were discriminated , while the efficiency to the neutrons of the same energy range was retained at @xmath11100@xmath1 .
simulation studies showed that the total track length of the proton and the triton emitted from the @xmath2(n , p(573 kev))@xmath3 reaction is about 1.2 cm , and that both particles have sufficient energy losses ( @xmath4 ) in 1 atm ar+@xmath5+@xmath6he(@xmath7 ) .
these values suit the current performance of the micro - tpc , and we conclude that a time - resolved neutron psd with a spatial resolution of sub - millimeters shall be developed as an application of the micro - tpc .

"in the past decade untargeted ( `` blind '' ) surveys revealed the existence of new types of transients .
a good example is the case of superluminous supernovae ( slsne ) : despite of being at least an order of magnitude brighter than `` normal '' supernovae @xcite , slsne were not discovered before 2005 , presumably because of the absence of their birthplaces ( low - luminosity galaxies and/or galaxy cores ) in the pre - selected target lists of earlier transient surveys @xcite .    the texas supernova search ( * ? ?
* tss ) discovered the first two slsne , sn  2005ap @xcite and sn  2006gy @xcite that became prototypes of two distinct subclasses within slsne ( see @xcite for details on discoveries ) .
its successor , the rotse supernova verification project ( * ? ? ?
* rsvp ) , continued to find slsne , e.g. sn  2008am @xcite or sn  2008es @xcite . both surveys used most extensively the 0.45-m rotse - iiib telescope at mcdonald observatory , texas . although the target fields covered mostly rich galaxy clusters closer than @xmath4 mpc , the majority of the discovered transients ( @xmath5 to date ) occured in significantly more distant , background galaxies .
the details of the search and detection strategies are described in @xcite .    in this paper
we report the discovery of yet another unusual transient , detected with rotse - iiib in the course of rsvp in 2009 .
the internal name of the transient was _ dougie _ , but sometimes it was also designated as rotse3j120847.9 + 430121 .
although the early light curve ( lc ) and the first spectra taken with the 9.2-m hobby - eberly telescope ( het ) suggested a new slsn , follow - up spectroscopic observations did not reveal any broad spectral features , which is unusual even among slsne that sometimes show peculiar spectral evolution .
instead , the spectra continued to show only a smooth , cooling continuum up to a month after discovery . at the last epochs when the transient was detected , narrow features due to the presumed host galaxy started to appear , then the transient faded below the het detection limit .    subsequent spectroscopic observations with the keck telescope confirmed the existence of the host galaxy at redshift of @xmath2 .
this redshift corresponds to a distance of @xmath6 mpc , which , when combined with photometric data , implies an observed absolute peak brightness of @xmath7 mag , similar to that of the brightest slsne ( see sect .
3.1 ) . here
we present a detailed account of the unique observational properties of _ dougie _ as well as an in depth description of various model alternatives for its origin .
this paper is organized as follows . in 
2 the photometric and spectroscopic observations for both the transient and the host galaxy are presented . in 
3 four alternatives for _ dougie _ s origin are explored : a core - collapse supernova , a ns - ns merger , a grb jet observed off - axis and a tidal disruption of a low - mass stellar object by the central supermassive black hole , the latter of which is favored by the data .
finally , in  4 we summarize our results and present our conclusions .
during its normal course of operation at mcdonald observatory , texas , rotse - iiib detected a new object at r.a.= @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) , dec.= @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) .
the first detection occured on mjd 54852.31 ( 2009 jan 21 ut 07h 26 m 24s ; ut dates are used throughout this paper ) , supplemented by the next detection at ut 07h 52 m 24s confirming the presence of the new object . at the time of discovery the apparent brightness of the transient was @xmath12 mag ( all rotse - iiib unfiltered magnitudes
have been converted to @xmath13-band magnitudes via usno - b1.0 and sdss photometric calibrations , see @xcite ) .
the rotse internal naming system identified the transient as _
the position of the transient was checked in the sdss dr10 catalog , and a very faint object , sdss j120847.77 + 430120.1 was found at @xmath14 arcsec distance from _ dougie_. the object looks slightly more extended than nearby stars on the combined sdss dr10 frame , thus , the sdss pipeline classified this object as a galaxy and determined a photo - z = @xmath15 @xmath16 as the redshift estimate .
our subsequent spectroscopic observation (  2.5 ) confirmed the galaxy classification .
we propose that this object is the host galaxy of the transient , and show below that our measurements support the likely extragalactic origin of _
dougie_.      tracing back in the rotse observational archive , the earliest detection of _ dougie _ was found on the frames obtained at 4 days before discovery ( mjd 54848.34 , 2009 jan 17 ) when the ot was at @xmath17 mag .
the last pre - discovery non - detection ( limiting magnitude @xmath18 mag ) occurred on 2009 jan 15 ( mjd 54846.3 ) , 6 days before discovery . in the following
we assume that the outburst started during the 2 days between the last non - detection and the first successful detection , and set the `` moment of first light '' as @xmath19 = mjd 54847.3 @xmath20 ( hereafter we use the term `` first light '' to refer to the first observable appearance of the transient , thought to be the moment of shock breakout in sne , for example ) .
photometric follow - up observations with rotse - iiib started immediately after discovery , and continued up to 2009 feb 15 when _ dougie _ was at @xmath21 mag .
additional photometric data were collected by _
swift_/uvot in 3 optical ( @xmath22 ,  @xmath23 ,  @xmath24 ) and 3 ultraviolet ( uv ) filters ( @xmath25 ,  @xmath26 ,  @xmath27 ) after triggering _ swift _ in target - of - opportunity ( too ) observing mode .
the uvot observations started on 2009 jan 28 and continued up to 2009 march 26 when the transient was below or close to the detection limit of uvot in all filters .
[ fig : swift1 ] illustrates the temporal evolution of the ot on uvot @xmath22-band frames .
photometry of _ dougie _ was computed applying aperture photometry on the _
swift_/uvot level-2 ( sky ) frames , using the calibration by @xcite .
the photometry on the rotse - iiib frames was performed by psf - fitting on the template - subtracted frames .
the results were converted to @xmath13-band magnitudes as noted above .
all photometric data are collected in table  [ tab : rotse ] and [ tab : uvot ] .
the light curves are shown in fig .
[ fig : lc ] .
the redshift of _ dougie _ s host galaxy was estimated spectroscopically ( see  2.3 ) as @xmath28 , which corresponds to a luminosity distance of @xmath29 mpc assuming @xmath30-cdm cosmology with @xmath31 km  s@xmath32  mpc@xmath32 .
using this distance , the observed peak @xmath13-band magnitude ( @xmath33 mag ) translates to -22.6 mag absolute . as noted above
, this peak brightness is comparable to that of the most luminous slsne .
.[tab : rotse ] rotse - iiib photometry of _ dougie _ [ cols='^,^,^,^ ' , ]     @xmath34rest - frame days since outburst assuming @xmath35 mjd and @xmath36 + @xmath37signal - to - noise measured at 6000     all spectra were reduced in the standard way using iraf .
wavelength calibration was done based on combined exposures of cd and ne spectral lamps .
flux calibration was computed using spectra of spectro - photometric , flux standard stars taken on the same nights when the transient was observed , which provided reliable relative fluxes for the object s spectra .
absolute flux levels were determined by matching the het spectra with the flux densities from contemporaneous _
swift_/uvot @xmath23 and @xmath24 observations .
the observed spectral sequence is plotted in fig .
[ fig : sp ] , where the individual spectra have been shifted vertically for clarity , and also doppler - corrected back to the host galaxy s rest frame assuming @xmath36 ( see below ) .
the spectra are dominated by a smooth , hot continuum without any obviously noticeable spectral feature . at later phases ( after feb 20 ) weak narrow features appeared between 4000  6000   rest - frame wavelengths , which are probably due to contamination from the host galaxy ( see  2.3 ) .
the combined optical + uv spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of _ dougie _ was constructed by combining the het spectra with the _ swift_/uvot photometric flux densities taken close to the spectroscopic observations .
these seds were then corrected for milky way extinction using @xmath38 @xcite .
reddening within the host galaxy was ignored because of the lack of information on this parameter , but the very blue observed color of the transient during the early phases argues against significant in - host extinction . finally , the flux contribution from the host galaxy was also subtracted from the combined uv - optical seds .
this correction was negligible during the early phases , but increased considerably when the transient evolved after maximum .
[ fig : sed ] plots the temporal evolution of the sed in rest - frame days .
the sed peak is observed to gradually shift from 2200   at + 10 d to 4600 at + 36 d , corresponding to @xmath39 k and @xmath40 k wien - temperatures , respectively .
the flux depression between 2500 - 3000   appearing after + 25 d might be due to the broad uv - features observed in the spectra of the slsn ps1 - 10bzj @xcite and the tde candidate ps1 - 11af @xcite ; however , the resolution provided by the broadband _ swift _ uv filters are not adequate to unambiguously identify these features .
alternatively , the `` uv - bump '' appearing on + 36 d might be caused by the red leak of the _ swift _ uv - filters .
the seds in fig .
[ fig : sed ] can not be described by a series of single - temperature blackbodies : the optical continuum may suggest a higher temperature , but the increasing flux decline in the uv is inconsistent with the hot blackbody assumption .
it is possible that the uv is affected by strong blending due to ionized metal lines , as usual in sne ; however , without having a well - resolved uv spectrum , such a conclusion can not be proven unambiguously .
the earliest spectra of _ dougie _ appeared similar to those of some slsne observed with het , showing mostly a hot , featureless continuum .
this is illustrated in the left panel of fig .
[ fig : sne ] , where the jan 25 spectrum ( + 8 day phase after first light in rest - frame ) is plotted together with the early - phase het spectra of two h - rich slsne : sn  2008am @xcite and sn  2008es @xcite .
it is clearly observed that , unlike sn  2008am , _ dougie _ did not show either hydrogen- or any other spectral features .
sn  2008es was similarly absent of features in the early spectra , but its late - time spectra ( not shown here ) contained strong , unambiguous sn features including balmer - lines @xcite . on the contrary , as seen in fig .
[ fig : sp ] , none of _ dougie _ s observed spectra show sn - like features .
[ fig : sne ] also illustrates that the continuum slope of _ dougie _ s early - phase optical spectra is relatively well described by a power law with @xmath41 .
pure , hotter blackbody spectra are incompatible with the uv sed .
the observed spectra of _ dougie _ can not be accurately modeled by either an evolving single - temperature blackbody or by a power - law spectrum with a fixed slope .
the right panel of fig .
[ fig : sne ] shows a similar comparison between the last observed spectrum of _ dougie _ ( + 37 days after first light , or + 30 days after the peak of the light curve , both measured in rest - frame ) and spectra of sn  2010kd ( vinko et al . in prep . ) , and ptf12dam @xcite .
contrary to the early - phase spectrum in the left panel , this late - phase spectrum of _ dougie _ is redder than the other slsne at similar post - peak phases .
this and the lack of the spectral features make the spectral evolution of _ dougie _ being quite different from both h - rich and h - free slsne .    we can not rule out that the lack of broad sn features in _
dougie _ s spectra might be simply due to an observational effect .
the broad sn features might have appeared only at later times when the transient faded below the het detection limit .
although this scenario can not be excluded , this seems improbable if _ dougie _ is thought to be similar to other fast - evolving slsne , like sn  2008es , which occurred at a similar distance . in sn  2008es
the broad sn features started to appear after + 20 rest - frame days @xcite , while in _ dougie _ they failed to appear for at least + 38 rest - frame days .
similar hot , featureless spectra have also been observed in more recent slsne such as ps1 - 10bzj @xcite and css121015 @xcite ; but , again , there are important differences in the observed spectral evolution between these slsne and _
dougie_. css121015 was a slowly evolving h - rich slsn ( its light curve peaking at + 40 d rest - frame ) , which developed broad h , caii , mgii and feii features after + 100 d @xcite .
by contrast , ps1 - 10bzj was a h - poor slsn showing rapid evolution , and by + 16 d rest frame it had also developed the usual , broad features common to all h - poor slsne @xcite .
although slsne show some degree of diversity in their observed properties , the lack of any broad spectral feature in _ dougie _ s spectra during the entire observable window is unprecedented to date .
the candidate host for _ dougie _ is the galaxy sdss j120847.77 + 430120.1 .
the sdss @xmath42 psf ab - magnitudes for this object are @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) , @xmath45 ( 0.052 ) , @xmath46 ( 0.025 ) , @xmath47 ( 0.036 ) , @xmath48 ( 0.059 ) , while its photo - z is @xmath15 @xmath16 according to the sdss dr10 database .
there is no detected object in the galex database closer than 10 arcsec to this position . adopting @xmath49 mag as the limiting magnitude for the galex all - sky survey , the background - corrected flux upper limit for the host
is @xmath50 erg s@xmath32 @xmath51 @xmath32 in both the nuv ( @xmath52  ) and the fuv ( @xmath53  ) bands .
the lack of uv detection is consistent with the photometric and spectroscopic optical observations ( see below ) . also , there is no known x - ray or radio source in the vicinity of _ dougie _ s position .
according to the simbad database , the closest radio source ( wn  j1208 + 4301 ) is @xmath54 arcmin away and is not related to the host .
we have observed the candidate host galaxy with the double - channel low resolution imaging spectrometer ( lris ) @xcite mounted on the keck - i telescope on 2009 nov 11.6 ut ( mjd 55146.60 ) .
the spectrum is plotted together with the broad - band sdss fluxes in fig .
[ fig : host ] . a sb - type galaxy template taken from @xcite
is also shown for comparison .
cross - correlation between the observed and the template galaxy spectra revealed @xmath36 @xmath55 as the optimum estimate for the redshift of the host , which is adopted for this paper .
this spectroscopic redshift is consistent with the photo - z estimate derived from the sdss photometry .
note that there is no indication for either the presence of an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) , or any ongoing star formation in the host galaxy spectrum .
these would produce strong , unambiguous , narrow emission lines that are not observed in the galaxy spectrum .
the bright , fast - rising transient appeared slightly offset from the centroid of the host galaxy as reported in the sdss dr10 catalog . since the position of _ dougie _ within the host galaxy can be key for interpreting its physical origin , here we investigate this issue in more detail .    in order to estimate the uncertainties associated with
_ dougie _ s position , we first co - added _
swift_/uvot frames obtained on jan 31 and feb 03 ( + 10 and + 15 rest - frame days , respectively ) , when the ot was observed with the highest signal - to - noise .
we then register the _ swift _ frames to the sdss r - band frame of the same area by matching the positions of common point sources on both frames .
next , we determine the coordinates of _ dougie _ on the registered _ swift _ frames and compared them to those of the photometric centroid of the host galaxy as measured on the sdss r - band frame . the results are shown in fig .
[ fig : pos ] , where the _ swift _ minus sdss coordinate differences ( in arcseconds ) are plotted as @xmath56 r.a . and @xmath56 dec .
open symbols represent the coordinate differences for the reference objects , while the filled symbols denote the position of _ dougie _ with respect to the host photo - center .
[ fig : pos ] reveals that that the reference objects scatter around the zero point more - or - less isotropically , and there is no obvious systematic shift between the data obtained on the epochs of the two _ swift _ observations . on the other hand , _ dougie _
appears to be systematically offset , about 1.2 `` east and 0.4 '' south from the center of the host , in both observed epochs . adopting the wcs of the sdss frame
, we measure the final position of _ dougie _ as r.a.= @xmath57 ( @xmath9 ) , dec.= @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) .
we note that the uncertainties for _ dougie _ plotted in fig .
[ fig : pos ] are conservative @xmath60-pixel errors of the _ swift _ frames that may overestimate the true errors of the photo - centers .
the coordinate uncertainties given above are in between the @xmath60-pixel errors and the measured frame - to - frame shift of the photometric center of the ot ( @xmath61 pixel ) on the _ swift _ frames .
based on our _ swift _ observations , we infer that _ dougie _ appears to be slightly off - center from its host galaxy .
the total angular distance from the photo - center of the host is @xmath62 arcsec , corresponding to @xmath63 kpc linear distance for the adopted redshift ( @xmath28 ,  2.4 ) .
the bolometric lightcurve ( lc ) of the transient was assembled by integrating the host - corrected uv+optical seds ( fig .
[ fig : sed ] ) over wavelength .
the fluxes in the far - uv were estimated by linearly extrapolating the spectrum until 1000  . in the ir ( longward of 8000  ) ,
a rayleigh - jeans tail starting from the reddest observed flux was assumed to calculate the integrated ir contribution to the total quasi - bolometric flux .    the temporal coverage of the lc was refined by adding more data points from the rotse @xmath13-band and swift @xmath24-band lcs ( fig .  [ fig : lc ] ) .
this was justified by the close similarity between the shape of the lcs at optical wavelengths . to do this , the observed rotse- and swift magnitudes
were converted to absolute magnitudes using a @xmath29 mpc luminosity distance , then the luminosity curve was calculated from these absolute magnitudes as if they were bolometric magnitudes , which is equivalent of assuming bc = 0 mag bolometric correction .
although this seems like a rather crude approximation , the resulting lc ( plotted in fig .
[ fig : bolom ] ) looks consistent with those obtained from sed integration .
the peak bolometric luminosity of _ dougie _ is thus estimated to be @xmath64 erg s@xmath32 , while the integrated radiated energy is calculated to be @xmath65 erg .
in this section we consider four models for the origin of _ dougie _ : core collapse supernova , merging neutron stars , off - axis grb models and the tidal disruption of a star by the central supermassive black hole .
these are presented in detail in the following subsections .
although the lack of sn features in the optical spectra does not support the core collapse hypothesis , the lc look rather similar to those of slsne . for this reason , in the absence of spectral information
one could have naturally deduced that _ dougie _ might have resulted from the death of a massive star that was recently formed in the host galaxy .    in the left panel of fig .
[ fig : bolom ] we compare the bolometric lcs of _ dougie _ with those of several slsne .
the data of the latter objects were analyzed by @xcite where the reader may find the references to the data .
it is seen that _ dougie _ showed faster lc evolution than most of the well - observed slsne .
the rise - time to peak , @xmath66 days , was similar to that of ptf09uj , a luminous type iin sn @xcite .
however , as fig .
[ fig : bolom ] shows , the peak luminosity of _ dougie _ clearly puts it into the slsn regime .
in this subsection we make an effort to describe the lc using simple sn radiative diffusion models to ascertain whether or not they can provide a reasonable description of the bolometric lc . following the formalism developed by @xcite , we test three different core collapse scenarios : a _ ni - co _ radioactive decay model , a magnetar model @xcite and a shocked , circumstellar medium ( csm ) model .
the best - fit representations of the lc are plotted in fig .
[ fig : bolom ] .
all three models assume that the energy is deposited at the center of an optically - thick sphere , promptly thermalized , and then slowly transported out by photon diffusion . in the radioactive decay and magnetar modes we assume homologous expansion of the sn ejecta ( which is taken into account when solving the diffusion equation ) , while in the csm model we assume a fixed , opaque csm cloud whose interior is thermalized at a designated time .
the fast rise and decay of the observed lc can be fit only using a relatively short effective diffusion timescale , which corresponds to a low ejecta mass in all three scenarios .
the high peak luminosity , on the other hand , requires very large internal energy to be readily available . in the radioactive decay model ,
in particular , the derived diffusion timescale , @xmath67 days , implies @xmath68 for @xmath69 @xmath70  g@xmath32 and @xmath71 km  s@xmath32 , while the large peak luminosity demands a ni - mass @xmath72 . in the magnetar model
, the early peak requires a short ( @xmath73 days ) spin - down timescale which , in turn , requires a relatively large magnetic field strength of about @xmath74 g for an initial 10 ms spin period .
moreover , the magnetar model also needs a relatively low - mass ejecta ( @xmath75 @xmath76 ) , but a very extended initial radius of @xmath77 cm .
in addition , this model requires the internal energy to be injected near the edge of the very tenuous sn ejecta to avoid significant adiabatic degradation .
the csm model gives a more physically consistent picture with a required total shocked energy of about @xmath78 erg ( compatible with the explosion energy of a typical sn ) deposited within a csm cloud of about @xmath79 @xmath76 . in this scenario
_ dougie _ resembles to ptf09uj @xcite , i.e. the luminosity is due to the conversion of shock kinetic energy into thermal energy within the opaque , dense csm .
the higher luminosity of _ dougie _ might be explained by the larger kinetic energy and denser , more massive csm than in the case of ptf09uj .
however , the weakness of this hypothesis is that , unlike in ptf09uj , there is no indication for any shock - generated emission lines in the spectra of _ dougie _ , which are ubiquitously observed in interacting type iin sne . in principle
, the lack of hydrogen and/or helium emission lines might be consistent with the presence of a h / he - free , o - rich csm around the transient , but the lack of _ any _ kind of spectral feature during the whole observed period makes this hypothesis less feasible .
the other important observational constraint that argues against the core - collapse slsn scenario is the nature of the host galaxy (  2.5 ) .
there is growing evidence that h - free slsne tend to appear in metal - poor , dwarf galaxies that show intense star formation rates and extremely strong emission lines @xcite .
since the host of _ dougie _ appears to be dominated by older populations of stars without any sign of enhanced star formation , these observed properties of the host galaxy strongly argue against the slsn nature of _
dougie_.      merging neutron stars ( ns - ns mergers , or `` merger - novae '' )
are thought to be promising candidates for producing fast , luminous transients @xcite .
recently , the rapid optical transient ptf11agg @xcite was proposed to be due to such a phenomenon @xcite . in this model
the merging of two neutron stars due to gravitational wave radiation is speculated to produce , in some cases , a rapidly spinning , hypermassive , magnetized neutron star @xcite surrounded by a more - or - less spherical , fast - expanding ( @xmath80 ) envelope , the mass of which is @xmath81 @xmath76 .
the magnetar wind is assumed to efficiently dissipate poynting flux within the expanding envelope , heating it and accelerating it to relativistic speed ( @xmath82 ) .
the dilution of the envelope due to expansion causes the thermalized photons to escape on timescales anywhere between hours and days depending primarily on the mass of the surrounding envelope and its expansion velocity .
thus , the basic physical configuration , to some extent , is similar to the magnetar model considered in  3.1 .
the main difference being the mass of the ejected envelope , which in the sn model is at least an order of magnitude larger .
while the stable , hypermassive neutron stars model could produce lcs with shapes that are qualitatively similar to that of _ dougie _ , i.e. rapid rise followed by slower decline , the calculations by e.g. @xcite and @xcite show rise times that are significantly shorter ( typically between 10 hours - 1 day ) than the @xmath0 days observed rise time of _ dougie_. this is essentially due to the smaller ejected mass in the ns - ns merger systems and its corresponding higher expansion velocity . as it was shown in  3.1 , the observed lc of _ dougie _
needs @xmath83 days , which is almost a factor of 10 longer than the typical diffusion timescales expected in ns - ns merger systems .
therefore , we conclude that the predictions of the merger model are not compatible with the observed lc of _
dougie_.      given that most gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are collimated into narrow jets , their observed properties will unavoidably vary depending on the angle @xmath84 from their symmetry axis at which they are observed . if _
dougie _ were a grb , then at least its gamma - ray emission directed at us was certainly extremely weak .
a plausible interpretation might be that the _ dougie _ was a typical grb seen at an angle , @xmath84 , larger than the opening angle of the central jet , @xmath85 .
if we assume a homogeneous sharp - edged jet , the burst seen by all observers located within the initial jet aperture , @xmath86 , is practically the same , but beyond the edges of the jet the emission declines precipitously @xcite . when @xmath87 , there is no detectable prompt emission and the accompanying early afterglow is weak , owing to relativistic beaming of photons away from the line of sight . as the lorentz factor decreases with time
, an off - axis observer will see a rising afterglow light curve at early times peaking when the jet lorentz factor reaches @xmath88 and approaching that seen by an on - axis observer at later times .
this is because an observer will receive most emission from those portions of a grb blast wave that are within an angle 1/@xmath89 to the direction to the line of sight such that the emission for an off - axis observer will remain at a very low level until the doppler cone of the beam intersects the observer s line of sight .
this can be seen by comparing the @xmath86 and @xmath90 light curves in fig .
[ fig : oag ] .
the off - axis grb interpretation of _ dougie _ requires the viewing angle to have been @xmath91 ( fig .
[ fig : oag ] ) , similar to the parameters determined by @xcite for ptf11-agg . the afterglow light curves at @xmath92 hz presented here
are calculated using the afterglow models of @xcite by applying the boxfit code . in these models ,
the expansion of the grb jet in a uniform medium with density @xmath93 is calculated using relativistic hydrodynamical simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?
* ; * ? ? ?
* ; * ? ? ?
the local emissivity is computed using the conventional assumptions of synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons that are accelerated behind the shock into a power - law distribution ( @xmath94 ) , where the electrons and the magnetic field hold fractions @xmath95 and @xmath96 , respectively , of the internal energy of the shocked fluid @xcite .
one question that naturally arises is whether the observed multi - wavelength evolution can be explained within the framework of this model .
even though the model fits the optical light curves moderately well , it is inconsistent with the observed sed and , in addition , predicts significantly higher x - ray fluxes when compared with the _ swift_/xrt upper limits .
this is illustrated in fig .
[ fig : oag2 ] , where the predicted synchrotron spectra ( solid lines ) are compared with the observed sed .
this argues against an off - axis grb origin for _
dougie_.      the tidal disruption of an approaching star by a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) has become a popular mechanism for explaining the bright , slowly evolving x - ray / uv / optical `` flares '' from luminous transients ( see e.g. * ? ? ?
* ; * ? ? ?
* ; * ? ? ?
* and references therein ) .
tdes are characterized by the following basic quantities : smbh mass @xmath97 , stellar mass @xmath98 , stellar radius @xmath99 , and the impact parameter , the ratio of the tidal radius @xmath100 to the distance of the closest approach @xmath101 , as @xmath102 @xcite .
when the debris from a disrupted star falls back to the smbh , it first forms an elliptical accretion disk from which matter circularizes via a combination of mechanisms @xcite .
the temporal evolution of the fallback rate @xmath103 is thought to be characterized by a range of power law values @xmath104 , where @xmath105 depends on the star s structure and the impact parameter @xmath106 @xcite .
the conversion of the fallback into light is not expected to directly follow @xmath103 , especially for individual bands @xcite . as gas accretes onto the black hole
, radiation pressure may expel some fraction of the mass if the accretion rate exceeds the eddington limit of the black hole , @xmath107 .
when this condition is satisfied , a wind may be produced that carries a significant amount of kinetic and thermal energy @xcite . for cases in which the accretion rate remains sub - eddington , the disk component likely becomes the dominant source of radiation , peaking in the far uv to soft x - ray bands ; however , previous tde candidates have shown evidence of significant reprocessing of the emergent light into longer wavelengths with an sed characterized by a single blackbody , rather than the sum of blackbodies expected for an accretion disk @xcite .    even in the observed bands , which do not include the peak in the sed at early times ( see fig
[ fig : sp ] ) , the peak luminosity of dougie , @xmath108 ergs s@xmath32 , is larger than the eddington limit of a @xmath109 black hole . additionally , dougie s time of peak is significantly shorter than the time of peak predicted from @xmath103 alone , which for a @xmath110 black hole is on the order of a month for main - sequence stars @xcite .
both of these aspects suggest that if _ dougie _
is indeed a tidal disruption event , its observational appearance near peak must be dominated by a wind component whose functional form may not directly reflect @xmath103 .    to model
_ dougie _ , we modified the tdefit code initially described in @xcite to include a wind component that can carry a significant fraction of the accretion energy .
the appearance of a tde when its accretion rate exceeds eddington has been explored by a number of authors @xcite . for super - eddington accretion rates ,
these models presume a fraction of the incoming mass is ejected in the form of a wind , which moves out at some velocity that is comparable to the orbital velocity at the tidal disruption radius
. if the majority of the energy carried by the wind is internal , the radiative output can be significantly less than the energy input , as much of the energy will be expended as work as the wind expands @xcite .
if the excess energy is instead mostly carried kinetically , but then dissipates near the photosphere , the radiative output can be comparable to the energy input .    while these works provide descriptions of the relevant wind physics in the decline phase , they do not provide formalisms that are general enough to model _ dougie _ over its full evolution : rise , peak , and decline .
additionally , each model has a particular prediction for the power - law relationship between @xmath103 and the photosphere s properties .
as an example , _ dougie _ shows a clear decrease in temperature as a function of time after peak ( fig .
[ fig : sp ] ) , whereas @xcite and @xcite predict a temperature increase until the event drops below the eddington limit .
@xcite , by contrast , do predict a slight temperature decrease after peak .
[ fig : tdelc ] shows the comparison of the r - band lc of _ dougie _ with that of another tde - candidate , ps1 - 10jh @xcite .
it is seen that the two events had markedly different light curves : _ dougie _ showed a much faster and more energetic outburst than ps1 - 10jh .
modeling of ps1 - 10jh has shown that a standard thin - disk alone is not capable of fitting the event s light curve @xcite , but that a large fraction of the disk s light needs to be intercepted by a reprocessing region to adequately match observations .
we propose that the reprocessing region intercepts a fraction , @xmath111 , of the disk radiation .
the reprocessing region is likely to be hydrostatic when the accretion rate is sub  eddington , but to become dynamic and unbound when the eddington limit is exceeded .
the subsequent dynamic expansion then releases energy that originates from a combination of the radiation from the disk and radiation from the expanding reprocessing region , @xmath112 we assume @xmath113 is capped at the eddington luminosity , and @xmath114 is equal to the fraction of reprocessed disk light plus a fraction @xmath115 of the eddington excess , @xmath116 where we have presumed that the maximum amount of energy released in the form of an outflow is given by the energy release at the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) , @xmath117 , where the black hole efficiency @xmath118 depends solely on the black hole s spin parameter @xmath119 . as in @xcite
, we do not presume an _ a priori _ time - dependence of the photosphere on @xmath103 , its optical depth @xmath120 , its size @xmath121 , or its temperature @xmath122 , but rather leave these as free parameters . because this model does not presume a particular power - law relationship between @xmath103 and the reprocessing region s properities
, the model space includes the specific power - law index proposed in @xcite and @xcite , which would be favored by the markov - chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) optimization if they are able to reproduce dougie s observed evolution .
one simplification made here is that we presume the power - law relationship between @xmath103 , @xmath121 , and @xmath122 is constant throughout the event , regardless of whether the event is above or below the eddington limit , whereas @xcite and @xcite advocated a transition at the eddington limit .
we find that such a transition is not necessary to produce satisfactory fits ( fig .
[ fig : tde1 ] ) , but relaxing this assumption may improve fit quality .    beside the parameters described above ( @xmath123 , @xmath98 , @xmath106 , @xmath119 , @xmath121 , @xmath120 and @xmath115 ) the model also includes the following additional parameters
( see * ? ? ? * for more complete description ) : the power - law index @xmath124 in the relationship @xmath125 ; the disk inclination angle @xmath126 ( @xmath127 indicating face - on ) ; the disk viscosity parameter @xmath128 ; the polytropic index @xmath129 of the disrupted star ( either @xmath130 or @xmath131 ) ; the hydrogen column density @xmath132 within the host galaxy ; the reddening - law parameter @xmath133 .
we assumed that the time - lag between the disruption and the first detection is @xmath134 ( in days ) , and we added @xmath135 variance ( in magnitudes ) to the model light curves .      in table
[ tab : tde ] we show the median values resulting from our maximum - likelihood analysis .
as expected , the short peak timescale and high luminosity of _ dougie _ favors a low mass black hole , although there is very large scatter in the favored black hole mass ( @xmath136 ) so that the black hole mass might be as large as @xmath137 .
if we assume that the host galaxy s light is dominated by a bulge component , the black hole mass it would possess based on the @xcite relation would be @xmath138 ; however as the galaxy is sb type , its bulge fraction may be as low as @xmath139 @xcite , suggesting a central black hole mass of a few @xmath110 .
this value is within the scatter of the black hole mass distribution found here .
another possibility is that the tidal disruption occurred about a secondary , smaller black hole in the process of merging with galaxy s primary black hole , which would also explain the tde s slight offset from the host s center .
lower mass ( @xmath140 - @xmath141 @xmath76 ) black holes , even off - center ones , although rare , are not unprecedented .
a good example is in ngc  3341 , where recent merging resulted in two off - center nuclear sources ( at @xmath73 and @xmath142 kpc from the center of the massive disk galaxy ) , one of them being a seyfert-2 nucleus @xcite .
another lower mass accreting bh ( @xmath143 @xmath76 ) was recently discovered in the central region of the dwarf starburst galaxy henize 2 - 10 @xcite .
the more recent detection of a radio outburst from the ultra - luminous x - ray source hlx-1 in eso 243 - 49 may be due to a jet ejection from an intermediate - mass ( @xmath144 - @xmath145 @xmath76 ) bh @xcite .
as illustrated by these examples , the off - center position ( @xmath146 kpc ) of _ dougie _ , as well as the bh mass derived in the tde - model , are not unrealistic , and may be consistent with the tde - hypothesis .    a number of differences in _ dougie _ s highest - likelihood parameters are apparent when comparing to fits of ps1 - 10jh .
the best - fitting photosphere power - law index we find is small , @xmath147 .
this parameter is related to the temperature power - law index by the expression @xmath148 @xcite .
this implies that @xmath149 , close to the expectation of @xmath150 for a blackbody the luminosity of which is proportional to @xmath103 with a fixed @xmath121 .
[ fig : ph ] shows that the photosphere grows to a few @xmath151 cm ( top panel ) , at velocity comparable to the escape velocity at @xmath152 ( middle panel ) , the terminal velocity for a wind launched from that location @xcite .
the photosphere grows beyond the distance to which both the bound debris and unbound tidal tail have traveled since the time of disruption , suggesting that it must be continually accelerated ; however , as the area of the photosphere increases more slowly than @xmath103 , @xmath122 also rapidly increases near peak and then cools off slowly at later times ( fig .
[ fig : ph ] , bottom panel ) .
for ps1 - 10jh , it was found that the reprocessing region s temperature was inversely related to @xmath103 @xcite .

the models also favor nearly 100% conversion of both the kinetic energy from the wind and radiative energy from the disk into energy radiated by the reprocessing photosphere ( i.e. @xmath192 and @xmath193 ) , suggesting that the wind component is completely dominant .
this conclusion is bolstered by the strong upper limits in the x - rays from swift ( see section [ sec : xray ] ) that suggest @xmath194% of the radiative output emerges with energies above 200 ev .
our highest likelihood models suppress the total x - ray output to @xmath195 erg s@xmath32 ( fig .
[ fig : tdesed ] ) .
by contrast , the reprocessing zone in ps1 - 10jh was found to only intercept @xmath196 of the disk s radiative output . to see if such a high conversion factor was necessary , we performed a test tdefitrun in which @xmath115 was fixed to 0.1 , this yielded a poor fit and tended to even lower black hole masses ( @xmath197 ) .
the low x - ray flux also suggests that if a jet were produced ( e.g * ? ? ?
* ) , it was at the very least not pointed towards earth , and the high conversion ratio into the reprocessing zone may be the result of the jet being intercepted by a thick , super - eddington accretion flow @xcite .    aside from these differences , the favored stellar mass ( @xmath198 ) , impact parameter ( @xmath199 , indicating a full disruption for the favored @xmath129 ) , black hole spin ( @xmath200 ) , and viscous parameter ( @xmath201 ) are all typical values expected for a main - sequence disruption , suggesting that this event would be representative of disruptions about lower - mass black holes if it is in fact a tidal disruption .    .

as a summary , we draw the following conclusions :    1 .   we discovered an optical transient ( nicknamed _ dougie _ ) which was most probably of extragalactic origin .
it appeared on top of a faint galaxy having @xmath28 redshift corresponding to @xmath203 mpc distance .
our follow - up observations in the optical and uv - bands revealed that the light curve of the transient showed a quick rise ( with rise time of @xmath0 days ) followed by a subsequent decline resulting in a @xmath204 month - long observability with our resources .
the observed lc suggested a peak luminosity of @xmath205 erg s@xmath32 , which is similar to those of the most luminous slsne .
simultaneous x - ray observations with _ swift _ resulted in no detected x - ray emission on the co - added _ xrt _ frames spanning the whole duration of the follow - up observations .
our spectroscopic follow - up observations showed that the spectra of the transient were unusual : between 4000 and 9000   it did not show any spectral feature that could be attributed to the transient , during the whole observed interval .
the weak narrow features in the late - time spectra were identified as due to the host galaxy . at early times
the spectra consisted of a hot , blue continuum ( @xmath206 k ) , which later cooled down , but could not be described as a single blackbody from the uv to the red .
the softening of the spectra suggested a cooling , expanding , sn - like ejecta , but the lack of spectral features during the entire observed time domain argued against the sn - hypothesis .
the proposed host galaxy , sdss j120847.77 + 4320.1 , is a faint sb - type galaxy , without any previously detected uv / x - ray emission , and without any sign of ongoing star formation .
the transient appeared @xmath62 arcsec off - center , corresponding @xmath207 kpc linear distance from the photo - center of the host ( 2@xmath191 ) .
despite the similar peak luminosity , it is unlikely that the transient was a super - luminous supernova .
traditional sn models based on radioactive decay are ruled out because of the order - of - magnitude difference between the required amount of @xmath1ni mass ( @xmath208 @xmath76 ) and ejecta mass ( @xmath204 @xmath76 , from lc rise time ) .
the magnetar - powered , and the csm - interaction - powered slsn models can be tweaked to produce a similar lc , but the difference between the usual spectra of these kind of transients and that of _ dougie _ does not support the slsn hypothesis . also , the lack of ongoing star formation within the host galaxy is not typical for galaxies producing h - poor slsne , as those slsne tend to appear in metal - poor hosts showing intense star formation .
5 .   merging neutron stars that can produce fast , luminous transients , where the remnant collapse is halted when a rapidly rotating , hypermassive magnetar is produced , usually result in light curves that evolve much faster than _
dougie_. their predicted rise times , @xmath2091 - 2 days @xcite , are in contrast to the observed @xmath0 days rise time of _ dougie_. 6 .
based on the similarity of the hot featureless spectra to the early spectra of grb - sne , afterglow models by @xcite were fit to the lc and seds of _
dougie_. both the shape and the peak of the lc could be explained by a jet - induced afterglow having parameters more - or - less similar to those derived by @xcite for ptf11-agg .
all such models , however , fail to reproduce the observed sed evolution .
the tidal disruption scenario was explored by fitting the event to an amended version of the model presented in @xcite .
the tde model yielded a good fit to the photometric and spectral evolution of the flare , with the highest - likelihood models suggesting a disruption of a solar - mass star by a black hole .
the bh mass turned out to be on the low - end of predictions for the associated host galaxy . due to the slight offset of the flare from the host s center , this may be attributable to a recent merger of a lower - mass galaxy with the host .
the tde model also finds that the flare must have been very super - eddington at peak with a near full conversion of energy released at the isco into energy radiated at its photosphere .
as no x - rays were detected from the flare , there is no direct evidence for the existence of a jet , suggesting that the jet was `` smothered '' by the super - eddington accretion flow , which is consistent with the near - full conversion of accretion energy into radiative output .
the other parameters of the disruption yielded by our analysis are as expected of a typical disruption .
we thus conclude that _ dougie _ could represent a canonical tde about lower - mass central black holes .

the nasa ads and ned services were extensively used during the entire project , and the availability of these services are also gratefully acknowledged ." ," we present follow - up observations of an optical transient ( ot ) discovered by rotse on jan . 21 , 2009 . 
 photometric monitoring was carried out with rotse - iiib in the optical and _ swift _ in the uv up to + 70 days after discovery . 
 the light curve showed a fast rise time of @xmath0 days followed by a steep decline over the next 60 days , which was much faster than that implied by @xmath1ni - @xmath1co radioactive decay . 
 the sdss dr10 database contains a faint , red object at the position of the ot , which appears slightly extended . 
 this and other lines of evidence suggest that the ot is of extragalactic origin , and this faint object is likely the host galaxy . a sequence of optical spectra obtained with the 9.2-m hobby - eberly telescope ( het ) between + 8 and + 45 days after discovery revealed a hot , blue continuum with no visible spectral features . 
 a few weak features that appeared after + 30 days probably originated from the underlying host . 
 fitting synthetic templates to the observed spectrum of the host galaxy revealed a redshift of @xmath2 . at this redshift 
 the peak magnitude of the ot is close to @xmath3 , similar to the brightest super - luminous supernovae ; however , the lack of identifiable spectral features makes the massive stellar death hypothesis less likely . 
 a more plausible explanation appears to be the tidal disruption of a sun - like star by the central super - massive black hole . 
 we argue that this transient likely belongs to a class of _ super - eddington _ tidal disruption events . "
"white dwarf asteroseismology offers the opportunity of directly constraining mass , core composition , envelope composition and stratification , spin rate , and magnetic field strength @xcite .
the zz  ceti h - atmosphere white dwarfs ( wds ) pulsate in normal modes of oscillation ( @xmath5-modes ) where buoyancy is the restoring force @xcite .
these stars exhibit pulsations when they enter the instability region , a discrete strip in the @xmath6@xmath7 plane that spans 11,000 @xmath8 12,250k at @xmath9 .
this strip has been extensively observed and constrained by numerous sources @xcite and is likely pure ; i.e. , all cooling wds pulsate as they evolve through the instability strip .
these data offer insight into the evolution of wds @xcite .
the lowest mass wd known to pulsate is he  0031 - 5525 at @xmath10 and @xmath11k and a mass of @xmath120.5@xmath13 @xcite .
the known zz  ceti pulsators are certainly c / o - core wds , where the theoretical understanding has been focused @xcite .    starting with @xcite and @xcite ,
there has been a growing realization that many wds have @xmath14 , implying core masses lower than expected for c / o - core wds .
these are expected to be he wds made from the truncated red giant branch ( rgb ) evolution of @xmath15@xmath13 stars @xcite . to form a he wd
, a process removes mass from the h envelope , quenching the h - shell burning that grows the he core to ignition .
two modes of evolution have been proposed to truncate rgb evolution : mass loss due to binary interaction and mass loss due to stellar winds .
as a progenitor star ascends the rgb , its radius increases rapidly , eventually filling the roche lobe , and mass transfer begins . if unstable , this mass transfer initiates a common envelope event @xcite ejecting the envelope from the red giant as the he - core and companion spiral into shorter orbital periods @xcite .
it is this physics that leads to the expectation that he wds should be in binary systems @xcite .
however , surveys have uncovered significant numbers of he wds that do not appear to be in binary systems @xcite . in stars of high metallicity , the increased opacity in the envelope due to metals can drive very strong stellar winds that cause mass loss in excess of 0.5@xmath13 during the rgb phase @xcite .
therefore , it is possible that high metallicity stars may lose enough mass on the rgb due to stellar winds to avoid he core ignition and thus leave @xmath16@xmath13 he wds as remnants .
direct evidence for this scenario is scarce , but may exist in the over - luminous low mass he wds in the globular cluster ngc  6791 @xcite .
it is clear that this wind mass loss scenario can not produce low mass he wds .
once formed , he wd evolution is different from that of c / o wds because nuclear burning may still play a significant role , especially when @xmath17@xmath13 .
studies of millisecond pulsars suggest that many he wds are born with thick @xmath1810@xmath1910@xmath20 h envelopes @xcite .
these thick h envelopes develop long diffusive tails into the he core where the higher densities and temperatures can cause them to ignite @xcite .
this ignition highlights a dichotomy in the evolution of he wds . for he
wds of @xmath210.180.20@xmath13 ( dependent upon metallicity ) the h envelopes are radially thin enough that thin - shell instabilities develop and a series of rapid thermonuclear flashes occur .
these flashes burn away the envelope leaving only a thin layer of h which allows for rapid cooling on timescales of 10100s of myrs . for he
wds of @xmath220.180.20@xmath13 , the nuclear burning is stable and provides a dominant energy source that slows the cooling evolution of the wd to timescales of several gyrs @xcite . from an observational standpoint , very low mass he wds ( @xmath230.2@xmath13 ) may spend significantly more time in a zz  ceti like instability strip than the higher mass he wds . however , no systematic search for their pulsations has been undertaken .
this is the goal of our work .    some differences from the c / o - core zz  ceti stars are expected .
@xcite used very low mass he wd models ( @xmath230.2@xmath13 ) with stable h burning envelopes and the brickhill convective driving criterion @xcite to locate he wd pulsation candidates .
the result of this work is seen in the 
blue ' edge boundary depicted between @xmath246.06.5 in figure [ fig : obscand ] . clearly , many theoretical issues remain in pinpointing the precise location of the blue edge , such as the effects of convective efficiency and the use of more detailed fully non - adiabatic calculations , which may move this boundary by several hundred kelvin @xcite . for normal mass
he wds ( 0.20.45@xmath13 ) , the blue edge of the instability strip has not been theoretically determined ( though , see @xcite from some preliminary calculations ) and so we naively extrapolate the empirical boundary of the zz  ceti stars as determined by @xcite and connect it to the very low mass he wd boundary . given the many theoretical uncertainties and naive extrapolations , the boundary depicted in figure [ fig : obscand ] is meant only to highlight the parameter space in which to carry out our search .    in this paper
we present our search for he wd pulsators . in section [ sec : find ] , we describe our selection criteria for observing candidate pulsators using objects culled from a multitude of sources . in section
[ sec : obsstrat ] , we describe our observational strategy and analysis procedures . in section [ sec : obssum ] , we present our observations of 12 candidate objects and our detection limits .
no significant pulsations have been detected , however , our detection limits may provide interesting constraints on theory as we describe in section [ sec : conc ] .

to select he wd candidates for observation we generally select only those wds with @xmath51 ( a mass @xmath230.45@xmath13 ) and @xmath52k . we select a larger range of temperatures than suggested by zz  ceti properties ( and the theoretical analysis of @xcite ) , as non - detections will constrain the parameter space in which the conventional theory must hold
. of added interest is the potential detection of pulsations in parameter space not predicted by theory .
we find most of our candidates from surveys looking for other phenomena , e.g. the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , but we have also found candidates in single object papers .
companions to pulsars have been found to be good candidates such as psr  j1911 - 5958a @xcite and psr  j1012 + 5307 @xcite .
@xcite offers a catalog of wds within the sdss that is the largest to date .
they found their wds by selecting sdss spectra using a series of color cuts and then fitting to a large grid of wd atmospheric models .
objects with spectral contamination due to a companion star , e.g. an m - dwarf star , were not de - contaminated and thus the spectral fits obtained were often erroneous .
this is an issue for he wds as their primary formation channel requires a binary companion which frequently contaminates the spectrum .
many of these contaminated spectra were reanalyzed by @xcite and @xcite in two catalogs of close binary systems . in these cases ,
the derived parameters of @xcite and @xcite were used .
since the sdss sample did not target wds specifically , the quality of the spectra of many of the wds is low as is the model fits derived from them .
therefore , we generally do not pursue sdss targets unless additional spectra have been taken .
a few sdss objects were observed early in our program before this contamination was well understood .
@xcite performed a hypervelocity star survey looking for b - type stars escaping the galaxy .
they used sdss photometry to color select their b - type stars and gathered high signal - to - noise spectra to search for large radial velocities .
given their color selection , @xcite made great use of this data - set , uncovering many low mass he wds .
@xcite and @xcite have used a similar technique to the @xcite survey and searched for hypervelocity stars in proper motion data from a variety of sources ( @xcite , new luyten two tenths , nltt , proper motion survey ) .
their survey has discovered some of the lowest mass wds known @xcite .
these surveys revealed dozens of candidates , only 12 of which are observed ; see table [ tbl : candsum ] .
of these 12 objects , 10 are potential he wds and 7 are very low mass he wds .
the observations we executed followed a simple strategy .
@xcite showed that the expected periods of pulsations range between 250 and 1,000 seconds . extrapolating our knowledge of the zz  ceti stars we considered a fiducial amplitude of 10 mmags .
we designed each observation to be sensitive to these properties by incorporating a fast cadence ( usually less than 60 seconds ) and individual measurements of the target that met or exceeded 10 mmags in precision ( in the poisson limit , 10,000 photons / image ) . in table
[ tbl : detobs ] we report on the details of our observations .

apphot_. the only exception to this analysis is psr  j1911 - 5958a where unique hst observations required a different approach which will be discussed later .
we performed differential photometry using multiple comparison stars inversely weighted to their intrinsic variance over a single run of observation ( a technique similar to that used in @xcite and @xcite ) .
we ensure all comparison stars are non - variable by comparing each prospective star within the field - of - view with all others in every combination and use periodograms to ensure no periodic trends are present .
we employ a variable aperture algorithm to optimize the signal - to - noise of our photometry in order to deal with the varying psf . for each observation ,
a single representative frame was selected . for every star in the image we varied the size of the photometric aperture to find that size which optimized the signal - to - noise of the measurement .
the optimum apertures were then scaled by the average fwhm of 2d - gaussians fitted to each star .
for all other images the average fwhm of the stellar psfs was measured and then scaled using the appropriate optimum scaling .
therefore , as the seeing fluctuates during an observation the apertures are adjusted larger or smaller ( a technique similar to that used in @xcite ) .
once we have constructed the light curve for our target star there are often long timescale trends still present in the data , usually caused by the color - airmass effect .
we correct for this effect by correlating our light curve with airmass and dividing a fitted trend from the light curve . for some observations
this trend removal is insufficient as other systematics may be present ( e.g. variable sky background due to the moon ) .
in these cases low order polynomials ( third order or less ) are used to remove this power .      to detect pulsations in our light curve
, we use a lomb - scargle periodogram @xcite because our observations are frequently unevenly spaced and sometimes filled with large gaps . in the zz  ceti stars ,
low amplitude pulsations show pulse shapes that are closely approximated by sinusoids while high amplitude pulsations frequently show narrow peaks in their shape @xcite .
we feel this justifies our use of a periodogram which is optimized for sinusoidal signals because the pulsations that are  in the noise ' are closely represented by sinusoids .
high amplitude pulsations , though non - sinusoidal , should still be easily detected as they will likely be well above the noise .
we have not found any significant pulsations from he wds . however , detection limits are still useful in both deciding if additional observations are required and constraining theory .
we measure our detection limits by using signal injection and the properties of a lomb - scargle periodogram . for a periodogram normalized by the variance of the total light curve ,
a false - alarm probability is naturally generated that states for @xmath54 independent frequency bins the probability that independent and normal noise produces power greater than @xmath55 in any of the frequency bins is @xmath56 @xcite .
thus , a signal may be considered 90% significant if it has a false - alarm probability of 10% .
however , our noise may not be precisely normal and independent due to potential unresolved pulsations and other systematic effects ( such as atmospheric correlated noise ) that may cause our data to be slightly correlated .
this may cause us to slightly overestimate our detection limits .
our simulations of normal random data distributed with the same errors as our light curves have shown , however , that this effect is minimal .
we thus determine our detection limits by injecting sinusoidal signals , integrated over the observation s exposure times , at a single frequency and test all phases .
we then increase the amplitude of the signal until 90% of all phases produce a peak in the periodogram at the injected frequency that is 90% significant .
finally , all frequencies accessible by the data are tested with this method . a low frequency limit to the accessible frequencies is derived by testing the low frequency content of the comparison stars where we do _ not _ correct for color - airmass or other long period trends .
we report the low frequency limit as the highest frequency where the red - noise power drops below the 50% false - alarm probability level .
all frequencies below this limit will be affected by the color - airmass and long period trend corrections and are thus not reliable .
for all observations , this low frequency limit is a few times larger than the sampling limit of the inverse of the observation length . in all cases in this paper ,
the detection limits were largely independent of frequency allowing us to state one detection limit over a range of frequencies .
the results of our observations are shown in table [ tbl : results ] and summarized in the next section and table [ tbl : candsum ] .

in the course of this paper , several observing setups were employed . here
we summarize the details of the telescopes and instrumentation used .
the william hershel telescope ( wht ) is a 4.2-m telescope at the roque de los muchachos observatory on la palma in the canary islands .
we used the acam imager and the sdss-@xmath53 filter with a circular @xmath57 diameter field - of - view in a 2@xmath582 pixel binning mode for an effective spatial resolution of @xmath59 . using the fast readout mode
we maintain a total dead - time of @xmath1211s between exposures .
all observations using this setup were carried out using service time , generally at bright time ( near the calendar full moon ) .
the wisconsin indiana yale noao ( wiyn ) telescope is a 3.5-m telescope at the kitt peak national observatory in arizona .
we used the optic imager @xcite and the broadband filter bg-39 ( @xmath60 nm ) with a @xmath61@xmath58@xmath61 field - of - view in a 2@xmath582 pixel binning mode for an effective spatial resolution of @xmath62 .
the total dead - time between exposures was @xmath1210s .
all observations using this setup were carried out in a single observing run that occurred in late - may and early - june 2007 .
the palomar 60-inch ( p60 ) telescope is a 1.5-m robotically controlled telescope at the palomar observatory on mount palomar in southern california .
we used the p60ccd imager and the gunn-@xmath5 filter with a @xmath63@xmath58@xmath63 field - of - view with a spatial resolution of @xmath64 .
we decreased readout times by reading out half of the two ccd chips for a total dead - time between exposures of @xmath122040s .
the large variation in dead - time was due to a software issue in the telescope software .
this setup was used in late 2006 and early 2007 , however , most of the data taken during that time was for other projects or was too degraded by weather .    the faulkes telescope north ( ftn ) is a 2.0-m robotically controlled telescope on haleakala , hawaii and is part of lcogt .
we used the merope imager and the sdss-@xmath53 filter with a @xmath65@xmath58@xmath65 field - of - view in a 2@xmath582 pixel binning mode for an effective spatial resolution of @xmath62 .
the total dead - time between exposures was @xmath1222s .
this setup was used in late - december 2009 and early - january 2010 .
we used the wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) uvis channel and the f200lp filter ( @xmath66 nm ) on hst . to decrease readout times and to avoid onboard memory buffer overflow we used the uvis1-c512a - sub subarray , a 512@xmath58512 pixel sub - section of the ccd .
this gave us a @xmath67@xmath58@xmath67 field - of - view and a total dead time of 55s .
this setup was used in march 2010 for 4 orbits ( 6 hours ) .
most of our observations and objects were routine and the results are well summarized in tables [ tbl : candsum ] , [ tbl : detobs ] , and [ tbl : results ] and figures [ fig : j0822][fig : psrj1911 ] . however , a few of our objects and observations require special discussion .
* sdss  j1330 + 0127 * was observed once using the wiyn / optic setup .
no pulsations were detected to a limit of 44mmags over a frequency range of 0.35mhz .
this observation was plagued by intermittent cirrus clouds and a near full moon creating a high sky background .
this object has a measured @xmath68 and @xmath69k @xcite .
the sdss spectra were likely contaminated by a companion star s flux . a re - analysis by @xcite measured @xmath70 and @xmath71k .
this object is likely not a he wd .    * sdss  j1435 + 3733 * is a partially eclipsing binary system of a c / o wd and m - dwarf discovered by @xcite using the ftn / merope setup .
all frames in eclipse were removed for pulsation analysis .
no pulsations were detected to a limit of 4mmags over a frequency range of 0.917mhz .
this object has a measured @xmath72 and @xmath73k @xcite .
the sdss spectra were definitely contaminated by a companion star s
flux @xcite . a re - analysis by @xcite and @xcite measured @xmath74 and @xmath75k which gives a derived model mass of 0.41@xmath13 , near the c / o wd and he wd composition boundary .
* sdss  j2049 + 0005 * was observed once using the wiyn / optic setup .
no pulsations were detected to a limit of 21mmags over a frequency range of 0.47mhz .
this observation was plagued by intermittent cirrus clouds and a near full moon creating a high sky background .
this object has a measured @xmath76 and @xmath77k @xcite .
@xcite noted multiple minima in their model fits as well as discrepant sdss-@xmath53 band flux compared to best fit models and suggested a @xmath78 was likely .
@xcite confirmed this finding and conclude that this star is likely a distant a2 star .
* sdss  j2240 - 0935 * was observed four times using the p60/p60ccd setup .
no pulsations were detected to a limit of 14mmags over 0.67mhz .
this object has a measured @xmath79 and @xmath80k @xcite .
the sdss spectra were likely contaminated by a companion star s flux . a re - analysis by @xcite measured @xmath81 and @xmath82k .
* nltt  11748 * is the first totally eclipsing detached double white dwarf binary system discovered by @xcite using the ftn / merope setup .
all frames in eclipse were removed for pulsation analysis .
no pulsations were detected to a limit of 4mmags over 0.27mhz .
this object has a measured @xmath83 and @xmath84k @xcite with a derived mass of 0.18@xmath13 .
@xcite found direct evidence for doppler beaming in a long timescale photometric survey .
the doppler beaming signal was removed in the low order polynomial division in the reduction and should only affect frequencies less than 0.1mhz ( half the orbital period of 5.6hours ) . in the future , eclipse and radial velocity analysis will produce a high precision measurement of the masses and radii of both components in this object . since its discovery , three additional eclipsing he wd
binary systems have been discovered @xcite .
* psr  j1012 + 5307 * was observed one time using the wht / acam setup .
no pulsations were detected to a limit of 20mmags over the frequency range of 0.2 - 7mhz .
this object has a measured @xmath85 and @xmath86k with a derived model mass of 0.18@xmath13 @xcite and also @xmath87 and @xmath88k with a derived model mass of 0.21@xmath13 @xcite .
neither of these measurements is obviously superior .
* psr  j1911 - 5958a * was observed one time using the hst / wfc3 setup over 4 orbits .
the photometric analysis for this object was uniquely different than all other objects . due to crowding in the field ( psr  j1911 - 5958a is in a globular cluster ) as well as the unique psf of hst ,
aperture photometry is not the most precise method .
psf - fitting photometry is ideal since the psf of the wfc3 instrument is well understood ( jay anderson , private communication ) .
we used the psf - fitting software developed by jay anderson ( similar to @xcite ) to extract the photometry from our data . since most atmospheric and sky effects are nonexistent in space , variable aperture photometry was not required or used .
we used 36 comparison stars with magnitudes between 17.525.0 to ensure the quality of our photometry . due to a stray light artifact ,
our background was increased by @xmath1230% .
no pulsations were detected to a limit of 16mmags over the frequency range of 0.05 - 3.25mhz .
this object has a measured @xmath89 and @xmath90k with a derived model mass of 0.18@xmath13 @xcite .
of the 12 objects we observed in this paper , seven are likely very low mass ( @xmath230.2@xmath13 ) he wds . whether or not these observations offer strong constraints on theory
is currently an open matter .
first we must consider the accuracy of the @xmath7 and @xmath6 measurements that place these objects within the predicted pulsation parameter space .
unfortunately , very low mass wd atmospheres are not well understood . due to their low surface temperatures ( @xmath91,000k ) ,
the h atmospheres are not sufficiently ionized and neutral broadening of the h absorption lines plays an important role .
the theory of neutral broadening is not well understood and may account for significant errors in line widths ( @xcite ; private communication , detlev koester ) .
as such , the reported errors on @xmath7 and @xmath6 for these objects are always the statistical error of the fit to theoretical atmosphere grids and do not take into account the uncertainties of the theory itself which can increase the uncertainty by as much as a factor of two or more ( private communication , detlev koester ) .
further , the uncertainty of the atmosphere theory is likely not random but rather a shift in a specific direction in the @xmath6@xmath7 plane , affecting the parameter space location of all very low mass he wds .
this is why nltt  11748 is such an important eclipsing binary system @xcite . as a potential double - lined spectroscopic eclipsing binary , it could offer high precision _ model independent _ determinations of both the mass and radius of the he wd component providing a high precision constraint on its gravity for which any atmospheric gravity measurement must match .    of added concern is the location of the instability strip  blue ' edge itself .
@xcite derived the  blue ' edge to be where pulsation modes of eigenvalues @xmath92 and @xmath93 were driven .
this offers a temperature upper limit to the @xmath92 instability strip because the  blue ' edge shifts redward when higher radial orders of @xmath94 are considered . in the few cases where
pulsation mode eigenvalues have been identified observationally ( e.g. hl  tau  76 , @xcite ; g117-b15a and r548 , @xcite ) the highest amplitude observed modes range in @xmath94 from 1 to several 10s . if very low mass he wds preferentially only excite the higher radial order modes , then the blue edge could shift redward by a few 100k potentially removing our three best candidates from the potential instability region
. uncertainties in the precise convective efficiency and the lack of a detailed non - adiabatic analysis could further shift this blue edge by another several 100k in either direction @xcite .
an additional observational concern is whether our detection limits are truly meaningful . only nltt  11748 , lp  400 - 20 , sdss  j0822 + 2743 , and sdss  j1435 +
3733 met our fiducial pulsation limit of 10mmags and only nltt  11748 , sdss  j1435 + 3733 , and sdss  j2240 - 0935 were observed more than once .
it is well known that pulsation amplitudes can be small , 34mmag , and vary in detectability from one night to the next @xcite .
therefore additional observations are required for many of our objects to both tighten their detection limits and gain multiple epochs of observation so that these null detections can be even more convincing .    finally , the theoretical analysis by @xcite involved only an extension of the brickhill convective driving criterion using adiabatic assumptions which may not be valid at the lower gravities of the very low mass he wds .
further , very little theoretical work has been done between 0.2 - 0.45@xmath13 @xcite . to address these concerns , an extension of the non - adiabatic driving work by @xcite and @xcite
should be used to firmly predict the location of the he wd instability strip .

support for program number hst - go-11581.01-a was provided by nasa through a grant from the space telescope science institute , which is operated by the association of universities for research in astronomy , incorporated , under nasa contract nas5 - 26555 ." ," the recent plethora of sky surveys , especially the sloan digital sky survey , have discovered many low - mass ( @xmath0 ) white dwarfs that should have cores made of nearly pure helium . 
 these wds come in two varieties ; those with masses @xmath1 and h envelopes so thin that they rapidly cool , and those with @xmath2 ( often called extremely low mass , elm , wds ) that have thick enough h envelopes to sustain @xmath3 years of h burning . in both cases , 
 these wds evolve through the zz ceti instability strip , @xmath4,00012,000k , where @xmath5-mode pulsations always occur in carbon / oxygen wds . 
 this expectation , plus theoretical work on the contrasts between c / o and he core wds , motivated our search for pulsations in 12 well characterized helium wds . 
 we report here on our failure to find any pulsators amongst our sample . 
 though we have varying amplitude limits , it appears likely that the theoretical expectations regarding the onset of pulsations in these objects requires closer consideration . 
 we close by encouraging additional observations as new he wd samples become available , and speculate on where theoretical work may be needed . "
"near @xmath23 , the electron wavefunction may be taken as proportional to @xmath141 , with small @xmath142 , independent of layer index .
only @xmath143 is relevant to the spectrum in this small range of momentum , and small terms of order @xmath0 can be treated perturbatively .
the form of @xmath143 is simplified by the transformation @xmath144 with @xmath145}$ ] , and the transformed @xmath143 now has only one nonzero matrix element . with the unitary transformation ,                        ^+_1,2=-^-_1,2=w , where @xmath147 is positive and we assume @xmath148 , @xmath149 . defining ket vectors in terms of eigenstates of @xmath150 , @xmath151 and the constant @xmath152 ,
the normalized eigenvectors are given by                                            < ^+_1|h_1|^+_2>=-k_2 .
these matrix elements define an approximate projection of @xmath158 into the positive eigenvalue subspace of the @xmath26 hamiltonian in eq .
[ hsp ] . a correction to this
can be included in the diagonal elements in eq .
( [ diagonal ] ) using second - order perturbation theory , with the negative energy states , eqs .
[ eigenstate_m1 ] and [ eigenstate_m2 ] , being the intermediate states . using              for the purpose of computing the @xmath1-matrix , we may choose any convenient gauge .
the wavefunctions well away from the saddle point have distinct in - coming and out - going characters on either side of it , so that a gauge transformation does not affect the @xmath1-matrix itself . to compute the @xmath1-matrix
we adopt landau gauge , so that introducing the vector potential can be implemented via the substitution @xmath161 , while @xmath67 remains unchanged .
the energy reference is set by @xmath162 .
the corresponding equations for the two - band model become          -+(e-v_a)(v_b - e)=0+o(_b^-4).[webber ] for the band containing the saddle point , @xmath166 .
the factor @xmath167 on the left - hand side of the above equation in this situation has the form of an inverted parabola in the neighborhood of @xmath96 , which can be approximated as            = _ b^2 . from this expression one
may compute the @xmath1-matrix using standard methods as described in the text .
incoming and outgoing states on either side of @xmath168 correspond to such states for the original hamiltonian , and this same @xmath1-matrix connects the amplitudes for those states .
the expressions for @xmath169 and @xmath170 in the main text are obtained by setting @xmath171 for the purpose of simplifying the expressions ; the actual numerical computation still uses the expressions listed here .                        ) _ , [ prop1 ] in which the parameter @xmath172 encodes the boundary condition between the edges of the doubled bz , and the basic @xmath1-matrix @xmath106 is given in the main text .
the 2x2 unitary matrices ,            ) , specify the boundary conditions . the subsequent phase accumulation between saddle points @xmath23 and @xmath173 ( arc 1 and 6 in first bz ) and that between @xmath107 and @xmath34 ( arc @xmath174 and @xmath175 in the second bz ) is represented by                ) _ , [ prop2 ] in which @xmath176 .
the quantities @xmath177 and @xmath178 appearing in the exponent combine to give the areas between the numbered arcs and the @xmath67 axis .
we shall represent these areas in terms of the five elementary areas @xmath179 defined in fig .
[ bzbox ] .
before we proceed to show how the representation of area is done , one should notice that arcs 1 and 6 ( see fig .
1 in the main text ) in first bz should sweep out identical areas since the orbits are symmetric about the @xmath67 axis and move in opposite directions .
the same is true for arcs @xmath174 and @xmath175 in the second bz .
one may show that    @xmath180 is the shading area associated with arc 1 in the top - left of fig .
[ bzbox ] .
it can be seen that @xmath181 is the negative ( brown ) area contributed from the left side of circle , and @xmath182 is the positive ( green ) shaded area .
similarly , one may show that the area associated with arc @xmath175 is @xmath183 note that the overall minus sign is due to the choice of circulation of those closed trajectories specified by the arrow in fig.[bzbox ] . continuing the same procedure ,
one can write down the relations at the saddle point @xmath34 and @xmath173 ,                          ) . the reordering matrix @xmath184 implements the property that the @xmath34 and @xmath173 sp s scatter trajectories between different bz s .
@xmath4 is another phase angle parameter encoding the eigenvalues under the mt operators .
the next phase accumulation is given by                    ) _ , [ prop4 ] with the area @xmath185 specifying the phase along arcs 3 and 5 ( top - right in fig .
[ bzbox ] ) , and @xmath186 specifying the phase along arcs @xmath187 and @xmath188 ( bottom - right in fig .  [ bzbox ] ) .
finally , the scattering at @xmath35 and @xmath189 may be written as                                  ) _ .
[ prop6 ] the corresponding areas for arcs 2 and 4 are the same as those for arcs 1 and 6 , and arcs @xmath190 and @xmath191 are the same as for arcs @xmath174 and @xmath175 .

.      a_ab+a_bc+a_caa=2a+2b+c . for energies below that of the saddle point ,
one finds ( excluding corrections of order @xmath192 ) @xmath193 , which corresponds to the circular area associated with the trajectories of energy below that of the saddle point . moreover ,        for energy sufficiently below the saddle point , @xmath103 , the basic s - matrix reduces to @xmath195 , which leads to all @xmath196 s equal identity matrix as well . because the sum of @xmath125 s vanishes and the sum of @xmath124 s equals the dirac circle area , it is easy to show that eq .  8 in the text reduces to        ( i)^3 e^iae^-i e^i e^-i=(-i)e^iae^-ix , where we have written @xmath200
we have also used the facts that @xmath201 in the brackets anticommutes with @xmath202 , that its square is the unit matrix .
eq . 8 in the text
then reduces to          = 0 .
note that we have set @xmath203 in all expressions in this supplement except the last one .
the inclusion of boundary conditions specified by @xmath4 and @xmath172 can be shown to yield identical spectra away from the saddle point . however , for energies close to the saddle point , the magnetic states are indeed altered by these parameters .
this is illustrated in fig .
[ ll1 ] below , which show how the states in a range of energies behave for various values of @xmath204 .
.representation of the area between the portions of trajectories ( see fig .  1 in main text for numbering ) and @xmath67 axis using the five elementary areas shown in fig.[bzbox ] of the supplement .
the pair of numbered arcs appearing in the same row correspond to the same area due to the orbit symmetry with respect to @xmath67 axis and the fact that they move in opposite directions .
arcs 1 , 3 , @xmath175 , and @xmath188 are four representative orbits for demonstrating the areas in terms of the elementary ones @xmath179 in fig .

circles in top row are the trajectories of top layer in first bz , while those in bottom row are for the trajectories of bottom layer in second bz ( see fig .  1 in main text ) .
because the orbits are symmetric about the @xmath67 axis , arc 1 in top - left is the representative of arcs @xmath205 all of which under the specified circulation correspond to the same area listed in table [ area_table ] .
similarly , arc 3 on top - right , arc @xmath175 on bottom left , and arc @xmath188 on bottom right are the representative ones .
the five elementary areas @xmath179 specified by either shape or color are listed in the right column . referring to the circle in bottom - right , the circle of area @xmath206 with @xmath207
is divided into three distinct parts , the gold box in the middle of area @xmath208 , the side of area @xmath209 and the top / bottom portion of area @xmath210 .
the green box of area @xmath211 in top - right and the purple box of area @xmath212 in bottom - right are different because the dirac points ( the center of circle ) in top and bottom rows have different distances , @xmath213 and @xmath214 , respectively , from the @xmath67 axis.,scaledwidth=65.0% ]     and @xmath172 .

, title='fig:',scaledwidth=30.0% ]" ," we consider magnetic breakdown in twisted bilayer graphene where electrons may hop between semiclassical @xmath0-space trajectories in different layers . 
 these trajectories within a doubled brillouin zone constitute a network in which an @xmath1-matrix at each saddle point is used to model tunneling between different layers . 
 matching of the semiclassical wavefunctions throughout the network determines the energy spectrum . 
 semiclassical orbits with energies well below that of the saddle points are landau levels of the dirac points in each layer . 
 these continuously evolve into _ both _ electron - like and hole - like levels above the saddle point energy . 
 possible experimental signatures are discussed .    
 _ introduction _  the fundamental description of electron dynamics in a crystal and a uniform magnetic field involves orbital motion in a plane perpendicular to the field , along contours of constant energy @xcite as a function of crystal momentum * k*. this behavior can be significantly modified when tunneling from one trajectory to another becomes important , a phenomenon known as magnetic breakdown ( mb ) @xcite . 
 mb is important when the closest approach between @xmath0-space trajectories is on the order of the inverse of magnetic length , @xmath2}$ ] nm , where @xmath3 is the magnetic field in tesla . 
 mb sometimes leads to the formation of open orbits , with dramatic transport signatures @xcite .    
 mb effects in bulk metals can be challenging to observe because saddle points in a band structure , where mb initially sets in as the electron energy changes @xcite , are often quite far from the fermi energy . 
 recently , excellent candidates to observe mb phenomena have become available in the form of twisted graphene bilayers @xcite and graphene deposited on boron nitride substrates @xcite . 
 these two - dimensional systems can support large unit cells in real space ( `` moir patterns '' ) , and correspondingly small brillouin zones , for which critical points in the energy dispersion can be at relatively low energy @xcite . 
 such large unit cells have allowed the recent observation of the self - similar hofstadter spectrum @xcite , and may in principle nucleate unusual many - body states @xcite for fermi energies near that of a saddle point . 
 these interesting behaviors are among the reasons that twisted bilayers have attracted so much attention @xcite .    a twisted bilayer graphene system is characterized by a rotation angle @xmath4 of the layers principal axes relative to an aa - stacked bilayer . in momentum space 
 , this relative rotation separates the dirac points associated with each layer by a distance @xmath5 . at low magnetic field and for energies just above those of the dirac points , momentum space trajectories are circular and surround one or the other dirac point . 
 allowed areas enclosed by these trajectories are quantized in units of @xmath6 , are electron - like ( increase in energy with field ) , and yield a spectrum essentially the same as for uncoupled layers . at higher energy 
 these trajectories approach one another , and interlayer tunneling becomes qualitatively important . 
 to understand how the spectrum evolves it is crucial to recognize that the coupling results in _ three _ distinguishable , degenerate saddle points . in the presence of the field , as the energy is raised above that of the saddle points the semiclassical orbits break apart and reconnect . 
 the new orbits are topologically distinct from the lower energy ones in that they enclose _ neither _ of the dirac points . 
 instead they surround a local maximum and navely should be hole - like , _ i.e. _ decrease in energy with field @xcite . 
 this suggests a very large accumulation of levels at the saddle point energy at high field . 
 below we demonstrate by a careful treatment of the magnetic translational symmetries that such singular behavior is avoided . 
 the spectrum necessarily contains _ both _ hole - like and electron - like orbits above the saddle point ( see fig . 
 2 ) , with the latter sweeping the levels to high energy at large field . 
 we expect this mechanism to be generic to band structures in which there is a sharp transition energy between hole - like and electron - like semiclassical orbits .    the model we adopt for the system , first introduced in ref . , contains one dirac hamiltonian for each layer and three interlayer hopping terms , two of which contain scattering momenta @xmath7 and @xmath8 . 
 these become reciprocal lattice vectors for the system ( see fig .  [ 2bz ] ) , and define the brillouin zone ( bz ) for the zero field energy spectrum . in the presence of a magnetic field 
 , energy eigenstates can simultaneously be eigenstates of two magnetic translation operators , but , as we show below , the resulting states can be represented as @xmath0-space trajectories only if one includes a minimum of two bz s in the representation . 
 this turns out to be a crucial element in understanding the energy spectrum above the saddle point : one finds two `` star - like '' semiclassical orbits , illustrated in fig .  
 [ 2bz ] . 
 a very unusual property of these orbits is that they involve periodic oscillations of the electrons between layers , and their quantization conditions leads to the interpenetrating electron- and hole - like levels . 
 we discuss possible experimental consequences of these properties below .    
 _ hamiltonian and saddle point dispersions _  our starting point is the zero - field hamiltonian @xcite    h= (    cccc h_t & w_i=0,1,2v_i + w_i=0,1,2v_i^ & h_b    ) , [ basicmodel ] in which @xmath9 $ ] are the dirac hamiltonians for uncoupled top / bottom layers , with dirac points located at @xmath10 , @xmath11 are components of the momentum operator , and the pauli matrices @xmath12 act on the sublattice index . 
 the coupling terms , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , are the largest interlayer hopping terms expected in a continuum model @xcite . 
 these introduce discrete translational symmetry characterized by reciprocal lattice vectors @xmath16 . 
 the hopping matrices are then specified by @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 . here 
 @xmath20 is the two - dimensional unit matrix , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is its complex conjugate .    to understand the behavior of this system , we treat the interlayer hopping as a weak periodic perturbation . 
 this has important qualitative effects for nearly degenerate states in the top and bottom layers that are coupled by the perturbation . 
 for example ( see fig .  
 [ 2bz ] ) , a degeneracy between the top and bottom dirac bands in the neighborhood of @xmath23 is split by the interlayer term @xmath24 . setting @xmath25 to unity , we find that the two states at @xmath26 with energy @xmath27 in the absence of @xmath24 splits into states of energies @xmath28 . near @xmath23 , 
 one may treat terms involving ( small ) momenta @xmath29 perturbatively , to obtain a two - band effective hamiltonian @xcite h_sp=(k_/2+k_1 ^ 2/k_)_2 + , [ 2band ] where @xmath30 is small . 
 the eigenstates of @xmath31 include a parabolic band at higher energy , and a lower band with a saddle point ( sp ) for which the dispersion is @xmath32 , leading to a van hove singularity at @xmath33 . 
 this is similar to numerical results found in ref .  .    
 there are two other saddle points in the first bz , near @xmath34 and @xmath35 in fig . 
 [ 2bz ] . 
 dispersions for these can be obtained in a way very similar to that of @xmath23 by employing an appropriate unitary transformation , shifting the zero of momentum for one of the two layers by @xmath7 or @xmath8 . 
 up to 120@xmath36 rotations , the resulting spectra are essentially identical to that of @xmath23 .    , @xmath34 , @xmath35 . 
 symbols of cross represent the dirac points . 
 , scaledwidth=40.0% ]    _ magnetic translation ( mt ) operators _  to incorporate a uniform perpendicular magnetic field we introduce a vector potential @xmath37 . to study the small @xmath38 limit it is convenient to work with momentum - space wavefunctions , so that the momentum operators @xmath39 entering eq .  
 [ basicmodel ] are replaced by @xmath40 . in the momentum representation , the interlayer tunneling terms are @xmath41 where @xmath42 , with momentum translation operators @xmath43    to exploit the translational symmetries of the problem we define mt operators t_1(g_x)= , + t_2(g_y)=,[mmt ] which commute with @xmath44 . 
 the combinations @xmath45 moreover commute with the _ full _ hamiltonian , as well as with one another , if 4 ^ 2_bg_xg_y=2n , [ fluxcondition ] for any integer @xmath46 . 
 we focus on magnetic fields satisfying this equality . 
 note such fields have the form @xmath47 , so that our analysis applies to a dense set of small magnetic fields . 
 eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian can also be expressed as eigenfunctions of mt operators that commute with @xmath48 , and it is convenient to choose the particular combination @xmath49 and @xmath50 for this purpose . to see how this plays out , we consider spinor wavefunctions written in the form @xmath51 . in the absence of interlayer coupling 
 , @xmath52 is a good quantum number and eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian involve harmonic oscillator states whose centers lie near @xmath52 . 
 thus @xmath52 can be viewed as a momentum - space guiding center coordinate . 
 more generally , the requirement that wavefunctions be eigenvectors of @xmath53 dictates that @xmath54 be the same for all the @xmath55 s entering a wavefunction . 
 the integral over @xmath52 then becomes a discrete sum . to see 
 the effect of interlayer coupling one needs to notice that the action of momentum shift operator @xmath56 appearing in the interlayer coupling on @xmath57 becomes @xmath58 this is consistent with the allowed discrete values of @xmath52 for a given wavefunction provided eq .  
 [ fluxcondition ] is obeyed .    
 thus @xmath59 can be written as a sum over wavefunctions @xmath60 with @xmath61 and @xmath62 . 
 the set of @xmath52 s one must retain is further reduced by use of a second mt symmetry condition , @xmath63 this becomes the condition @xmath64 . 
 ultimately one needs to only compute _ two _ functions , e.g. , @xmath65 and @xmath66 .    
 some comments are in order . 
 first , the reduction of the wavefunction to two functions of @xmath67 was possible because of our gauge choice @xcite . 
 secondly , since @xmath68 involves a single continuous variable , @xmath67 , it can be approximated conveniently in a semiclassical approach . because we need to retain two values of @xmath52 
 , these wavefunctions must be represented in two bz s @xcite . 
 finally , while the two - bz semiclassical description is strictly valid only for fields satisfying eq.[fluxcondition ] , we will treat @xmath38 as a continuous variable . 
 this captures the broad shape of the spectrum , but misses small gaps in what turn out to be narrow bands in the low field limit @xcite .    
 _ semiclassical wavefunctions _  
 assuming @xmath69 is larger than any other length scale in the problem ( weak fields ) , we may use a gradient expansion for the wavefunctions @xcite , @xmath70 $ ] . 
 we again start with uncoupled layers . defining @xmath71 , with @xmath72 , and @xmath73 , @xmath74 for the top ( bottom ) layer , 
 the lowest non - trivial contribution has the form _~ e^i_b^2^k_1dk_x q_y^(k_x ) . 
 [ semiclassical ] the ( spinor ) coefficient of the wavefunction is determined at higher order in @xmath6 @xcite , and is not included in our analysis . 
 the set of momenta @xmath75 represent contours of constant energy above and below a dirac point . 
 when @xmath76 approaches 0 , these two curves approach one another , and the semiclassical approximation breaks down . to account for this one employs matching conditions @xcite at each turning point . 
 these work simultaneously at certain discrete energies , yielding a spectrum with spacing matching the exact result for landau levels of a single dirac point hamiltonian .    
 this result is essentially correct even in the presence of interlayer tunneling when one considers levels close in energy to that of the dirac points . for energies near those of the saddle points 
 , one must develop further connection formulae among the different semiclassical trajectories @xcite . 
 this is most easily implemented for @xmath77 , which connects trajectories near @xmath23 in fig .  
 [ 2bz ] . 
 the cases of @xmath78 are somewhat more complicated @xcite . 
 @xmath79 connects the wavefunction for @xmath52 in the top layer with with the bottom layer for @xmath80 through the saddle point @xmath35 via the operator @xmath81 . 
 the problem becomes closely analogous to that of the @xmath23 saddle point if one applies a unitary transformation , shifting the bottom component of the wavefunctions by @xmath82 . 
 this is represented conveniently by placing one quarter of the bz for @xmath80 continuously onto the upper right side of the @xmath52 bz . 
 similar constructions for @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 bring in another quarter of the @xmath80 bz on the lower right , and half of the @xmath86 bz on the left , yielding a doubled bz in the form of a rectangle . 
 this is illustrated in fig .  
 [ 2bz ] along with relevant semiclassical orbits , which are labeled with unprimed ( primed ) numbers for the @xmath52 ( @xmath87 ) bz .    wavefunctions for the full system involve amplitudes multiplying functions of the form in eq .  
 [ semiclassical ] , with the caveat that @xmath88 represents the location of the dirac point around which an orbit is centered . 
 we assign an amplitude for each trajectory that enters or exits a saddle point , which are related to one another in several ways . 
 ( _ i _ ) each trajectory has an amplitude @xmath89 to exit from some saddle point and an amplitude @xmath90 to enter another . 
 these are related by @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the area between the trajectory ( which begins and ends at the points of closest approach to the saddle points ) and the @xmath93 axis in fig .  
 [ 2bz ] . 
 this area is taken to be positive ( negative ) if the trajectory is above @xmath67-axis and moves to the right ( left ) . 
 factors of @xmath94 must be inserted if there is a left or right turning point in the trajectory @xcite . _ 
 ( ii ) _ at each saddle point shown in fig .  
 [ 2bz ] , there are two incoming trajectories and two outgoing ones . 
 these are related by an @xmath1-matrix , which we discuss in more detail below . _ 
 ( iii ) _ trajectories exiting the doubled bz on the left or right are related to ones entering on the opposite side due to the periodicity imposed by the mt operators . 
 the effect of this can be incorporated in the matrices relating different amplitudes with some added ( energy independent ) phase factors @xcite . in practice , their presence only impacts the spectrum for energies rather close to that of the saddle points .    
 the @xmath1-matrix associated with the saddle points can be obtained through the two - band model , eq .  
 ( [ 2band ] ) . introducing the magnetic field by adding a vector potential to the momentum @xmath95 , one finds the eigenvalue equation can be reduced to a single component problem in the neighborhood of the saddle point at @xmath96 . with a gauge transformation to landau gauge , 
 one obtains an eigenvalue equation involving a massive particle in an inverted parabolic potential , @xmath97\psi=0 $ ] with @xmath98 and @xmath99^{\frac{1}{4}}$ ] @xcite . here 
 we define @xmath100 . 
 the resultant @xmath1-matrix is then obtained by standard methods @xcite , yielding s_0= (    cccc 1 & ie^-/2 + ie^-/2 & 1    ) , [ smatrix ] with @xmath101 . 
 eq .  
 ( [ smatrix ] ) suggests that @xmath102 for @xmath103 and @xmath104 for @xmath105 . 
 these two limits define intra- and inter - layer dominant scattering regimes , respectively . 
 as written , @xmath106 applies directly to @xmath23 ; for @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 , certain matrix elements are multiplied by phase factors related to the eigenvalues of @xmath110 and @xmath111 @xcite . 
 these only have noticeable affect quite close to the saddle point energy .    the description above yields 24 independent amplitudes and 24 equations relating them . 
 it is convenient to group these amplitudes into the six four - component columns , @xmath112 , @xmath113 , and @xmath114 . 
 the labels for portions of the trajectories are displayed in fig .  
 [ 2bz ] . requiring single - valued wavefunctions then leads to the condition @xcite det=0.[final_expression ] in this representation , the @xmath115 s are 4 @xmath116 4 matrices which treat scattering through the @xmath117 and @xmath118 sp s together ( @xmath119 ) . 
 the unitary matrix @xmath120 $ ] with @xmath121 encodes areas swept out by electron orbits between the @xmath122th and @xmath123th sp . 
 precise definitions of the @xmath115 s , @xmath124 s , and @xmath125 s are given in ref .  .    . 
 here the reference of energy corresponds to zero of @xmath126 . 
 energy units are @xmath127 , magnetic field units are @xmath128 . , scaledwidth=50.0% ]    numerical solutions to the problem described above are illustrated in fig .  
 [ ll ] . and are consistent with direct numerical diagonalization @xcite of the hamiltonian in eq . 
 [ basicmodel ] @xcite . 
 relatively simple behavior is apparent well below and above the saddle point energy , which may be understood analytically . below the saddle point , 
 interlayer tunneling is negligible , leading to @xmath129 . 
 moreover , @xmath130 , which is the area enclosed by a trajectory in an uncoupled layer , and @xmath131 . 
 this leads to the standard dirac - landau level spacing .    above the saddle point 
 , one finds @xcite @xmath132 and @xmath133 . 
 these anticommute with @xmath134 , and one can show that eq . 
 [ final_expression ] is satisfied if @xmath135 for either one of the two signs in the exponent . in this expression , 
 @xmath136 , and @xmath137 corresponds to the area of half of a single bz . 
 the quantities @xmath138 are areas related to the star - like orbits , which increase ( decrease ) in magnitude with energy , leading to coexisting electron- and hole - like levels .    
 _ discussion _  the spectrum predicted above resolves some apparent inconsistencies among recent results . 
 studies which include only one saddle point @xcite yield purely electron - like spectra . 
 by contrast , one expects hole - like orbits surrounding local maxima to come down towards the saddle point , as shown in tight - binding studies of the twisted bilayer @xcite . 
 these pictures are in a sense both correct . 
 when several sp s are degenerate in energy , the necessity to include multiple bz s allows electron- and hole - like orbits to coexist . 
 importantly , this structure explains how levels rising from below the sp and levels falling from above with increasing @xmath38 evolve : the levels anti - cross , and all ultimately move to high energy when the field is sufficiently large , as is evident in fig .

 this behavior should appear in many systems where degenerate , distinguishable sp s allow a transition between topologically distinct semiclassical orbits , including graphene on boron nitride substrates @xcite , and in single layer graphene at high energy @xcite . 
 this behavior is also apparent in the surface states of crystalline topological insulators in a magnetic field @xcite .    the peculiar landau level structure and the associated semiclassical orbits in our model should have a number of experimental ramifications . for sufficiently clean samples , the level structure itself could be detected directly in tunneling @xcite . 
 cyclotron resonance @xcite brings another interesting perspective : since star - like orbits tunnel periodically between layers , electromagnetic waves with electric field perpendicular to the layers should couple to them and allow absorption , whereas in truly two - dimensional systems this would not be possible . 
 ( preliminary calculations @xcite demonstrate that this is indeed the case . ) 
 thermodynamically , converging hole - like and electron - like orbits at the saddle point energy should lead to cusp - like behavior in magnetic susceptibility @xcite . 
 finally , breaking the symmetry among the saddle points , for example by strain or a periodic potential @xcite , can in principle induce open orbits , which might be observed in transport as a metal - insulator transition .

"nuclear modifications of hadron production in high - energy collisions have been observed in both deep inelastic lepton - nucleus scattering ( ndis ) @xcite and in heavy ion collisions @xcite .
one typically observes : ( i ) a suppression of hadron multiplicities , called hadron quenching or jet quenching ; ( ii ) hadron transverse momentum ( @xmath0 ) broadening ; ( iii ) the related modification of the hadron @xmath0-spectrum also known as cronin effect .
the nuclear modifications can be attributed to the interactions of the scattered partons and of the hadrons formed in their fragmentation with the surrounding medium .
experimentally , partonic in - medium interactions can be isolated by studying drell - yan ( dy ) lepton pair production in hadron - nucleus collisions . in ndis and hadron - nucleus collisions ,
the medium is the nuclear target itself , also called `` cold nuclear matter '' . in nucleus - nucleus collisions
, the fragmenting parton must also traverse the hot and dense medium created in the collisions , be it a hadron gas at low energy , or a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) at high energy .
this medium is also called `` hot nuclear matter '' .
a precise knowledge of parton propagation and hadronization mechanisms obtained from ndis and dy data is essential for testing and calibrating our theoretical tools , and to determine the properties of the qgp produced at the relativistic heavy ion collider .
conversely , a well known nuclear medium like a target nucleus allows testing the hadronization mechanism and color confinement dynamics in ndis .
knowledge of partonic in - medium propagation gained from ndis , can be used in dy scatterings to factor out parton energy loss and measure the nuclear modifications of parton distributions in the initial state @xcite .
finally , hadron quenching is an important source of systematic uncertainty in neutrino oscillation experiments such as minos , which use nuclear targets and need to reconstruct the event s kinematic from the hadronic final state @xcite
.     created at time 0 in a hard collision turns into a colored prehadron @xmath1 , which subsequently neutralizes its color , @xmath2 , and collapses on the wave function of the observed hadron @xmath3 . ]
understanding and modeling nuclear modifications of hadron production requires knowledge of the space - time evolution of the hadronization process @xcite .
however , hadronization is a non perturbative process , and its theoretical understanding is still in its infancy : one has to resort to phenomenological models to describe its space - time evolution @xcite .
nonetheless , a few features can be expected on general grounds .
a parton created in a high - energy collision can travel as a free particle only for a limited time because of color confinement : it has to dress - up in a color - field of loosely bound partons , which eventually will evolve into the observed hadron wave function . while the naked , asymptotically free , parton has a negligible inelastic cross section with the surrounding medium constituents , the dressed parton is likely to develop an inelastic cross section of the order of the hadronic one .
hence , the dressed parton will be subject to nuclear absorption in a similar way a fully formed hadron is .
for this reason , it is usually called `` prehadron '' , and denoted by @xmath4 .
the prehadron may for some time be in a colored state , @xmath1 , because color neutrality is only required for the final state hadron .
however , it is likely to neutralize its color before hadron formation , and the colorless prehadron is denoted @xmath2 .
we can therefore identify 3 relevant time scales , see fig .
[ fig : hadrosketch ] : ( 1 ) the `` prehadron production time '' or `` quark lifetime '' @xmath5 , at which the dressed quark develops a sizable inelastic cross section , ( 2 ) the `` color neutralization time '' @xmath6 , at which gluon bremsstrahlung stops , and ( 3 ) the `` hadron formation time '' @xmath7 , at which the final hadron is formed .    for practical applications
, hadronization is generally pictured as a 2 step process in which the prehadron production time and color neutralization time are identified , @xmath8 .
this is a somewhat crude approximation of the more complex process sketched above , but is adequate to the present status of the theoretical and experimental investigation and will be used in this paper .    in summary ,
the key quantity we need to investigate in order to understand this complex dynamics is the hadronization time scale , @xmath5 .
it is the most general information about the space - time evolution of the hadronization process which can be extracted from experimental data .
it is the purpose of this paper to provide a semi - quantitative and model independent estimate of the prehadron production time from recent preliminary data on the @xmath0-broadening taken by the hermes  experiment in lepton - nucleus scatterings at the hera accelerator @xcite .
these data show rich features in terms of their dependence on the kinematic variables , which are confirmed by preliminary data taken by the clas  experiment at jefferson lab @xcite , and are not always simple to interpret theoretically .
i will show to what extent a consistent picture of the space - time evolution of hadronization can be inferred from these data , and how they are beginning to expose the limits of current theoretical modeling of this process .
hadron quenching in ndis is studied in terms of the multiplicity ratio @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the yield of semi - inclusive hadrons in a given kinematic bin , and @xmath11 the yield of inclusive scattered leptons in the same ( @xmath12,@xmath13)-bin . the kinematic variables @xmath14 , @xmath12 , @xmath15 , @xmath13 are the usual dis invariants , namely , the hadron fractional energy , the virtual photon energy , the hadron transverse momentum and the lepton 4-momentum transfer squared .    in ref .
@xcite it is conjectured that @xmath16 should not depend on @xmath14 and @xmath12 separately but should depend on a combination of them : @xmath17 \ ,   \label{eq : rmscaling}\end{aligned}\ ] ] where the scaling variable @xmath18 is defined as @xmath19 the scaling exponent @xmath20 can be obtained by a best fit analysis of data or theoretical computations .
obviously , the proportionality constant @xmath21 can not be determined by the fit . a possible
scaling of @xmath16 with @xmath13 is not considered because of its model dependence , and because of the mild dependence of hermes @xmath16 data on @xmath13 . as discussed below , the proposed functional form of @xmath18 , eq .  ,
is flexible enough to encompass both absorption models , which assume short production times and in - medium hadronization , and energy loss models , which assume long lived quarks with @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the nuclear radius .
the 2 classes of models are distinguished by the value of the scaling exponent : a positive @xmath24 is characteristic of absorption models , while a negative @xmath25 is characteristic of energy loss models .
thus , the exponent @xmath20 extracted from experimental data can identify the leading mechanism for hadron suppression in ndis , and distinguish short from long hadronization time scales .
the scaling of @xmath16 is quite natural in the context of hadron absorption models @xcite .
indeed , prehadron absorption depends on the in - medium prehadron path length , which depends on the prehadron production time @xmath26 , as long as @xmath27 . in the lund string model
@xcite hadronization is modeled by the breaking of the color string stretching from the struck parton to the target remnant .
the production time is @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the struck quark energy , and @xmath30 the string tension . at leading order ( lo ) in the strong coupling constant @xmath31 ,
the partonic subprocess is @xmath32 and one obtains @xmath33 the factor @xmath34 can be understood as a lorentz boost factor .
the @xmath35 factor is due to energy conservation : a high-@xmath14 hadron carries away an energy @xmath36 ; the string remainder has a small energy @xmath37 and can not stretch farther than @xmath38 .
thus the string breaking must occur on a time scale proportional to @xmath39 .
the function @xmath40 is a small deformation of @xmath26 , which can be computed analytically in the standard lund model @xcite .
the main features of the estimate are dictated by kinematics and 4-momentum conservation , hence are of general nature .
indeed they can be obtained also by perturbative considerations based on the uncertainty principle , similarly to what is discussed in ref .
@xcite , or in the perturbative hadronization model of ref .
the production time is well described by the proposed scaling variable @xmath18 with @xmath41 .
e.g. , in the lund model @xmath42 @xcite . in energy loss models @xcite , which assume @xmath22 , the scaling is less obvious and holds only approximately on a theoretical ground .
when performing the scaling analysis of the full energy loss models , one finds in general @xmath43 @xcite .
the central result of the analysis of hermes data at @xmath44 gev performed in ref .
@xcite is that pion data clearly exhibit @xmath45 as discussed , this is a signal of in - medium prehadron formation , with production times @xmath46 .
therefore , the scaling variable @xmath18 can be identified with the average production time : @xmath47 the proportionality constant @xmath21 in eq .
, hence the magnitude of the production time , will be estimated in section  [ sec : discussion - ptbroad ] .
a similar analysis has been attempted in ref .
@xcite , but arbitrarily fixing @xmath48 .
the resulting @xmath49 shows a rough scaling , with the 2 lowest-@xmath14 data point in each data set deviating from the scaling curve and aligning in the vertical direction .
this breaking of the scaling behavior is more probably due to the particular choice of @xmath20 , rather than to rescattering effects as argued by the authors .
the scaling analysis just described gives only indirect evidence for a short production time @xmath26 , and can not measure its absolute scale .
an observable which is more directly related to the prehadron production time , and allows an estimate of the coefficient @xmath21 in eq .  , is the hadron s transverse momentum broadening in dis on a nuclear target compared to a proton or deuteron target @xcite , @xmath50 when a hadron is observed in the final state , neither the quark nor the prehadron from which it originates could have had inelastic scatterings .
since the prehadron - nucleon elastic cross section is very small compared to the quark cross section , the hadron s @xmath0-broadening originates dominantly during parton propagation .
as shown in @xcite , the quark s momentum broadening @xmath51 is proportional to the quark path - length in the nucleus .
if the prehadron production time has the form as argued in the last section , and as long as the prehadron is formed inside the nucleus , we obtain @xmath52 where the exponent 0.5 is determined by the scaling analysis discussed in section [ sec : scaling ] .
then , a decrease of @xmath53 with increasing @xmath14 or decreasing @xmath12 would be a clear signal of in - medium prehadron formation : indeed , if the quark were traveling through the whole nucleus before prehadron formation , @xmath53 would only depend on the nucleus size and not on @xmath14 or @xmath12 .
in addition to the dependence of @xmath51 on @xmath14 and @xmath12 , which primarily stems from energy conservation and the lorentz boost of the hadron , ref .
@xcite argues that @xmath54 the physics behind this proposed behavior is that a quark which is struck by a photon of large virtuality radiates more intensely than for a lower virtuality : as a consequence , it will be able to only travel a shorter way before hadronization , hence it will experience less @xmath0-broadening .
a related observable is the cronin effect , which is likewise expected to decrease with increasing @xmath14 or decreasing @xmath12 , and possibly with increasing @xmath13 @xcite .

, title='fig : ' ]    the hermes preliminary data on the @xmath0-broadening , reproduced in figs .
[ fig : hermesptbroad_a ] and [ fig : hermesptbroad_znuq2 ] for the reader s convenience , show a linear increase with @xmath57 , and a clear decrease of @xmath51 at large @xmath14 consistent with eq .   and
hermes data on the cronin effect @xcite .
however , hermes data also show a clearly increasing @xmath58 with @xmath59 gev@xmath56 , at variance with the @xmath13 dependence of the prehadron production time obtained in ref .
@xcite , and with string models in general .
they also show an increase of @xmath60 with @xmath61 tending to saturate at @xmath62 @xcite .
the flat , or even slightly decreasing dependence of @xmath51 on @xmath12 is also , at first sight , not easily interpreted in the context of eq .   and the simple hadronization picture used so far .
.average hermes kinematics for the @xmath0-broadening results @xcite . in parenthesis , beside the target nucleus symbol is the average in - medium path length of the hadronizing system @xmath63 , with @xmath64 .
the production time is computed according to eq .  .
the average @xmath65 is very well approximated by @xmath66 @xcite . [ cols='^,^,^,^,^,^ ' , ]     it is also important to extend as much as possible the range in @xmath61 over which the @xmath0-broadening is measured : at small @xmath67 the nlo photon - gluon fusion is the dominant partonic process , while at @xmath68 the photon dominantly scatters at lo valence quarks .
hence , with mechanism number 2 , one may expect @xmath51 to flat in @xmath13 in these 2 regions .
a last question needs to be addressed : how do the hermes data and these scenarios compare to preliminary clas data @xcite on the @xmath0-broadening and cronin effect ?    at clas , the higher beam luminosity allows multidimensional binning which is only partly accessible at hermes .
the kinematics is a bit different due to the lower beam energy , @xmath69 gev compared to 27 gev .
the main difference is that @xmath70 gev is much smaller than at hermes , therefore prehadron production should typically happen on shorter time scales , mainly inside the nucleus according to the estimate
. note also that @xmath71 gev@xmath56 , and that , typically , @xmath72 .
the main features of clas data on c , fe , and pb targets are the following :    * the @xmath0-broadening is linear in @xmath57 at low @xmath73 , but tends to saturate for large nuclei . the flattening is confirmed by the lack of increase in the cronin effect from the fe target to the pb target .
this shows the prehadron being formed on a time scale @xmath74 fm , smaller than at hermes .
* the @xmath0-broadening is rising and then saturating with @xmath12 .
the saturation appears at @xmath75 gev , where the hermes @xmath0 is also approximately flat . *
the cronin effect decreases with @xmath14 as it happens at hermes .
* the cronin effect markedly increases as @xmath61 increases from 0.1 to 0.5 .
this confirms the @xmath61 dependence of hermes  @xmath0-broadening .
all these features corroborate the discussed hermes data . however , the production time i have estimated is about a factor 5 smaller than the production time extracted in ref .
@xcite from clas @xmath12-distributions using the color dipole formalism @xcite . on the other hand , based on this paper s analysis , and taking into account the uncertainty in the estimate of @xmath76 , hermes data can only support up to a doubling of @xmath5 , which would otherwise become incompatible with the large-@xmath14 decrease of the @xmath0-broadening .
the hermes  and clas  data sets may be qualitatively reconciled by taking into account the observed increase of the @xmath0-broadening with @xmath65 discussed in the previous section .
indeed , @xmath77 , which implies a larger @xmath0-broadening at clas .    the origin of the discrepancy between the production times extracted from hermes and clas data on the @xmath0-broadening remains to be clarified . on the theoretical side ,
the two discussed methods to determine the production time should be applied to both data sets , in order to check their consistency and further explore the issue . on the experimental side
, it is very important to establish and study the correlation of @xmath51 with @xmath61 and @xmath13 , as emphasized in the previous section .
in this paper , i attempted a semi - quantitative estimate of the prehadron production time , based on recent preliminary hermes  data on hadron @xmath0-broadening in nuclear dis , see eq .  .
the obtained production time can well explain the dependence of the @xmath0-broadening on @xmath73 , @xmath14 and @xmath12 .
its linear increase with @xmath13 remains a challenge to current theoretical models , and i proposed a few mechanisms that may contribute to its explanation , also suggesting how to experimentally validate them .
furthermore , i discussed how the preliminary clas  data qualitatively support the features observed at hermes .    with the obtained estimate of @xmath5 ,
the prehadrons at hermes   are typically formed around the nuclear surface or slightly outside , while at clas  they are typically formed inside the target . however , a quantitative analysis indicate that @xmath78 .
the observed @xmath61 dependence of the @xmath0-broadening can at least in part reconcile the 2 data sets , as well as explain the @xmath13 dependence of the data .
it also points at a non - negligible role of nlo processes in the hadronization process .
the measurement of hadron @xmath0-broadening , and the related cronin effect , are beginning to test the limits of current theory models on the space - time evolution of hadronization , which are based on lo @xmath79-quark scattering , followed by color neutralization of the quark and hadron formation .
the main theoretical challenges raised by these data are , in my opinion ,    * the inclusion of nlo processes in the modeling of hadron quenching . * the implementation at lo , and subsequently at nlo , of alternative models of energy loss , like a medium - modified dglap evolution ; * testing of alternative space - time pictures beyond the 2 time scale models currently accepted ; for example , the role of a colored prehadron should be explored .      *
the role of parton energy loss can be highlighted by large-@xmath12/small-@xmath14 cuts , such that the parton lifetime exceeds the nuclear size ; * in - medium hadronization can be selected by small-@xmath12/large-@xmath14 cuts ; * the @xmath61 dependence of @xmath51 , the cronin effect , and the multiplicity ratio needs to be better studied over a large interval of @xmath61 , including small @xmath80 and large @xmath81 ; additionally , dihadron correlations and the hadron multiplicity per event as a function of @xmath61 can more directly reveal the role of nlo processes , in which 2 partons can be produced at the hard scattering ; * the combined analysis of @xmath0-broadening s @xmath61-distributions binned in @xmath13 and of @xmath13-distributions binned in @xmath61 is likely to usefully expose the underlying dynamics .    because of the available @xmath12 range , the hermes  experiment and the future electron - ion collider are best suited to study the role of parton energy loss and propagation in cold nuclear matter . at clas ,
in - medium hadronization is likely to be dominant and can be studied in detail thanks to its high - statistics data , which allow multidimensional binning and the study of one kinematic variable at a time .

a.  accardi , talk at the _
workshop on `` electromagnetic interactions on nucleons and nuclei '' _ , santorini ( greece ) , october 2003 ." ," a semi - quantitative estimate of the prehadron production time based on recent preliminary hermes  data on hadron transverse momentum broadening in nuclear dis is presented . 
 the obtained production time can well explain the data except for their dependence on the photon virtuality , which remains a challenge to current theoretical models 
 . a few mechanisms that may contribute to its explanation are suggested , along with possible experimental tests . the average time scale at hermes  is found to be of the order of 4 - 5 fm , comparable to heavy nuclei radii , so that by suitable kinematic cuts it will be possible to study both the case in which hadronization starts inside and the case in which it starts outside the nucleus . 
 a comparison with recent clas preliminary data , which qualitatively but not quantitatively agree with hermes , is performed . "
"the super - kamiokande ( sk ) experiment @xcite is measuring the rate @xmath5 of electrons produced by @xmath4b solar neutrinos @xcite through the scattering process @xmath6 in a fiducial mass of 22.5 kton of water and above a threshold @xmath7 for the measured electron kinetic energy @xcite .
there are good prospects for lowering @xmath8 to @xmath9 mev in the near future @xcite .    in the presence of flavor oscillations ,
as suggested by various solutions to the solar neutrino problem @xcite , also muon and tau neutrinos can contribute to @xmath5 through neutral current interactions @xmath10 although it is not possible to separate the contribution of reaction  ( [ numutau ] ) from reaction  ( [ nue ] ) within the sk experiment itself .    in this work
we show how to separate in a model independent way the @xmath1 and @xmath2 event rates in the sk experiment , by means of the sudbury neutrino observatory ( sno ) @xcite measurement of the total electron rate ( @xmath11 ) from the charged current process @xmath12 provided that the corresponding electron energy threshold @xmath13 is chosen appropriately .
no other experimental information or theoretical assumption is required .
more precisely , we show that the response functions of the sk and sno detectors happen to be approximately equal for suitably chosen values of @xmath8 and @xmath13 , within errors much smaller than the uncertainties associated to the cross section for reaction  ( [ nud ] ) .
this lucky circumstance makes our approach truly model independent : no prior assumption is required on the absolute @xmath4b neutrino flux @xmath14 , on the energy ( in)dependence of the oscillation probability , or on the presence of possible sterile neutrinos .
furthermore , if only active neutrinos are considered , the absolute value of @xmath14 can also be determined from the same data ( @xmath5 and @xmath11 ) .
the plan of the paper is as follows . in section
ii we set the notation . in section
iii we study the response functions of sk and sno and show that they can be equalized to a good approximation by tuning the energy thresholds . in section
iv we work out the consequences of this empirical equality .
we draw our conclusions in sec .
v.    we conclude this section by estimating the rate of solar - neutrino induced electrons @xmath5 actually occurring in the sk detector .
the rate of _ observed _ events above @xmath15 mev is @xmath16 events / kton / day @xcite .
however , this number is expected to be smaller than the actual rate of @xmath17 interactions , due to inefficiencies in the data reduction chain .
the total signal efficiency @xmath18 appears to be dominated by three cuts : ( 1 ) noise cut , @xmath19 @xcite ; ( 2 ) spallation cut , @xmath20 @xcite ; and gamma ray cut , @xmath21 @xcite .
then we get @xmath22 , in agreement with the signal efficiency quoted in @xcite .
therefore , we estimate the total number of @xmath17 interactions ( detected and undetected ) occurring in sk as : @xmath23 analogously , and by cutting the electron energy spectrum @xcite at @xmath24 mev , we obtain @xmath25 our estimates ( [ r1],[r2 ] ) are tentative and will be used only for some numerical examples , the main idea of this work being independent on the specific value of @xmath5 .
it is understood that , when the sno data will become available and will be compared with the sk data , one should use both rates @xmath5 and @xmath11 as corrected for efficiency effects by the experimental collaborations themselves .
we denote the absolute flux of @xmath4b solar neutrinos by @xmath14 and its energy spectrum @xcite by @xmath26 , @xmath27 @xmath28 being the neutrino energy .
we do not assume any prior estimate of @xmath14 from standard solar models @xcite in this work .    in the presence of neutrino oscillations ,
we denote the @xmath1 oscillation probabilities into other states ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 , or sterile @xmath31 ) as @xmath32 subject to the unitarity constraint @xmath33 .
no assumption is made on the functional form of @xmath34 .
the neutrino cross sections for the reactions ( [ nue ] ) , ( [ numutau ] ) , and ( [ nud ] ) are indicated as @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 , respectively .
it is understood that each cross section @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) is corrected for the energy threshold and resolution effects appropriate to the the sk and sno detectors , @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the _ true _ and _ measured _ electron kinetic energies , respectively , @xmath43 is the energy threshold ( equal to @xmath8 for @xmath35 and @xmath36 and to @xmath13 for @xmath37 ) , and @xmath13 are _ data analysis _ thresholds that can be chosen freely , provided that they are greater than the _ detector trigger _ thresholds . ]
@xmath44 is the differential cross section , and @xmath45 is the energy resolution function @xmath46 with a one - sigma width @xmath47 scaling as @xmath48 @xmath49 being equal to 1.5 mev for sk @xcite and to 1.4 mev for sno @xcite .
the differential cross sections are taken from @xcite for reactions  ( [ nue],[numutau ] ) and from @xcite for reaction  ( [ nud ] ) .    in the calculation of event rates , the cross sections @xmath38
always appear in the combination @xmath50 .
it is then useful to define two quantities ( related to @xmath50 ) that characterize completely the detector response to a given neutrino reaction , namely , the energy averaged cross section @xmath51 , @xmath52 and the normalized response function @xmath53 , @xmath54 @xmath55 .
we remark that both functions @xmath56 and @xmath57 do not depend on the value of @xmath14 nor on @xmath34 ; they are completely determined from detector properties , cross sections and @xmath4b decay spectrum .    given the above definitions , the rate of electrons produced per unit time and target electron in super - kamiokande through reactions ( [ nue ] ) and ( [ numutau ] ) can be generally written as @xmath58 and @xmath59 respectively , having in mind that the sk detector does not measure @xmath60 and @xmath61 separately , but only their sum , @xmath62    analogously
, the rate of electrons produced per unit time and target deuterons in the sno detector through the charged current reaction  ( [ nud ] ) reads @xmath63 we stress that eqs .
( [ re][rsno ] ) are written in the most general way and with no approximation . a final remark about units .
if @xmath14 is given in @xmath64s@xmath65 and the cross sections in @xmath66 , then the rates @xmath67 are expressed in units of events per second per target particle ( electrons in sk and deuterons in sno ) , equivalent to @xmath68 generalized `` solar neutrino units '' ( snu s ) .
given that the molecular weight of water ( heavy water ) is 18 g / mol ( 20 g / mol ) , one snu corresponds to 28.9 event / kton / day in sk ( 5.2 event / kton / day in sno ) .
figure  1 shows the energy averaged cross sections @xmath69 and @xmath70 as a function of the sk threshold @xmath8 , as well as @xmath71 as a function of the sno threshold @xmath13 .
we remind that such cross sections include the effect of the detector energy resolution [ see eqs .
( [ sigmax],[barsigmax ] ) ] .
figure  2 shows the normalized response functions of sk ( @xmath72 and @xmath73 ) and sno ( @xmath74 ) as a function of the neutrino energy , for representative values of the detector thresholds . as shown in the previous section , the quantities in figs .  1 and 2
characterize completely the response of sk to @xmath17 scattering and of sno to @xmath75 absorption .    from fig .  2
, one can see that the response functions @xmath72 and @xmath73 are almost coincident ; for any practical purpose , one can assume that @xmath76 to a very good approximation .
this is not surprising , since the cross sections for @xmath77 and @xmath78 scattering have a similar shape in the range probed by sk , up to an overall factor @xcite .
it is more intriguing to notice that the sk and sno response functions in fig .  2
happen to be very similar , provided that the sno threshold is chosen about 2 mev below the sk threshold .
it appears that , using different thresholds and with the help of the energy resolution smearing , the differences in the sk and sno cross sections ( weighted by the @xmath4b neutrino spectrum ) can be largely compensated .    for each fixed value of @xmath8
, we have then maximized the agreement between @xmath79 and @xmath80 by tuning @xmath13 , so as to minimize the integral reminder @xmath81 the results are shown in fig .  3 for some representative values of the thresholds .
one sees that the two response functions @xmath72 and @xmath74 can be equalized to a good approximation .
indeed , we find that the reminder @xmath82 is always @xmath83 .
we find that the values of @xmath84 that minimize @xmath82 satisfy the approximate relation @xmath85 ( mev ) , with an accuracy sufficient for practical purposes .
of course , if the true sno energy resolution function turns out be different from our prospective shape [ see eqs .
( [ r],[delta ] ) ] , this relation can also change slightly .
the comparison of the sk and sno response functions should be finalized when the sno detector will be operated and calibrated .    in short , in the calculations of the electron rates @xmath5 and
@xmath11 one can take @xmath86 within an accuracy of a few percent or less , provided that the sk and sno thresholds obey the empirical relation @xmath87 the model - independent consequences of the two equations above will be worked out in the next section .
we point out that the comparison of the response functions of solar neutrino experiments have always provided useful insights in the interpretation of the solar neutrino problem .
for instance , an empirical equality between the response functions of the homestake and kamiokande experiments to the @xmath4b neutrino flux was used in @xcite and later in @xcite to make some model - independent statements on the @xmath4b flux suppression .
an equality similar to eq .
( [ eqsk ] ) was used in @xcite to derive a lower bound on the @xmath4b flux .
even _ inequalities _ between response functions have been used to study or constrain the neutrino oscillation probabilities @xcite . however , to our knowledge , eqs .
( [ eqsno],[thresh ] ) have not been derived prior to this work .
in this section we derive the model - independent consequences of the empirical equality ( [ eqsno ] ) , which holds with a precision of a few percent or less , when @xmath13 and @xmath88 satisfy eq .
( [ thresh ] ) .
we also discuss the associated uncertainties .    from eqs .
( [ re][rsno ] ) and eqs  ( [ eqsno],[thresh ] ) one easily derives a first important relation , @xmath89 which allows to determine in a model independent way the fractional contribution of ( purely neutral current ) @xmath2 interactions to the total @xmath17 scattering rate @xmath61 in super - kamiokande .
we stress that the above equation _ does not depend _ on either @xmath14 or the probability functions @xmath90 ; in particular , it holds also for nonzero mixing with a sterile neutrino , @xmath91 .    under the hypothesis of no oscillations into sterile states , @xmath92 ,
a second important relation can be derived from eqs .
( [ re][rsno ] ) and eqs  ( [ eqsno],[thresh ] ) : @xmath93\ . \label{ii}\ ] ] the above equation gives @xmath14 independently of the functional form of @xmath94 .
equations  ( [ i ] ) and ( [ ii ] ) represent the main results of our work .
a supplementary relation can be derived from eqs .
( [ re][rsk ] ) and ( [ eqsk ] ) , under the hypothesis that @xmath92 _ and _ that the boron neutrino flux @xmath14 is known independently ( e.g. , from standard solar models ) : @xmath95 the above equation makes use of sk data only ( @xmath5 ) and does not depend on @xmath94 ; however , its uselfuness is limited by the requirement of a prior knowledge of @xmath14 . using a recent standard solar model calculation of @xmath14 @xcite and the latest sk data @xcite the term subtracted from unity in eq .
( [ iii ] ) amounts to @xmath96 .
we will use this model - dependent value only for some prospective error estimates , as we discuss in the following .    in order to extract @xmath97 by means of eq .
( [ i ] ) , one has to consider both theoretical and experimental errors .
theoretical errors are of two different types : ( i ) uncertainties in the cross section ratio @xmath98 ; and ( ii ) approximations implicit in eq .
( [ eqsno ] ) .
the first are dominated by the overall normalization of the cc cross section for @xmath75 absorption , whose uncertainty is about @xmath99 @xcite .
concerning the approximations implicit in eq .
( [ eqsno ] ) one should note that , if @xmath100 , then the right - hand side of eq .
( [ i ] ) acquires an additional `` error term '' equal to @xmath101 . the integral reminder @xmath82 ( see eq .
( [ delta ] ) ) gives an upper limit to @xmath102 , as @xmath103 .
actually , @xmath104 is much smaller than @xmath82 in several oscillation cases of fenomenological interest ( e.g. , for both vacuum and matter enhanced solutions to the solar neutrino problem ) .
we have checked that @xmath105 in the worst cases .
if standard solar models are not too wrong , the factor @xmath106 in @xmath107 is in the range @xmath108@xmath109 ( as the rate observed in sk is about 1/21/3 than rate expected ) .
therefore , we estimate that the approximations implicit in eq .
( [ eqsno ] ) introduce at most an error @xmath110 in equation eq .
( [ i ] ) .
being much smaller than the uncertainty ( i ) , this error can be neglected .
we also checked that this conclusion holds when allowance is made for variations of the sk ( sno ) energy resolution function within the quoted @xcite ( prospected @xcite ) errors .
concerning the experimental uncertainties in eq .
( [ i ] ) , they are associated with the term @xmath111 . the present fractional error of @xmath5 is 34% [ eq .
( [ r1],[r2 ] ) ] .
however , the fractional error for @xmath11 can not be precisely evaluated before sno starts operation and its background is measured .
if we assume , conservatively , a total ( sno+sk ) uncertainty of @xmath112 for @xmath111 , then the total fractional error of the subtracted term in eq .  ( [ i ] ) is @xmath113 ( theoretical and experimental errors added in quadrature ) .
of course , the central value of the subtracted term ( i.e. , of the @xmath1 contribution to the total sk rate ) can only be guessed at present . if we take the value @xmath114 from the discussion following eq .
( [ iii ] ) , then @xmath115 , implying that the @xmath2 signal can be extracted at @xmath116 from eq .
( [ i ] ) .    concerning the estimate of @xmath14 from eq .
( [ ii ] ) , one expects an uncertainty of about 20% from the same arguments .
this value is comparable to the uncertainty affecting the theoretical estimates of @xmath14 from solar models @xcite and to the expected error of the neutral current event rate in sno @xcite ( which also provides @xmath14 in the absence of sterile neutrino oscillations @xcite ) .
therefore , eq .  ( [ ii ] ) provides us with a competitive , independent estimate of the the boron neutrino flux . of course , all these error estimates should be finalized when the actual data from sk and sno will be compared .
finally , we remind that eqs .
( [ i],[ii ] ) hold when the cross sections are expressed in @xmath66 , the rates in events per target particle per second , and @xmath14 in @xmath64s@xmath65 .
we think it useful to rewrite and summarize our results by using also the following units : @xmath117=[r_{\rm sno}]= { \rm kton}^{-1}{\rm d}^{-1}$ ] , @xmath118={\rm cm}^{-2}{\rm s}^{-1}$ ] , and @xmath119={\rm cm}^2 $ ] .
then , independently of the functional form of the oscillation probabilities @xmath34 , one has : @xmath120 and @xmath121 provided that the sk and and sno thresholds obey the empirical eq .
( [ thresh ] ) . for these joint values of thresholds
, we have tabulated the relevant cross sections in table  i.    we conclude with a numerical example . choosing a threshold @xmath122 mev for sk , the corresponding observed event rate @xmath5 is estimated to be 0.61 events / kton / day [ eq .
( [ r2 ] ) ] .
the sno threshold appropriate for comparison with sk is @xmath123 mev [ see eq .
( [ thresh ] ) ] . if sno measures , say ,
8 events / kton / day above such threshold , then one obtains , using the cross sections in table  i , @xmath124 [ for any @xmath125 , eq .
( [ sum1 ] ) ] and @xmath126 [ for @xmath92 , eq .
( [ sum2 ] ) ] .
we have found that an approximate equality holds between the super - kamiokande and sno ( charged current ) response functions [ eq .  ( [ eqsno ] ) ] , provided that their thresholds @xmath8 and @xmath13 are chosen appropriately [ eq .
( [ thresh ] ) ] .
we have taken advantage of this property , by showing that one needs only two data ( the total electron rates @xmath127 and @xmath11 ) to determine , in a model independent way , two important quantities : ( a ) the @xmath2 contribution to the sk signal , even in the presence of additional mixing with a sterile neutrino [ eq .  ( [ sum1 ] ) ] ; and ( b ) the absolute boron neutrino flux , in the absence of oscillations into sterile states [ eq .  ( [ sum2 ] ) ] .
therefore , the measurement of the total charged current event rate in sno appears to be very interesting and informative in itself , and not only in relation with the neutral current measurement to be performed in the same experiment .

 we also show how to determine the absolute @xmath4b neutrino flux from the same data set , independently of the @xmath1 survival probability . "
"nova explosions are caused by thermonuclear runaways on white dwarfs accreting hydrogen from a main sequence companion in a cataclysmic variable .
the explosive burning of hydrogen on the top of a co or an one degenerate core leads to the synthesis of some @xmath12 unstable nuclei , such as 13 , 14 , 15 , 17 and 18 .
these nuclei have short lifetimes ( @xmath51 - 2 minutes for 14 , 15 and 17 , @xmath515 min for 13 and @xmath53 hours for 18 ) , and they emit a positron when they decay . these positrons annihilate with electrons leading to the emission of photons with energy less or equal to 511 kev . furthermore , other medium- and long - lived radiocative nuclei are synthesized in classical novae : 7 ( @xmath13=77days ) , whichs emits a photon of 478 kev after an electron capture , 22 ( @xmath13=3.75yr ) and 26 ( @xmath13=1.04@xmath14 yr ) , which experience a @xmath12-decay emitting photons of 1275 and 1809 kev , respectively .
thus , classical novae are potential @xmath4-ray emitters , as was pointed out in previous works ( clayton & hoyle @xcite , clayton @xcite , leising & clayton @xcite )
. there are also some previous works concerning nucleosynthesis in classical novae ( see politano et al @xcite , prialnik & kovetz @xcite and references therein for nucleosynthesis in one and co novae , respectively , as well as hernanz et al @xcite , jos et al @xcite , jos & hernanz @xcite and @xcite ) .
but to our knowledge there are no previous works which follow all the phases ( from the accretion stage to the final explosion and mass ejection phases ) and couple them to the study of the @xmath4-ray emission of classical novae .    in this paper
we have used realistic profiles of densities , velocities and chemical compositions ( obtained by means of a hydrodynamical code ) to determine the production and transfer of @xmath4-rays ( by means of a monte - carlo code ) during nova explosions . in this way , we are able to do a detailed analysis of the @xmath4-ray emission of classical novae and predict their detectability by instruments onboard the cgro ( see our previous paper by hernanz et al for our first results and their relation to the future mission integral ) .
we are mainly concerned by the emission and potential detectability of individual novae , related to the decay of the medium - lived nuclei 7 and 22 ( besides of the short - lived nuclei 13 and 18 ) .
in table 1 we present the main properties of the ejecta of some of the most representative models we have computed ( accretion rate 2@xmath15.yr@xmath16 ) . there is an important difference between co and one novae : co novae are important producers of 7 ( thus line emission at 478 kev is expected during some days ) , whereas one novae are important producers of 22 ( thus line emission at 1275 kev during the first years after the explosion is expected ) .
this can clearly be seen by comparing the @xmath4-ray spectra of a typical co nova ( co1 ) and those of an one one ( one2 ) , shown in figure 1 for different epochs after the explosion . in all cases
a continuum component , mainly below 511 kev , appears as well as some lines ( 511 kev in all cases and 478 kev and 1275 kev in co and one novae , respectively ) .
two phases can be distinguished in the evolution of all models . during the early expansion , the ejected envelope is optically thick and there is an important contribution of the continuum below 511 kev , related to the comptonization of 511 kev photons .
later on , when the envelope becomes optically thin , absorption and comptonization become negligible ; therefore , the intensity of the lines is exclusively determined by the total mass of the radioactive nuclei 7 ( co novae ) and 22 ( one novae ) .
the main properties of the lines are shown in table 2 .
it is worth noticing that fluxes are rather low , due to the small ejected masses ( see table 1 ) .
this explains the null results of the observations of the 1275 kev emission by some novae made with comptel onboard cgro ( iyudin et al @xcite ) .
our predicted fluxes are fully compatible with the upper limits obtained in that work .
it is also worth noticing the important fluxes associated with the 511 kev line that we predict for all models ( see table 2 ) .
this flux should be detected by the current instruments onboard the cgro , provided that novae are observed very early after their explosion .
a retrospective analysis of the batse data would perhaps provide important clues to this issue ( see fishman et al @xcite ) .
we want to mention that there is a lack of agreement between all the theoretical models of novae ( including ours ) and some observations of ejected masses of classical novae , although large uncertainties affect sometimes the determination of observed ejected masses .
for instance , our model one1 fits quite well the observed abundances of the neon nova qu vul 1984 , but observations of this nova give an ejected mass that can reach @xmath17(saizar et al 1992 ) , almost two orders of magnitude larger than the theoretical one .
thus the flux of the 1275 kev line could be considerably larger , but no theoretical models are by now able to produce simultaneously such large ejected masses and neon in the ejecta .
.main properties of the ejecta one hour after peak temperature .
initial mass , total ejected mass and ejected mass of the most relevant radioactive nuclei are in and the mean kinetic energy of the ejecta , @xmath18 , is in erg.g@xmath16 [ cols='<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ ' , ]     ( 15,8 ) ( 0,0)(7,8 ) ( 7.5,0)(7,8 )    in figure 2 we show the light curves of the 478 and 1275 kev lines for co and one models , respectively .
for the 478 kev line two different phases can be distinguished : during the first @xmath51.5 days , the line is completely dominated by the continuum generated by 13 and 18 decays , whereas later on the line follows the typical light curve of the 7 radioactive decay , with @xmath13=77 days .
the 1275 kev line has a rise phase lasting @xmath57days , followed by a decline related to the decay of 22 .
the small fluxes obtained make it impossible to detect this line with the current cgro instruments , unless a very close explosion occurs ( the same as for the future spi instrument onboard integral ) .    concerning the light curve of the 511 kev line for all the models , as several isotopes , with different decay timescales ,
contribute to this emission , its temporal evolution is somewhat complex . besides one very early maximum appearing in the co novae ( related to 13 decay ) , one later maximum appears in all cases at @xmath5 6 hours ( see table 2 ) , which is related to 18 decay .
the further development of the light curves is different in the co and in the one cases : in the one case , as 22 emits a e@xmath19 when it decays , the emission at 511 kev lasts for a longer time ( as the 22 decay- timescale is much longer than the 18 one ) .
an early observation of a nova explosion , either of a co or an one one , would provide a positive detection of the 511 kev line ( an estimation of the detection distance of our novae by the future spi instrument onboard integral yields around 10 kpc for all of them except for the low - mass co1 model ) .
( 15,8 ) ( 0,0)(7,8 ) ( 7.5,0)(7,8 )
we have developed a monte - carlo code in order to treat the production and transfer of @xmath4-rays in nova envelopes , coupled to a hydrodynamical code that provides realistic profiles of all the relevant magnitudes .
thus a complete view of the nova explosion is obtained .
the most relevant features of the @xmath4-ray emission of classical novae are their intense 511 kev emission , lasting only some hours , the 478 kev emision in the case of co novae , related to 7 decay , and the 1275 kev emission in the case of one novae , related to 22 decay .
the 1275 kev emission is the most long - lived one , but the fluxes obtained are too low to be detected for novae at typical distances , thus explaining the negative detections of the novae observed up to now by comptel .

190 - 192 ." ," an implicit hydrodynamic code following the explosion of classical novae , from the accretion phase up to the final ejection of the envelope , has been coupled to a monte - carlo code able to simulate their gamma - ray emission . 
 carbon - oxygen ( co ) and oxygen - neon ( one ) novae have been studied and their gamma - ray spectra have been obtained , as well as the gamma - ray light curves for the important lines ( e@xmath0e@xmath1 annihilation line at 511 kev , @xmath2be decay - line at 478 kev and @xmath3na decay - line at 1275 kev ) . 
 the detectability of the emission by cgro instruments has been analyzed . 
 it is worth noticing that the @xmath4-ray signature of a co nova is different from that of an one one . in the co case 
 , the 478 kev line is very important , but lasts only for @xmath52 months . in the one case 
 , the 1275 kev line is the dominant one , lasting for @xmath5 4 years . in both cases , 
 the 511 kev line is the most intense line at the beginning , but its short duration ( @xmath52 days ) makes it very difficult to be detected . 
 it is shown that the negative results from the observations made by comptel up to now are consistent with the theoretical predictions . 
 predictions of the future detectability by the integral mission are also made .

"the discovery of surface enhanced raman scattering has reinforced the interest in the study of the optical properties of rough metallic surfaces , in particular the understanding of near - field features .
we consider the reflection of an electromagnetic wave on the grating described on figure [ fig.geom ] .
this grating is supposed to be infinite in the @xmath0-direction and periodic in the @xmath1-direction , with period @xmath2 .
the grating consists of grooves of width @xmath3 and depth @xmath4 .
the width @xmath3 ( and in practice the period @xmath2 , see @xcite and physical parameters , section [ sec.param ] ) is supposed to be smaller than the wavelength .
the dimensions of this grating give rise to two effects when exposed to tm - polarized light .
first , since its period is of the order of the optical wavelength , experiments show extinctions of the specular reflectivity at specific incident angles .
these extinctions stem from the transfer of energy to surface plasmons , which are very intense and propagate along the surface . besides the studied gratings have also a depth of the order of the wavelength and this yields resonances inside the cavity .
given a monochromatic incident wave with a wave vector of modulus @xmath5 , we want to compute the reflected modes in the domain ( i ) and the cavity modes in the cavities ( ii ) , such that the resulting magnetic field @xmath6 is solution to the helmholtz equation @xmath7    we apply here the modal development method @xcite , which consists in writing the field in ( i ) and ( ii ) as a sum of modes and using continuity properties to link both expansions .
this method has the advantage to lead to very simple and efficient computations .
other more elaborate methods have also been successfully applied to diffraction gratings , such as integral methods , coupling of finite elements and rayleigh expansion ,   ( see e.g. @xcite ) .
this computation requires a choice for the treatment of the surface which is covered with gold .
modal computations can be easily made treating all the gold surfaces with a perfectly conducting boundary condition ( perfect metal ) . in @xcite , walls ( vertical surfaces ) are treated with such a condition and horizontal surfaces with a surface impedance condition ( real metal ) .
our aim here is to compare these computations with full real - metal ones and to analyze the impact of the surface condition choice on the computed mode coefficients .    in section [ sec.setting ]
we describe the modal development and the different boundary conditions addressed .
we give the general outline of the modal method and the physical parameters used for the simulations which reproduce experiments . in section [ sec.modes ] , we explain how to find the cavity modes , perform an asymptotic expansion of the @xmath8th modal wave number in terms of @xmath8 and of the surface impedance , and study cavity mode energies .
we also show that these modes span the functional space of interest , which justifies _ a posteriori _ the use of the modal method , even for real - metal surface conditions . in section [ sec.num ] ,
we give hints on how to tune numerical parameters to obtain qualitatively good results compared to specular reflectance experimental measures . on the way
, we compare @xcite - type computations and the full real - metal case and end up with cavity mode results .
given an incident wave @xmath9 with a wave vector of modulus @xmath5 and an angle @xmath10 with respect to the vertical direction ( see figure [ fig.geom ] ) , the reflected waves in domain ( i ) are only those which stem from constructive interferences and are given by a rayleigh expansion @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( @xmath14 is chosen to have a non - negative imaginary part ) .
in particular , @xmath15 is @xmath2-quasi - periodic : @xmath16 . only a finite number of these waves , corresponding to a real @xmath14 , are propagative .
one of our goals is to determine the reflection coefficients @xmath17 , @xmath18 .
the second goal is to determine the cavity modes .
we seek them in the sheng @xcite mode decomposition , i.e. @xmath19 is written as a superposition of waves of the type @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are solution to @xmath23 .
impedance conditions are used to model the interface between a dielectric medium and a metal .
indeed we do not want to model the electromagnetic wave which penetrates in the metal within the skin depth , but replace it by the condition @xmath24 where @xmath8 is the exterior normal of the metallic surface and @xmath25 ( for the usual determination of the square root ) is the relative surface impedance , computed from the relative dielectric constants @xmath26 and @xmath27 of the dielectric medium and the metal respectively . here
the dielectric medium is air and we denote @xmath28 . for a real metal
the dielectric constant is complex and consists of a large negative real part and a smaller imaginary part .
numerical values of @xmath29 stemming from @xcite are given on table [ tab.xi ] .
considering a perfect metal interface consists in letting @xmath30 , which yields @xmath31 and a neumann boundary condition @xmath32 .
we compare the following assumptions on the metallic surfaces ( see also figure [ fig.cases ] ) :    ( p ) case : : :    perfect metal ( neumann condition ) everywhere ; ( m@xmath33 ) case : : :    perfect metal on walls and real metal on horizontal surfaces    neglecting @xmath34 ; ( m ) case : : :    same as ( m@xmath33 ) but taking into account    @xmath34 ( mixed case of @xcite ) ; ( r@xmath33 ) case : : :    real metal ( impedance condition ) everywhere neglecting    @xmath34 ; ( r ) case : : :    same as ( r@xmath33 ) but taking into account    @xmath34 .
we follow the computations in @xcite which consist in three steps :    step 1 . : :    take into account the boundary condition on the vertical walls .
this    defines a relation between @xmath35 and @xmath36 in ,    and discrete values for @xmath21 which we denote by    @xmath37 , @xmath38 .
the corresponding values    @xmath39 of @xmath22 follow immediately .
: :    take into account the boundary condition on the bottom of the cavity .
this defines a relation between @xmath40 and @xmath41 in    .
: :    write a linear combination of the cavity modes corresponding to the    contributions for the different values of @xmath8 and take    into account the conditions on the surface @xmath42 ( for    @xmath43 $ ] ) using also .
the impedance condition    yields each reflection coefficient @xmath17 ,    @xmath18 in terms of the amplitudes @xmath44 ,    @xmath38 , of each cavity mode . the continuity of the    fields above the cavity ( for @xmath45 $ ] ) yields    cavity mode amplitudes in terms of the reflection coefficients .
it    leads to a linear system relating the cavity mode amplitudes , which we    can solve , and from which we can deduce the values of the reflection    coefficients .      in the numerical experiments , we use exactly the same parameters as in @xcite , namely a cavity width of @xmath46 , a periodicity of @xmath47 and a cavity height of @xmath48 .
the incident wave angle is @xmath49 and the wavenumber varies between @xmath50 and @xmath51 . to compute @xmath5 in s.i .
units , we have to multiply these values by @xmath52 , and therefore @xmath5 ranges from @xmath53 to @xmath54 .
the monomode mixed case corresponds to sub - half - wavelength cavities : @xmath55 . we refer to @xcite for values of @xmath27 for gold in this frequency range .
the profile of the cavity modes is given by the first two steps given in section [ sec.method ] .
we first determine the @xmath1-dependance of the cavity modes , i.e. the values of @xmath21 such that the functions @xmath56 are solution to @xmath57    in the ( p ) , ( m@xmath33 ) , and ( m ) cases , the wall boundary condition is a perfect metal condition , therefore @xmath31 , and this problem is self - adjoint , leading to equally spaced horizontal modes : @xmath58 for @xmath38 , and the simple relation @xmath59 . + in the ( r@xmath33 ) and ( r ) cases , the above eigenvalue problem case can be seen as a perturbation of the self - adjoint case @xmath31 .
we once more have @xmath60 , where @xmath61 , but the values of @xmath37 are not explicit any more but only solution to a transcendental equation @xmath62    for all @xmath38 , we define the cavity mode @xmath63      in the ( r@xmath33 ) case , @xmath27 is real and @xmath29 is therefore purely imaginary .
the corresponding values of @xmath37 are real and the equation can be solved in the real domain .
this can be easily done with a good precision by using e.g. dichotomy and a very fine step .
these first numerical results show that @xmath37 is very close to @xmath64 for @xmath65 .
if now @xmath34 is taken into account ( as in the ( r ) case ) , @xmath66 and @xmath37 is no more real : the numerical determination in the complex domain is a bit more delicate .
it involves some determinant which has to be positive to find a relevant solution and it happens to be positive only around @xmath64 , @xmath38 .
we therefore look for a solution of in the form @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is small .
it is then clear that @xmath69 and @xmath68 is solution to the `` simpler '' equation @xmath70      for @xmath65 and @xmath71 in some bounded set of the complex plane ( which is valid for our application ) , we write an expansion of @xmath68 in terms of @xmath72 and find that @xmath73 we have to go relatively far in the expansion since @xmath71 is not very small as shows table [ tab.xi ] .
.[tab.xi]value of @xmath74 and @xmath75 with respect to the wave number @xmath5 ( in @xmath76 ) , derived from values of @xmath27 @xcite . [ cols='>,^,^,^,^,^,^,^',options='header ' , ]     the dependance of modes @xmath77 and @xmath78 of the ( r ) case with respect to the wavenumber is shown on figure [ fig.mu_n ] .

values of @xmath79 ( a ) and @xmath80 ( b ) with respect to the wave number for modes @xmath77 and 2 . ]      in the previous expansions we have not treated the case @xmath81 .
we are guided by the simple computation @xmath82 this is clearly impossible in the ( r@xmath33 ) case , where this is equivalent to @xmath83 , where @xmath84 ( see table [ tab.xi ] ) and @xmath85 should be real . on the contrary ,
it is possible to solve this in the complex domain in the ( r ) case , it is natural to seek an expansion of the first mode @xmath85 in terms of @xmath86 , yielding only odd terms : @xmath87    the dependance of this first mode with respect to the wavenumber in the ( r ) case is shown on figure [ fig.mu_0 ] .
values of @xmath88 and @xmath89 with respect to the wave number . ]
the fundamental mode plotted on figure [ fig.mu_0 ] shows an almost constant imaginary part and a larger real part for low wavenumbers .
this behavior is quite different from the higher order modes ( the first two being displayed on figure [ fig.mu_n ] ) where @xmath90 increases with @xmath91 .
if we had plotted @xmath92 in the ( r@xmath33 ) case , the picture would have been very close to the real parts displayed on figure [ fig.mu_n](a ) .
this behavior of the fundamental mode clearly does not `` pass to the limit '' as the permittivity becomes real , and this is another evidence of the absence of a small mode in the ( r@xmath33 ) case .
the ( r@xmath33 ) case , which could be considered as more precise as the ( m@xmath33 ) is in fact not at all suitable for modal computations ( see also the first numerical test cases in section [ sec.monomode ] ) .
we now want to show that we can use the above defined modes as a basis of functions in the cavity .
completeness of the eigenfunctions follows from the same argument as in the similar context of @xcite .
we indeed follow the result of @xcite :    [ th.kato ] let @xmath93 be a complete orthonormal family in a separable hilbert space @xmath94 and let @xmath95 be a sequence such that @xmath96 . then @xmath95 is a basis of @xmath94 if @xmath97 implies that @xmath98 for all @xmath99 .
[ prop.basis ] the cavity modes @xmath100 form a basis of @xmath101 .
we denote @xmath102 , @xmath38 , the functions @xmath103 defined by equation in the cases ( p ) , ( m@xmath33 ) or ( m ) where @xmath58 . to prove proposition [ prop.basis ] we renormalize our functions @xmath103 and @xmath104 , to @xmath105 and @xmath106 .
taking @xmath107 and @xmath108 for @xmath109 , it is a classical result that @xmath106 is an orthonormal basis of @xmath101 . for each @xmath109 , we want to find @xmath110 such that @xmath111 is minimal .
we first compute @xmath112 where @xmath113 the minimum value of @xmath114 , clearly obtained when @xmath115 , is @xmath116 an explicit computation leads to @xmath117 using the previously obtained expansion of @xmath68 @xmath118 and finally @xmath119 we therefore have @xmath120 . + now if we compute explicitely @xmath121 the fact that @xmath37 and @xmath122 both are solution to leads to @xmath123 if @xmath124
. we simply denote @xmath125 in the sequel .
therefore @xmath126 leads to @xmath127 for all @xmath8 and , following theorem [ th.kato ] , @xmath128 ( and of course also @xmath129 ) is a basis of @xmath101 .
the computations of the second step are the same in all cases , and lead for each @xmath8 to the @xmath8th cavity mode profile : @xmath130 where @xmath131 .
the ( p ) , ( m@xmath33 ) , and ( m ) cases can also be cast like this with the specific values @xmath58 .
the field in the cavity consists of a superposition of these modes : @xmath132 the determination of the square root @xmath133 is of great importance .
indeed , if we choose the usual determination , where @xmath134 , then @xmath135 is huge if evanescent modes are taken into account .
this is shown on figure [ fig.energy_pos ] , where the logarithm of the energies @xmath136 of the first cavity modes is given : @xmath137     @xmath138 for @xmath134 and for @xmath81 , 1 , 2 in the ( m ) case ( a ) , and the ( r ) case ( b ) . ]
@xmath138 for @xmath134 and for @xmath81 , 1 , 2 in the ( m ) case ( a ) , and the ( r ) case ( b ) . ]
the role of the presence of the evanescent modes is clear : in the ( m ) case , above @xmath139 , the theoretical limit of the monomode case ( as computed in section  [ sec.param ] ) , where only the first mode is non - evanescent , @xmath140 has a moderate size ( figure [ fig.energy_pos](a ) ) . in the ( r ) case , the notion of an evanescent mode is slightly different since @xmath37 has always a real and an imaginary part .
we see on figure [ fig.energy_pos](b ) that the upper limit of the ( r)-monomode case is @xmath141 .
having such different magnitudes ( contrast of about 15 decades ) in the description of the total wave @xmath142 will lead to a very poor conditioning of the linear system we shall eventually invert ( see section [ sec.cond ] ) .
if we make the opposite choice and have @xmath143 , the magnitude of @xmath136 is always relatively moderate , as shown on figure [ fig.energy_neg ] .
@xmath138 for @xmath143 and for @xmath81 , 1 , 2 in the ( m ) case ( a ) , and the ( r ) case ( b ) . ]     @xmath138 for @xmath143 and for @xmath81 , 1 , 2 in the ( m ) case ( a ) , and the ( r ) case ( b ) . ]
now the difference of magnitude of the different modes at a given frequency is of the order of 100 , which is quite acceptable .
choosing the sign of @xmath144 is only choosing a way to normalize the cavity modes .
the impedance condition ( the quantity @xmath145 is vanishing on @xmath146 ) and the continuity of the fields are projected in the @xmath147 sense in two ways :    * firstly in @xmath148 on functions @xmath149 , filtering this oscillation in @xmath150 to recover the reflection coefficient @xmath17 ; * secondly in @xmath101 on functions @xmath151 , yielding the cavity mode coefficients @xmath44 .
we therefore compute @xmath152 which yields the reflection mode amplitudes in terms of the cavity mode amplitudes : @xmath153,\ ] ] where @xmath154 is the aspect ratio , @xmath155 is the kronecker delta , and @xmath156 we also project the continuity condition above the cavity @xmath157 for @xmath158 onto the functions @xmath159 @xmath160 which yields the cavity mode amplitudes in terms of the reflection mode amplitudes : @xmath161 where @xmath162 with as usual @xmath163 , for all @xmath164 .
we can plug in and find an infinite dimensional linear system @xmath165 .
to solve the linear system numerically an assumption has to be made on the number of relevant modes , which leads to a finite dimensional system .
restricting the number of modes destroys the continuity at the interface between the two regions ( i ) and ( ii ) .
let @xmath166 be the number of cavity modes and @xmath167 the number of reflected modes kept for the computations .
one possible way to choose these values is to keep only propagative waves , i.e. reflected waves for which @xmath14 is real ( and cavity waves for which @xmath39 is real in the mixed case ) .
the conditioning of matrix @xmath168 is an important issue , except in the monomode case ( @xmath169 ) where @xmath168 is a scalar .
we have foreseen in section [ sec.profile ] that taking @xmath143 certainly leads to better conditioned systems .
this is indeed the case as shown on figure [ fig.condition ] where we show the conditioning of matrix @xmath168 for the ( m ) case ( the ( r ) case would be similar but slightly less critical ) for both @xmath134 and @xmath143 with @xmath170 and @xmath169 , 2 and 3 .
impact of the sign of @xmath144 and the number of cavity modes kept in the computations on the condition number in the ( m ) case : ( a ) @xmath134 ; ( b ) @xmath143 . ]
impact of the sign of @xmath144 and the number of cavity modes kept in the computations on the condition number in the ( m ) case : ( a ) @xmath134 ; ( b ) @xmath143 . ]
we see that the conditioning of @xmath168 is not sensitive to @xmath166 if @xmath143 .
we do not show the plots here , but the conditioning is also not sensitive to @xmath167 .
a plot with @xmath171 would be very similar .
we stress the fact that the solutions are not affected by the very poor conditioning because the entries of @xmath172 also show magnitude differences if @xmath134 .
it seems however better to use @xmath143 and a well - conditioned system .
another way to have a reasonable conditioning is to take advantage of the fact that reflected modes and cavity modes play a symmetric role .
if we replace the system in the variable @xmath35 ( @xmath165 ) by a system @xmath173 , the conditioning is very similar to that displayed on figure [ fig.condition](b ) .
let @xmath174 . with our physical values
@xmath175 up to @xmath176 , then @xmath177 up to @xmath178 and @xmath179 above . peaks on figure [ fig.condition ] seem to occur at these values .      to validate our approach , we try to reproduce experiments with the physical parameters given in section [ sec.param ] .
it is possible to measure the propagative reflected waves and therefore we can define the specular reflectance @xmath180 and the total reflectance @xmath181 .      for narrow cavities ( @xmath182 )
it is admitted that only a single mode can be kept in the cavity .

we see on these plots that the perfect and mixed cases behave relatively similarly , at least for large wavenumbers .
the ( p ) and ( m@xmath33 ) cases totally miss the first dip close to @xmath189 . as predicted in @xcite ,
considering real metallic surfaces on the walls ( ( r ) case ) allows to better catch this feature .
the ( r ) computations also give a better location of the decreasing part around @xmath190 .
the lack of fundamental mode totally disqualifies the ( m@xmath33 ) case for which the incident wave is totally reflected in the specular direction , whatever the wavenumber .    for the next tests we will now only compare the ( m ) and ( r ) cases , i.e. only compare the impact of the choice of the boundary condition for a real metal ( with a complex permittivity ) .
the computations displayed on figure [ fig.monomode ] have been performed with one cavity mode ( @xmath81 ) and 41 reflected waves @xmath191 .
we may ask about the incidence of this choice .
first let us investigate the case of reflected waves .
we remain in the monomode case but make different choices for the number of reflected waves @xmath167 .
figure [ fig.m ] shows the specular reflectance in the ( m ) and ( r ) cases with @xmath170 i.e. @xmath192 ( which yield very close results to the @xmath171 case used on figure [ fig.monomode ] ) , @xmath193 i.e. @xmath194 ( only the specular reflected wave ) and @xmath195 .
impact of the number of reflected waves kept in the computations on the specular reflectance in the ( m ) case ( a ) , and the ( r ) case ( b ) . for each case

, we used 5 reflected waves ( @xmath192 ) , the specular reflected wave ( @xmath194 ) or all the propagative reflected waves ( @xmath195 ) . ]    the comparison of the ( m ) and ( r ) cases leads to the same conclusion as in the monomode test case .
they both behave in the same way regarding the impact of the choice of the number of reflected wave . keeping
only the exact number of propagative waves does not seem enough to describe completely the phenomena , let alone keeping only the specular wave .
this huge impact can be clearly seen by considering the discontinuity at @xmath178 when using @xmath195 , i.e. when changing the number of reflected waves at this wavenumber .
now we investigate the impact of the number of cavity modes .
figure [ fig.n ] shows the specular reflectance in the ( m ) and ( r ) cases with @xmath169 , 2 and 3 modes .
recall that the monomode assumption is _ a priori _ valid up to @xmath139 .
considering the previous test case we have taken @xmath170 here .
impact of the number of cavity modes kept in the computations on the specular reflectance in the ( m ) case ( a ) , and the ( r ) case ( b ) . for each case
, we used 1 mode ( @xmath196 , 2 modes ( @xmath197 ) and 3 modes ( @xmath198 ) . ]    impact of the number of cavity modes kept in the computations on the specular reflectance in the ( m ) case ( a ) , and the ( r ) case ( b ) . for each case
, we used 1 mode ( @xmath196 , 2 modes ( @xmath197 ) and 3 modes ( @xmath198 ) . ]    in the ( m ) case , apart from already mentioned features , we notice that the approximation is much better by taking @xmath199 or 3 in the @xmath200@xmath201 range .
the rest of the results are not so much affected by the number of cavity modes kept in the computation .    in the ( r ) case
, we can note a dissociation between the dip below @xmath190 and the decrease between @xmath200 and @xmath201 .
when the monomode assumption is not valid anymore , the ( r ) case outperforms the ( m ) case if relevant cavity modes are kept .
contrarily to reflected modes , it is impossible to measure the cavity modes without changing them .
we therefore lack experimental data to compare the numerical results with .
we can only hope that computations which yield fair results regarding reflected waves will also yield a correct estimation of the amplitude of cavity modes .
we only investigate modes @xmath81 , 1 and 2 .
comparing the values of @xmath44 for the different methods would be pointless because it is multiplied by functions which can differ greatly in magnitude . to be able to show the dependance with respect to the wavenumber we plot the renormalized cavity mode amplitude @xmath202 .
figure [ fig.a_0 ] shows @xmath203 in the ( m ) and the ( r ) cases for different values of @xmath166 .

amplitude of the first renormalized cavity mode @xmath204 in the ( m ) case ( a ) , and the ( r ) case ( b ) when computing @xmath169 , 2 or 3 cavity modes . ]    the overall aspect is roughly always the same . when computing 1 mode , the ( m ) and ( r ) cases yield dips and bumps at about the same wavenumbers .
the impact of taking 2 or 3 cavity modes is low .
the peak around @xmath190 is very slightly shifted to the right .
a difference between the ( m ) and ( r ) cases is that the dip around @xmath205 disappears in the ( r ) case .
this certainly is connected with the same difference in the curves at those frequencies pointed out on figure [ fig.n ] . since the ( r ) case was then closer to the experimental reflectance results , we can expect that the cavity modes displayed on figure [ fig.a_0](b ) for 2 and 3 cavity modes are closer to reality .
now let us investigate the next two modes .
we plot on figure [ fig.a_n ] only the results for @xmath206 preferring to compare the ( m ) and the ( r ) cases .
amplitude of the ( a ) second @xmath207 and ( b ) third @xmath208 renormalized cavity modes in the ( m ) and ( r ) cases.,title='fig : ' ] +    amplitude of the ( a ) second @xmath207 and ( b ) third @xmath208 renormalized cavity modes in the ( m ) and ( r ) cases.,title='fig : ' ] +    as could be predicted from figure [ fig.energy_pos ] , the phenomena occur for smaller wavenumbers in the ( r ) case than in the ( m ) case .
they appear even sooner as figure [ fig.energy_pos ] would induce , which means that we should take into account the first evanescent modes even in the range where the monomode assumption is supposed to be valid .
we see that the second cavity mode can be predominant over the fundamental mode for some wavenumber .
this means that we can `` switch on '' almost pure second cavity modes for precise experimental settings .
we have investigated the role of the choice of boundary conditions on the description of reflected and cavity modes in sub - wavelength gratings . as one could expect
we have shown that a better agreement with experiments can be achieved by considering real - metal conditions on all boundaries .
using asymptotic expansions , we have found a mean to produce numerical simulations in this full metal case which are not much more intricate that the mixed case previously used in the literature . on the way we have studied the role of the numerical parameters used to solve the theoretical infinite dimensional systems , the need to keep a certain number of evanescent modes , and a way to perform computations without being perturbed by conditioning issues .

"apple undulators need to be installed in the linear regime , before the power emitted by the bunching undulator reaches @xmath10 gw.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]     in the sase regime , and is insensitive to the length of the baseline undulator.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    circularly polarized x - ray radiation is a useful tool for investigating magnetic materials and other material science issues , as discussed in @xcite-@xcite and references therein .
however , the lcls baseline @xcite is composed by a planar undulator system , which produces intense linearly polarized light in the wavelength range @xmath11 nm .
for hard x - ray radiation ( shorter than @xmath12 nm ) , longitudinally coherent , linearly polarized x - rays can be obtained with the help of self - seeding techniques , and converted @xcite into any other elliptic polarization state by passing them through x - ray phase retarders @xcite . for soft x - ray wavelengths
longer than @xmath12 nm , two main methods have been proposed to achieve circular polarization .
the first consists in letting the electron beam through helical undulator devices .
such devices @xcite are mechanically more complex than the simple , fixed gap planar undulator currently employed at the lcls , fig . [ lclspc7 ] . a second possibility , building on the work @xcite ,
is constituted by the use of crossed planar undulators tuned at a different frequency than the fundamental , fig .
[ lclspc8 ] .
these options are discussed e.g. in @xcite .
let us briefly describe the first option .
the option of a full - length helical undulator remains the most attractive in terms of quality of the output radiation .
however , its realization is not foreseen at the first stage of the lcls project mainly due to technical challenges related to the production of long helical insertion devices .
the choice of a relatively short helical undulator could initially constitute a reasonable compromise .
it is not necessary that all the undulators in the line be helical , fig .
[ lclspc7 ] .
in fact , since the sase process already provides electron beam microbunching , the microbunches radiates coherently when passing through an helical undulator tuned at the same radiation wavelength . at the lcls , saturation of
linearly polarized radiation at @xmath1 nm is reached after @xmath13 undulator modules .
the saturation power is about @xmath4 gw . in order to reach
more than @xmath5 degree of polarization , apple undulators need to be installed before the power reaches @xmath10 gw , i.e. in the fourth module @xcite .    considering the second option ,
a short pair of crossed planar undulator is placed behind the long planar undulator , fig .
[ lclspc8 ] .
the radiation in the baseline undulator is characterized by a different frequency compared to the radiation in the crossed undulator , and thus has no effect on the polarization properties of the harmonic fields .
the maximum circular degree of polarization achievable is over @xmath2 in the sase regime , and is insensitive to the length of the baseline undulator .
a scheme was also presented in @xcite , where the crossed undulators are tuned to the fundamental . in this case , if the crossed undulator length is @xmath14 times the fel gain length , the two orthogonal linear components turn out to produce radiation with the same intensities and their combination results in circular polarization if their phase difference is equal to @xmath15 .
the fel gain length , however , depends on a number parameters such as wavelength , peak current , emittance , energy spread , beta function .
some of them might fluctuate leading to fluctuations of the degree of polarization as well .    in a coaxial setup where the baseline lcls undulator is followed by a short radiator tuned at the same wavelength
, there is the issue of separation of linearly from circularly polarized radiation . in the option presented in @xcite ,
after the planar undulator the electron beam is deflected by a bending system and subsequently passed through a helical undulator .
the bending system serves to separate the linearly from the circularly polarized radiation .
the polarization properties of the radiator in this scheme are completely independent of the light produced in the undulator providing the bunching of the electron beam . using this scheme , the electron beam microbunching on the scale of the soft x - ray radiation wavelength produced in the planar undulator
must be maintained through the bending system , and this constitutes a challenge , which started to be addressed in literature only very recently .
according to @xcite , such a scheme would be as long as 80 m.     of incident power by slits without spoiling of electron beam , scaledwidth=100.0% ]    as a result only two main options were selected as candidates for the lcls upgrade , fig .
[ lclspc7 ] and fig .
[ lclspc8 ] . in this paper
we propose a third option , fig .
[ lclspc5 ] , which mainly consists sending the electron beam , after the passage in the baseline undulator , through a @xmath6 m long straight section , and subsequently through a short helical ( apple ii ) radiator .
the background radiation from the baseline undulator is suppressed by letting radiation and electron beam through horizontal and vertical slits upstream the helical radiator , where the radiation spot size is about ten times larger than the electron bunch transverse size . using thin beryllium foils for the slits the divergence of the electron beam halo
will be spoiled due to coulomb scattering , but the beam will propagate through the setup without electron losses .
our method presents obvious advantages compared with the previously proposed ones . in all three cases
one would obtain very high and stable degree of polarization , because all three options propose radical solutions of background problem .
the option proposed in this paper , however , has advantages over the first one in terms of costs and time , not only because our helical undulator would be shorter , but also because we can afford to use the existing design of apple ii type undulators , improved for petra iii @xcite , instead of apple iii type undulators @xcite , which have not yet come into operation .
comparing our technique with the crossed - undulator proposal , we have the advantage in terms of power and wavelength range . finally , to be specific here we restrict ourselves to the investigation of apple modules following the main undulator .
however , our scheme can also operate with any helical radiator , including e.g. crossed planar undulators allowing for fast helicity switching .
m. we assume that last five ( shab ) undulator modules are rolled away from the beamline in this fashion.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]     m - long apple ii undulator after the lcls baseline undulator will allow to produce high - power , highly circularly - polarized soft - x - ray radiation.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]                m - thick beryllium foil as a function of the energy in the @xmath16 ev-@xmath17 ev energy - range .
this thickness is enough to block the radiation from the first lcls undulator.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    the electron beam first goes through the baseline undulator , producing sase radiation , and inducing energy and density modulation on the electron beam .
this first step is illustrated in fig .
[ lclspc1 ] , where we also assume that the five second harmonic afterburner ( shab ) modules are rolled away @xcite from the beamline , fig .
[ lclspc2 ] . in this way
, we provide a total of @xmath6 m straight section for the electron beam , @xmath18 m corresponding to the shab modules , and further @xmath18 m corresponding to the straight section after the exit of the main undulator . at the end of the @xmath6 m - long straight section we install horizontal and vertical slits , and a @xmath19 m - long apple ii type undulator fig .
[ lclspc4 ] .
while passing through this last section , the microbunched electron beam produces intense bursts of radiation in any selected polarization state .
however , one should account for the fact that the straight section acts as a dispersive element . therefore , in a klystron - like bunching effect should also be accounted for , which modifies the density modulation at the exit of the first undulator . from this viewpoint , the first ( baseline )
lcls undulator behaves as an energy modulator , and the drift section , i.e. the straight section , transforms the energy into density modulation .
following these lines , before discussing the result of numerical simulations , we present here a qualitative treatment of the influence of the propagation of electron beam through the drift section on the electron beam microbunching .    the way the electron bunch is modulated in an optical klystron is quantitatively described in e.g. @xcite .
the current @xmath20 at the exit of the straight section is found to be a composition of harmonics of the fundamental frequency @xmath21 according to    @xmath22   j_n\left(n p_0 \frac{\omega r_{56}}{c { e}_0}\right)\cr & & \times \cos\left[n \omega \left(\frac{z}{v_z}-t\right)\right]~ , \label{czonca}\end{aligned}\ ] ]    where @xmath23 is the energy modulation after the first undulator , @xmath24 is the nominal electron energy , @xmath25 is the local energy spread of electrons , @xmath26 is the longitudinal coordinate , @xmath27 is the longitudinal velocity of electrons and @xmath28 is the time .
moreover @xmath29 indicates the bessel function of the first kind of order @xmath30 and , as before , @xmath31 is the momentum compaction factor .
let us consider the first harmonic bunching in eq .
( [ czonca ] ) , @xmath32 .
we assume @xmath33 gev , a fundamental wavelength @xmath34 nm , a straight section length @xmath35 m and @xmath36 mev energy spread .
we can estimate @xmath37 nm , with a relative rms energy spread of the @xmath38 .
the exponential factor in eq .
( [ czonca ] ) turns out to be about @xmath39 , i.e. reasonably near unity .
this means that modulation is not destroyed by the passage through the straight section .
moreover , it should be noted that this factor is energy dependent .
in particular , increasing the energy will scale down the wavelength as @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .
therefore , the exponential factor scales as @xmath43 , so that for wavelength shorter than @xmath1 nm , which is the case under study in our numerical example , the suppression factor will be even smaller .    with the help of eq .
( [ czonca ] ) we can estimate the maximal fel - induced energy modulation which can be tolerated in the electron beam after the baseline undulator .
this can be done requiring that the argument of the bessel function in eq .
( [ czonca ] ) be not larger than unity .
this fixes the maximal value of @xmath44 . at saturation ,
the energy modulation is comparable with the energy losses of the bunch , which is of the order of the relative bandwidth of the spectrum . in particular , for @xmath34 nm we have a bandwidth , and therefore , energy losses and energy modulation , in the order of @xmath45 .
comparing with the maximal value of @xmath46 , we conclude that the planar undulator should work in the linear regime , and that the fel power yielded in the first part of our setup should be about ten times smaller than at saturation . numerical simulations ( see section [ sims ] ) , confirm these estimations .
the influence of the betatron motion should be further accounted for .
in fact , the finite angular divergence of the electron beam , linked with the betatron function , leads to an additional spread in the longitudinal velocity and as a consequence to an additional suppression factor in eq .
( [ czonca ] ) .
we can estimate this factor by comparison with the influence of the energy spread .
the deviation in longitudinal velocity due to angular deviation is simply found as @xmath47 \sim - v\theta^2/2 $ ] .
considering @xmath48 as the rms angular divergence we estimate @xmath49 , where @xmath50 m is the geometrical emittance and @xmath51 m is the average betatron function used at @xmath34 nm . since the effect of the energy spread @xmath25 over @xmath52 is @xmath53 , we conclude that the betatron motion should not constitute a serious problem .
also note that if the focusing system is not varied with the energy , an energy increase results into a scaling of @xmath54 and @xmath55 , and there is no energy dependence on the effects of the betatron motion .
also note that the baseline undulator length is sufficient for operation at even higher betatron function in the order of @xmath56 m and in the drift section we are free to use , if needed higher betatron functions .
the choice of @xmath51 m at @xmath1 nm , equal to the betatron function in the baseline is discussed here for simplicity only , since it is advantageous , for feasibility study purposes to assume that there is no significant difference in the betatron function along the @xmath18 m - long drift section and in the shab undulator focusing system . from this viewpoint ,
the argument of the suppression factor due to the betatron motion effects goes with the square of the velocity spread yielding a dependence @xmath57 allowing for flexibility in the choice of @xmath58 .
after the straight section , electron beam and radiation pass through horizontal and vertical slits , suppressing the linearly - polarized soft x - ray radiation from the lcls baseline undulator .
since the slits are positioned 40 m downstream of the planar undulator , the radiation pulse has a ten times larger spot size compared with the electron bunch transverse size , and the background radiation power can therefore be diminished of two orders of magnitude , fig .
[ lclspc3 ] .
the slits can be made of beryllium foils , for a total thickness of @xmath59 m .
the transmission for a @xmath59m - thick beryllium foil is shown in fig .
[ transmb ] in the energy range between @xmath16 ev and @xmath17 ev . such a foil will block the radiation , but will let the electrons go through @xcite , fig .
[ lclspc6 ] .
thus , the advantage of the spoiling scheme is that radiation is attenuated of @xmath18 db , but while the halo of the electron bunch is allowed to propagate through the setup up to the beam dump without electron losses . in order to understand the effects of the foils on the electrons , we need to address multiple coulomb scattering in the foils . for estimations
, we use the following formula used to calculate the rms electron beam angular divergence for the same electron beam :    @xmath60 \sqrt{t / x0}~ , \label{mulsc}\end{aligned}\ ] ]    where @xmath61 is the electron momentum in mev / c , @xmath28 is thickness of foil , and @xmath62 is the radiation length of the material . for beryllium , @xmath63 cm . for a thickness @xmath64 m , this amounts to @xmath65 mrad . assuming an electron beam size on the foil of @xmath66 m rms , which can be obtained by proper tuning of the focusing system
, we obtain a spoiled emittance @xmath67 nm , corresponding to a normalized emittance @xmath68 m . such normalized emittance is well within the acceptance of the beamline optics . it should be noted that the emittance estimation is a conservative one , since only the electron beam halo , and not the main part of the beam , passes through the foils .
the energy perturbation due radiation losses through the foils can be easily estimated as @xmath69 .
we can also estimate influence of ionization losses .
the ratio of losses to ionization losses is about @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the atomic number and @xmath72 is energy of the electron beam . for beryllium , @xmath73 and we have ratio of order @xmath18 , meaning that we can neglect ionization losses .    finally , it should be noted that in the particular case of the lcls baseline , we have an additional suppression of a few times for the linearly polarized radiation background , which we did not actually accounted for in our calculations for the degree of polarization , due to the fact that the first lcls undulator operates in the linear regime .
following the previous section considering the method in detail and discussing estimations , here we present more detailed fel simulations with the help of the fel code genesis 1.3 @xcite running on a parallel machine .
we present a statistical analysis consisting of @xmath74 runs .
parameters used in the simulations for the low - charge mode of operation are presented in table [ tt1 ] .
the choice of the low - charge mode of operation is motivated by simplicity .
.parameters for the low - charge mode of operation at lcls used in this paper . [ cols='<,^,^',options='header ' , ]     [ tt1 ]                as discussed in the previous section , the baseline lcls undulator should work in the linear regime .
an optimum is found when only the last @xmath19 cells upstream of the shab are used .
in other words we assume that first 23 baseline undulator modules are detuned . the power and spectrum after the baseline undulator
are shown in fig .
[ powbuncher ] and fig .
[ spbuncher ] . fig .
[ angdis ] shows the x - ray radiation pulse energy distribution in the far zone , which is about @xmath75rad fwhm wide .
the particle file produced by genesis at the exit of baseline is subsequently transformed assuming a dispersive element with @xmath37 nm , and used as an input for further simulations through the @xmath19 m - long apple type undulator . the average betatron function is assumed to be @xmath51 m. from a practical viewpoint , this means that we assume that the same focusing system in the shab section is continued through the following @xmath18 m - long straight section up to the apple , which is installed after the last quadrupole .
such assumption can obviously be relaxed , and it is considered here for simplicity reasons only .
also , the influence of the betatron motion on the microbunching is only estimated in the previous section , but is not explicitly accounted for in simulations . however , from previous estimations we expect that such influence would be even smaller than the influence due to the finite energy spread of the beam . moreover , as note before , the betatron function can be increased with respect to our choice , up to a value of @xmath76 m , decreasing the influence of the betatron motion on the microbunching . in this case
, a small value of @xmath58 should be organized locally at the slit position .
the power and spectrum after the apple undulator is shown in fig .
[ powapple ] and fig .
[ spapple ] .
it can be seen from these figure that our scheme is capable of providing @xmath4-gw level , @xmath77 circularly polarized radiation pulses at the fundamental harmonic of @xmath1 nm .
it is instructive to compare the output of our device with the power and spectrum , linearly polarized , from the baseline lcls undulator at saturation , fig .
[ power6 ] and fig .
[ spectrum6 ] respectively , which is comparable with the output from our setup .
enhancing the capabilities of the operating lcls baseline is a challenging problem , subject to many constraints including low cost , little available time to perform changes and guarantee of a safe return to the baseline mode of operation . in this paper
we propose a method of polarization control which offers simplicity and flexibility , and can be added to the existing lcls x - ray fel without significant cost or design changes .
the setup can be installed in a little time and is not expensive .
implementation of the proposed technique downstream of the baseline undulator will not perturb the baseline mode of operation of the lcls undulator .
moreover , at present , detailed experience is available in synchrotron radiation laboratories concerning the manufacturing of proposed apple ii undulator radiator .
an improved technology in the apple ii undulator design has been enabled in recent years in well - experienced laboratories ( consider , e.g. the development of the apple undulators for petra iii ) and this insertion device has meanwhile become commercially available , with a manufacturing time which can be estimated in two years . altogether , we offer an alternative scheme to currently available methods for polarization control which promises excellent , cost - effective , and risk - free results .
we are grateful to massimo altarelli , reinhard brinkmann , serguei molodtsov and edgar weckert for their support and their interest during the compilation of this work ." ," the lcls baseline includes a planar undulator system , which produces intense linearly polarized light in the wavelength range @xmath0-@xmath1 nm . in the soft x - ray wavelength region polarization control from linear to circular is highly desirable for studying ultrafast magnetic phenomena and material science issues . 
 several schemes using helical undulators have been discussed in the context of the lcls . 
 one consists in replacing three of the last planar undulator segments by helical ( apple iii ) ones . 
 a second proposal , the 2nd harmonic helical afterburner , is based on the use of short , crossed undulators tuned to the second harmonic . 
 this last scheme is expected to be the better one . 
 its advantages are a high ( over @xmath2 ) and stable degree of circular polarization and a low cost . 
 its disadvantage is a small output power ( @xmath3 of the power at the fundamental harmonic ) and a narrow wavelength range . 
 we propose a novel method to generate @xmath4 gw level power at the fundamental harmonic with @xmath5 degree of circular polarization from the lcls baseline . 
 its merits are low cost , simplicity and easy implementation . in the option presented here 
 , the microbunching of the planar undulator is used too . 
 after the baseline undulator , the electron beam is sent through a @xmath6 m long straight section , and subsequently passes through a short helical ( apple ii ) radiator . in this case 
 the microbunch structure is easily preserved , and intense coherent radiation is emitted in the helical radiator . 
 the background radiation from the baseline undulator can be easily suppressed by letting radiation and electron beam through horizontal and vertical slits upstream the helical radiator , where the radiation spot size is about ten times larger than the electron bunch transverse size . using thin beryllium foils for the slits the divergence of the electron beam halo will increase by coulomb scattering , 
 but the beam will propagate through the setup without electron losses . 
 the applicability of our method is not restricted to the lcls baseline setup . 
 other facilities e. g. lcls ii or the european xfel may benefit from this work as well , due to availability of sufficiently long free space at the end of undulator tunnel .    * deutsches elektronen - synchrotron *    * + *    desy 10 - 252    december 2010    @xmath7    @xmath8    * circular polarization control for the lcls baseline in the soft x - ray regime *    @xmath9    gianluca geloni ,    _ + european xfel gmbh , hamburg _    vitali kocharyan and evgeni saldin    _ + deutsches elektronen - synchrotron desy , hamburg _ @xmath8 @xmath8 issn 0418 - 9833 @xmath8    *

numerical computations in the framework of the path - integral formalism by the monte carlo method , for example in the case of lattice gauge theory , allow the study of nonperturbative effects , for example those manifesting themselves in the qcd phase transitions  @xcite .
all of these methods of field quantization are equivalent  @xcite .
the formalism of statistical mechanics agrees with the requirements of equilibrium thermodynamics , i.e. it is thermodynamically self - consistent under the condition that the thermodynamic potential of the statistical ensemble , which contains all information about the physical system , is a homogeneous function of the first order with respect to the extensive variables of state  @xcite . for most physical systems
this condition is fulfilled in the thermodynamic limit .
the problem of thermodynamic consistency in the case of lattice quantum chromodynamics ( lqcd ) , which is hoped to accurately describe the phase transitions for the relativistic quantum fields featuring in heavy ion collisions , has not been rigorously studied yet .
it is considered that the trace anomaly enhancement is the interaction measure in both the pure gauge theory on the lattice  @xcite and the full lqcd  @xcite . in the approximate numerical calculations for the lattice qcd as given , for example , in
@xcite it is difficult to verify the homogeneity properties of the thermodynamic potential of the system .
therefore , to investigate the severity of this problem , an exactly solvable statistical model for a free relativistic quantum field in the framework of path - integral quantization on a finite lattice should be reconsidered and finite volume effects as well as the continuum limit should be carefully analyzed .
the main purpose of this paper is to verify the thermodynamic self - consistency of the free neutral scalar field on the lattice and in the continuum limit in a finite volume .
the structure of the paper is as follows . in section  [ sec2 ] , we briefly describe the path - integral formalism for the neutral scalar field in the configuration and momentum spaces .
the continuum limit for the thermodynamic quantities is given in section  [ sec3 ] .
the vacuum and physical thermodynamic quantities on the finite lattice are defined in section  [ sec4 ] .
the condition of the thermodynamic self - consistency of the statistical model in the grand canonical ensemble is formulated in section  [ ap1 ] .
the results are discussed in section  [ sec5 ] .
the main conclusions are summarized in the final section .
[ sec2 ] the method of path integral quantization for the real scalar field is well known .
we propose a new algebraic method to solve the one - spatial dimensional partition function and recite the most important path integral relations to keep the paper self - contained .
we consider a system consisting only of the neutral scalar field @xmath2 with mass @xmath3 .
the corresponding classical action @xmath4 is the integral over space - time @xmath5 with the classical lagrangian density @xmath6 given by @xmath7    the thermodynamics of the real scalar field of volume @xmath1 , in contact with the heat and particle reservoir of temperature @xmath0 and chemical potential @xmath8 , is defined by the statistical operator and the partition function , @xmath9 respectively , where @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the hamiltonian of the system and @xmath12 is the electric charge operator in the canonical operator formalism . for the real scalar field the charge operator @xmath13 .
the partition function in the canonical operator formalism may be redefined in the form of the functional integral with the classical action .
this method gives another consistent description of quantum field theory  @xcite .
thus , the partition function ( [ 3 ] ) in the path integral representation can be rewritten as @xmath14 \langle\phi | e^{-\beta ( \hat{h}-\mu\hat{q } ) } |\phi\rangle.\ ] ] the field operator @xmath15 in the schrdinger picture does not depend on time @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and has the eigenstate @xmath18 with the eigenvalue @xmath19 : @xmath20 similar relations are satisfied by the canonical conjugate field operator @xmath21 .
the hamiltonian @xmath11 of the system in the schrdinger picture is expressed in terms of the field operators @xmath17 and @xmath22 as @xmath23.\end{aligned}\ ] ]
the main point of the path integral quantization method is that the `` time '' interval of continually variable length @xmath24 is subdivided into @xmath25 equal intervals of length @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and the volume @xmath1 of the system is divided into @xmath28 small cells , each with volume @xmath29 so that @xmath30 , where @xmath31
. the small intervals on the @xmath24-axis are labeled by the integer @xmath32 and the space cells in @xmath1 are fixed by the integer vector @xmath33 with the coordinates @xmath34 . the discretized @xmath24 and volume @xmath1 form a @xmath35-dimensional lattice @xmath36 , the cells of which are given by the vector @xmath37 .
then to each cell @xmath38 there is attributed the field operator @xmath39 with an eigenstate @xmath40 and eigenvalue @xmath41 .
we have a discrete set of a finite number of operators . for convenience ,
we denote the field operator in another form @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) , where @xmath44 is an integer and @xmath45 is the @xmath46-dimensional subspace of the lattice @xmath36 .    for simplicity , to start with , let us find the analytical expression for the partition function in _ one spatial dimension _ and generalize it finally to the usual three spatial dimensions .
the partition function ( [ 4 ] ) in one spatial dimension can be written as @xmath47 where @xmath48 denotes the continuum limit which means that @xmath49 at @xmath50 and @xmath51 at @xmath52 .
the exponents in eq .

the state vectors @xmath54 and @xmath55 are orthogonal and complete : @xmath56 and @xmath57 to solve eq .
( [ 7 ] ) , we insert in the left side of each @xmath58-th exponent the product of two unit operators for the fields @xmath59 and @xmath60 . using eq .
( [ 8 ] ) , we obtain @xmath61    the matrix element is @xmath62 }     \langle \pi_{i } | \phi_{i } \rangle,\ ] ] where the hamiltonian function ( [ 5b ] ) for the klein - gordon field on the lattice in one spatial dimension is given by @xmath63 note that for the real scalar field the chemical potential @xmath64 .    using the eigenstate @xmath65 in the field representation ,
the hamiltonian function for the klein - gordon field on the lattice  @xcite rewritten for one spatial dimension ( [ 10b ] ) and the ( anti)periodic boundary conditions for the field @xmath66 in the ( single ) spatial direction , we can write @xmath67,\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath68 and @xmath69 for the periodic and antiperiodic boundary conditions along the spatial @xmath70-axis , respectively . integrating over the variables @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 under the condition that @xmath74 and introducing the new variable @xmath75 with @xmath76 , we obtain @xmath77\end{aligned}\ ] ] and @xmath78 \nonumber \\    & - &   \delta_{l , k } \ [ ( 1-\delta_{i , n_{\beta}})\ \delta_{j , i+1}+(1-\delta_{j , n_{\beta}})\ \delta_{i , j+1 } ] \nonumber \\ & - & \delta_{l , k } \ [ \delta_{i,1}\delta_{j , n_{\beta}}+\delta_{i , n_{\beta}}\delta_{j,1 } ]    \nonumber \\     & - &   \delta_{i , j}\ [ ( 1-\delta_{l , n_{\sigma}})\ \delta_{k , l+1}+(1-\delta_{k , n_{\sigma}})\ \delta_{l , k+1 } ] \nonumber \\    & -&\delta_{i , j}\ \xi_{\sigma}(\delta_{l,1}\delta_{k , n_{\sigma}}+\delta_{l , n_{\sigma}}\delta_{k,1 } ) \ \frac{a_{\beta}^{2}}{a_{\sigma}^{2}},\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath79 .
the matrix @xmath80 is a symmetric square matrix .
thus , integrating ( [ 12 ] ) with respect to the variables @xmath81 , we obtain @xmath82 the determinant of the matrix @xmath80 can be calculated by the recurrence equations of the form @xmath83 where @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 .
the matrix elements @xmath88 of the matrix @xmath80 are given by eq .
( [ 13 ] ) .
let us rewrite the partition function ( [ 7 ] ) in the momentum space on the basis of the fourier transform defined on the lattice .
the four - dimensional momentum space @xmath89 , which corresponds to the lattice @xmath36 , can be defined as @xmath90 and @xmath91 where @xmath92 @xmath93 and @xmath94 @xmath95 for the choice of periodic and antiperiodic boundary conditions , respectively , along the @xmath8-direction and @xmath96 for @xmath97 even and @xmath98 for @xmath97 odd  @xcite .
it is not difficult to prove that the vectors @xmath99 and @xmath100 satisfy the following relations : @xmath101 and @xmath102 , \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath103 and @xmath104 .
then the fourier transform for the field @xmath105 on the lattice with one spatial dimension and its inverse transform can be written as @xmath106 where the index @xmath107 and the index @xmath108 .
the neutral scalar field is real and @xmath109 .
therefore , the complex function @xmath110 can be represented by its amplitude and phase in the form @xmath111 substituting eqs .
( [ 25 ] ) and ( [ 23 ] ) into ( [ 12 ] ) and using eq .
( [ 22 ] ) , we can write @xmath112\end{aligned}\ ] ] and @xmath113 \nonumber \\      & & [ \delta_{k_{x}+k'_{x}+2\theta_{x},0 } + \zeta \

\zeta & = & ( 1 - 2\theta_{x})\eta_{x}+2\theta_{x}(1-\eta_{x } ) ,      \\ \label{29 } \mathcal{j}_{ji } & = & \frac{\partial \phi_{j}}{\partial r_{i } } = \frac{1}{\sqrt{n_{\sigma}n_{\beta } } } \   e^{i [ a_{\sigma}p_{x } ( n_{x}+1)+a_{\beta}p_{\beta}(n_{\beta}+1 ) ] } , \;\;\ ; \\ \label{30 }    g_{i } & = &   a_{\beta}^{2}\left[\left(\frac{2}{a_{\beta } } \sin\frac{a_{\beta}p_{\beta}}{2}\right)^{2 } + \left(\frac{2}{a_{\sigma } } \sin\frac{a_{\sigma}p_{x}}{2}\right)^{2}\right ] \nonumber \\ & + & a_{\beta}^{2 } m^{2}.\end{aligned}\ ] ] the matrix @xmath114 is a symmetric square matrix .
thus , integrating ( [ 26 ] ) with respect to the variables @xmath115 , we obtain @xmath116 the matrix @xmath114 has @xmath117 nonzero elements equal to @xmath118 . in any row and any column
there is only one nonzero element , regardless of the periodicity conditions for the @xmath70-axis and parity conditions for @xmath119 and @xmath25 .
therefore , the determinant of the matrix @xmath114 can be written as @xmath120},\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath121 and @xmath122 .
substituting eq .
( [ 32 ] ) into eq .
( [ 31 ] ) , we obtain @xmath123 where @xmath124 and @xmath118 is the function calculated by formula ( [ 30 ] ) .
note that eq .
( [ 34 ] ) is equivalent to eq .
( [ 14 ] ) .
now the partition function ( [ 34 ] ) for one spatial dimension can be generalized to _
three spatial dimensions _ of the momentum space . for this reason
, we can rewrite the partition function ( [ 34 ] ) and the function ( [ 30 ] ) in the form @xmath125 where @xmath126 , @xmath127 and @xmath128 .
let us remark that the lattice partition function ( [ 35 ] ) for the particular case of the periodic spatial boundary conditions , @xmath129 , was firstly obtained by another method in  @xcite .
the thermodynamic quantities on the lattice are derived from the partition function ( [ 35 ] ) . the density of the thermodynamic potential @xmath130 , the energy density @xmath131
, the pressure @xmath132 , and the entropy density @xmath133 can be written as @xmath134 ,    \\
\label{38 }    \varepsilon_{e } & = & \frac{1}{\beta v}\sum\limits_{\vec{k}=k_{\sigma 1}}^{k_{\sigma 2 } } \sum\limits_{k_{\beta}=k_{\beta 1}}^{k_{\beta 2 } } \frac{\omega^{2}}{\omega_{\beta}^{2 } + \omega^{2 } } , \\
\label{39 }    p_{e } & = &   \frac{1}{3\beta v}\sum\limits_{\vec{k}=k_{\sigma 1}}^{k_{\sigma 2 } } \sum\limits_{k_{\beta}=k_{\beta 1}}^{k_{\beta 2 } } \frac{\omega^{2}-m^{2}}{\omega_{\beta}^{2 } + \omega^{2}}\end{aligned}\ ] ] and @xmath135 where @xmath136 and @xmath137 .
note that the energy density ( [ 38 ] ) and pressure ( [ 39 ] ) with the periodic spatial boundary conditions , @xmath129 , were obtained in  @xcite .
let us find the density of the thermodynamic potential ( [ 37 ] ) , the energy density ( [ 38 ] ) and the pressure ( [ 39 ] ) in the continuum limit .
here we consider only the periodic boundary conditions , @xmath129 and @xmath126 , as in ref .
@xcite . in this case
, we have @xmath138 and the functions ( [ 35a ] ) and ( [ 36 ] ) can be written as @xmath139 where @xmath140 , @xmath141 for @xmath97 even and @xmath142 , @xmath143 for @xmath97 odd , and @xmath128 .
first , let us find the thermodynamic quantities ( [ 37])([39 ] ) in the limit @xmath144 at @xmath52 and fixed value of @xmath119 .
expanding the function under the sums in eq .
( [ 38 ] ) into the series on @xmath145 around the point @xmath146 and taking the limit @xmath147 , we obtain @xmath148 from now on the asterisk symbol will denote the thermodynamic quantities given in the limit @xmath144 at @xmath149 and fixed value of @xmath119 . using the generating function ( see , for example ,  @xcite )
@xmath150 one obtains @xmath151 where @xmath152 and @xmath153 are the vacuum and physical terms , respectively , of the energy density @xmath154 . for @xmath155 , the zero - mode term @xmath156 under the sums in eqs .
( [ 38 ] ) , ( [ 42 ] ) and the zero - mode term @xmath157 under the sums in eqs .
( [ 44 ] ) , ( [ 46 ] ) are suppressed  @xcite .
the pressure ( [ 39 ] ) in the limit @xmath147 and constant value of @xmath119 can be written as @xmath158 where @xmath159 and @xmath160 are the vacuum and physical terms , respectively , of the pressure @xmath161 .
note that for @xmath155 the zero - mode term @xmath156 under the sum in eq .
( [ 39 ] ) and the zero - mode term @xmath157 in eqs .
( [ 50 ] ) and ( [ 51 ] ) are all equal to zero  @xcite .
thus , for the free massless real scalar field we have the relations @xmath162 , @xmath163 , @xmath164 and @xmath165 .
considering eqs .
( [ 44 ] ) , ( [ 49 ] ) and the definitions of the quantities ( [ 37])([39 ] ) , the density of thermodynamic potential ( [ 37 ] ) in the limit @xmath147 and fixed value of @xmath119 can be written as @xmath166 where @xmath167 and @xmath168 are the vacuum and physical terms , respectively , of the density of the thermodynamic potential @xmath169 .
note that the functions ( [ 37 ] ) , ( [ 56 ] ) and ( [ 57 ] ) in the case of the massive neutral scalar field converge at @xmath147 and constant @xmath119 .
the numerical proof of eq .
( [ 55 ] ) will be given in section  [ sec5 ] .
for @xmath155 , the zero - mode term @xmath156 in eq .
( [ 37 ] ) and the zero - mode term @xmath157 in eq .
( [ 57 ] ) are infinite .
these terms describe a condensate of massless bosons which should be excluded from the thermodynamic potentials because this condensate is an unobservable .
now let us find the thermodynamic quantities ( [ 37])([39 ] ) in the continuum limit @xmath147 , @xmath170 , @xmath171 , @xmath172 at @xmath52 and @xmath50 .
then , the energy density in the continuum limit can be rewritten as  @xcite @xmath173 where @xmath174 is the one - particle energy ( [ 41 ] ) .
it takes the form @xmath175 where @xmath176 and @xmath128 . for @xmath155 , the dispersion relation ( [ 61 ] )
is @xmath177 and the zero - mode term @xmath157 under the sum in eq .
( [ 60 ] ) is suppressed as in  @xcite . from now on the index c will denote the physical quantities given in the continuum limit .
the pressure ( [ 49 ] ) in the continuum limit can be rewritten as  @xcite @xmath178 where @xmath174 is given in eq .
( [ 61 ] ) .
note that for @xmath155 the zero - mode term @xmath157 in eqs .
( [ 63 ] ) , ( [ 64 ] ) is equal to zero  @xcite .
thus , for the free massless real scalar field in the continuum limit we have the relations @xmath179 , @xmath180 and @xmath181 .
the density of the thermodynamic potential ( [ 55])([57 ] ) in the continuum limit is given by  @xcite @xmath182 where @xmath174 is defined in eq .
( [ 61 ] ) . for @xmath155 , the zero - mode term @xmath157 in eq .
( [ 67 ] ) is infinite and should be suppressed because it is nonphysical .
thus , in the continuum limit the energy density ( [ 58])([60 ] ) , the pressure ( [ 62])([64 ] ) , and the density of the thermodynamic potential ( [ 65])([67 ] ) exactly coincide with their corresponding quantities obtained by the method of second quantization  @xcite .
hence , it was proved that for the free neutral scalar field the method of path integral quantization and the method of canonical quantization are equivalent at any values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .
let us investigate the trace anomaly and the potential inhomogeneity for the free neutral scalar field in the continuum limit .
using eqs .
( [ 60 ] ) and ( [ 64 ] ) we can write the trace anomaly in the continuum limit as @xmath183 the trace anomaly @xmath184 in the continuum limit defines the deviation of the equation of state from the stefan - boltzmann equation .
the trace anomaly ( [ tt1 ] ) for the massive neutral scalar field in a finite volume and at low temperatures is nonvanishing ; however , it decreases with @xmath0 . for @xmath155 ,
the trace anomaly ( [ tt1 ] ) is equal to zero , @xmath185 , because the zero - mode term @xmath157 in eq .
( [ tt1 ] ) was suppressed .
the potential inhomogeneity in the continuum limit can be defined as @xmath186 this quantity is a measure of violation of the homogeneous properties of the thermodynamic potential of the grand canonical ensemble .
the system in the grand canonical ensemble is thermodynamically inconsistent if the quantity ( [ pp1 ] ) is not equal to zero . for the proof of this statement see section  [ ap1 ] .    in the thermodynamic limit as @xmath187 ,
the thermodynamic quantities of the massless neutral scalar field recover their stefan - boltzmann limit , i.e. , @xmath188 , @xmath189 and  @xmath190 .
however , at finite values of volume @xmath1 and temperature @xmath0 the shift @xmath191 for the massless neutral scalar field is not equal to zero and the energy density @xmath192 deviates from its stefan - boltzmann limit .
note that the trace anomaly ( [ tt1 ] ) for the massless neutral scalar field in the stefan - boltzmann limit is zero .
[ sec4 ] we define the vacuum and physical terms of thermodynamic quantities on the finite lattice @xmath193 as in ref .  @xcite . in this case , the vacuum terms of the thermodynamic quantities on the finite lattice are derived from eqs .
( [ 37])([39 ] ) by changing the summation over @xmath194 to integration , which corresponds to @xmath195 .
thus , by definition , we have the vacuum terms as  @xcite @xmath196 ,   \\
\label{69 }     \varepsilon_{v }   & = &   \frac{1}{2v } \sum\limits_{\vec{k}=k_{\sigma 1}}^{k_{\sigma 2 } } \frac{\omega}{\sqrt{1+\left(\frac{\beta\omega}{2n_{\beta}}\right)^{2 } } } , \\
\label{70 }    p_{v } & = & \frac{1}{6v } \sum\limits_{\vec{k}=k_{\sigma 1}}^{k_{\sigma 2 } } \left(\omega-\frac{m^{2}}{\omega}\right ) \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\left(\frac{\beta\omega}{2n_{\beta}}\right)^{2}}},\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath174 is given in eq .
( [ 41 ] ) .
then , the physical terms of the thermodynamic quantities on the finite lattice can be written as  @xcite @xmath197 \nonumber \\   & - & \frac{n_{\beta}}{\beta v } \sum\limits_{\vec{k}}\ln\left[\frac{\beta\omega}{2n_{\beta}}+ \sqrt{1+\left(\frac{\beta\omega}{2n_{\beta}}\right)^{2}}\right ] , \\
\label{72 }   \varepsilon & = & \varepsilon_{e}-\varepsilon_{v } = \frac{1}{\beta v}\sum\limits_{\vec{k},k_{\beta } } \frac{\omega^{2}}{\omega_{\beta}^{2 } + \omega^{2 } } \nonumber \\   & - & \frac{1}{2v } \sum\limits_{\vec{k } } \frac{\omega}{\sqrt{1+\left(\frac{\beta\omega}{2n_{\beta}}\right)^{2 } } } , \\
\label{73 }   p & = & p_{e } - p_{v}= \frac{1}{3\beta v}\sum\limits_{\vec{k},k_{\beta } } \frac{\omega^{2}-m^{2}}{\omega_{\beta}^{2 } + \omega^{2 } } \nonumber \\             & - & \frac{1}{6v } \sum\limits_{\vec{k } } \left(\omega-\frac{m^{2}}{\omega}\right ) \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\left(\frac{\beta\omega}{2n_{\beta}}\right)^{2}}}.\end{aligned}\ ] ] these quantities are the same as those from ref .
@xcite . using eqs .
( [ 72 ] ) and ( [ 73 ] ) , we obtain the trace anomaly for the free real scalar field on the finite lattice as @xmath198 it defines the deviation of the equation of state from the stefan- boltzmann equation , @xmath199 . the trace anomaly for the free massive real scalar field on the finite lattice
is not equal to zero at the finite temperature and volume .
however , for @xmath200 the trace anomaly ( [ tt3 ] ) is equal to zero , @xmath201 .
the potential inhomogeneity for the free real scalar field on the finite lattice can be defined as @xmath202\nonumber \\ & + & \frac{\beta^{3}}{v } \sum\limits_{\vec{k},k_{\beta } } \frac{\omega^{2}-m^{2}}{\omega_{\beta}^{2 } + \omega^{2 } } -\frac{\beta^{4}}{2v } \sum\limits_{\vec{k } } \frac{\omega^{2}-m^{2}}{\omega\sqrt{1+\left(\frac{\beta\omega}{2n_{\beta}}\right)^{2 } } }   \nonumber \\    & - & \frac{3\beta^{3}n_{\beta}}{v } \sum\limits_{\vec{k } } \ln\left[\frac{\beta\omega}{2n_{\beta}}+ \sqrt{1+\left(\frac{\beta\omega}{2n_{\beta}}\right)^{2}}\right].\end{aligned}\ ] ] it defines the violation of the homogeneous properties of the thermodynamic potential for the finite values of @xmath193 .
see section  [ ap1 ] .    it should be stressed that the vacuum and physical quantities @xmath203 , @xmath204 , @xmath205 , @xmath206 and @xmath207 , @xmath208 on the finite lattice given in eqs .
( [ 68])([73 ] ) resemble the thermodynamic quantities ( [ 66 ] ) , ( [ 67 ] ) , ( [ 59 ] ) , ( [ 60 ] ) and ( [ 63 ] ) , ( [ 64 ] ) , respectively , in the continuum limit .
thus , in the continuum limit the vacuum and physical terms of the thermodynamic quantities given in ref .
@xcite exactly coincide with the same quantities obtained in the canonical quantization method .
in the equilibrium statistical mechanics all thermodynamic quantities belong to the class of homogeneous functions of the zero and first order .
this property of the thermodynamic quantities provides the fulfilment of the requirements of the equilibrium thermodynamics .
for example , in the grand canonical ensemble the zeroth law of thermodynamics is satisfied if the temperature is intensive ( zero order ) and the grand thermodynamic potential is extensive , i.e. it is a homogeneous function of the first order with respect to the extensive variable of state @xmath1 .
let us consider the case when the thermodynamic potential of the grand canonical ensemble is indeed a homogeneous function of the first order with respect to the extensive variable of state @xmath1 .
we have  @xcite @xmath209 then the pressure @xmath208 and the potential inhomogeneity @xmath210 can be written as @xmath211 and @xmath212 for the free neutral scalar field @xmath64 .
note that only in this section @xmath174 denotes the density of the thermodynamic potential of the grand canonical ensemble .    to prove the zeroth law of thermodynamics ,
let us divide the system into two subsystems ( @xmath213 and @xmath214 ) .
then the extensive variables of state of the grand canonical ensemble should be additive and the intensive variables of state should be the same  @xcite @xmath215 since the function @xmath174 in eq .
( [ y1 ] ) depends only on the intensive variables of state @xmath0 and @xmath8 then we have @xmath216 using eqs .
( [ y1 ] ) , ( [ y4 ] ) and ( [ y5 ] ) , we obtain @xmath217 thus , we have obtained that if the thermodynamic potential is a homogeneous function of the first order and the temperature is intensive , then the thermodynamic potential is an additive function and the potential inhomogeneity is zero .
this proves the zeroth law of thermodynamics for the grand canonical ensemble  @xcite .
let us consider a more general case when the thermodynamic potential of the grand canonical ensemble is an inhomogeneous function .
for example , we can write @xmath218 where @xmath219 is a real number .
for @xmath220 we have eq .  ( [ y1 ] ) .
then the pressure @xmath208 and the potential inhomogeneity @xmath221 can be written as @xmath222 and @xmath223 for the inhomogeneous thermodynamic potential ( [ y7 ] ) at @xmath224 the potential inhomogeneity @xmath225 and the pressure @xmath226 .    to verify the zeroth law of thermodynamics for the inhomogeneous thermodynamic potential ( [ y7 ] ) ,
let us divide the system into two subsystems ( 1 and 2 ) and require eq .
( [ y4 ] ) .
then we have @xmath227 using eqs .
( [ y4 ] ) , ( [ y7 ] ) and ( [ y11 ] ) , we obtain @xmath228 for @xmath224 we have @xmath229 .
thus , we have obtained that if the thermodynamic potential is an inhomogeneous function and the temperature is intensive , then the thermodynamic potential is nonadditive and the potential inhomogeneity is not equal to zero .
this means that the inhomogeneous thermodynamic potential of the grand canonical ensemble and corresponding relation @xmath226 ( @xmath225 ) violate the zeroth law of thermodynamics and thus the formalism of this statistical mechanics is thermodynamically inconsistent .
therefore , the grand canonical ensemble is thermodynamically inconsistent if the density of the thermodynamic potential is not equal to minus pressure and the potential inhomogeneity is not equal to zero .
[ sec5 ] let us study the thermodynamic properties of the real scalar field on the lattice and in the continuum limit at a finite temperature @xmath0 in some finite volume @xmath1 which are characteristic of the ultrarelativistic heavy ion and hadron - hadron collisions  @xcite .

figure  [ fig4 ] represents the density of the thermodynamic potential @xmath238 ( [ 37 ] ) , its limit @xmath169 ( [ 55 ] ) , and the shift @xmath239 as functions of @xmath25 for the free neutral scalar field on the finite lattice with the mass of @xmath231 pion at the temperature @xmath0 in some volume @xmath1 for different values of @xmath119 . for the given @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath119 , the density of the thermodynamic potential @xmath238 ( [ 37 ] ) increases with @xmath25 and attains the constant @xmath169 ( [ 55 ] ) at large values of @xmath25 .
the shift @xmath230 decreases with increasing @xmath25 and tends to zero , @xmath240 , as @xmath147 , which numerically proves that eq .
( [ 55 ] ) contains only two terms : the vacuum term @xmath167 and the physical term @xmath168 .
the quantities @xmath238 and @xmath169 increase with @xmath119 .
thus , in the continuum limit , the density of the thermodynamic potential @xmath238 and @xmath169 tend to infinity , but the shift @xmath230 is equal to zero . in the continuum limit

( [ 65 ] ) .
thus , contrary , for example , to ref .
@xcite , the density of thermodynamic potential ( [ 65 ] ) for the free neutral scalar field in the continuum limit does not contain any infinite constant . the thermodynamic potential ( [ 65 ] )
is composed of the vacuum and physical terms only .
let us investigate the thermodynamic self - consistency of the free massive neutral scalar field on the finite lattice .
the formalism of statistical mechanics in the grand canonical ensemble agrees with the requirements of equilibrium thermodynamics if the thermodynamic potential of the grand canonical ensemble is a homogeneous function of the first order with respect to the extensive variable of state , the volume @xmath1 .
this means that the density of the physical thermodynamic potential @xmath204 ( [ 71 ] ) and the physical pressure @xmath208 ( [ 73 ] ) should fulfill the equation , @xmath241 , for any values of the variables of state @xmath0 and @xmath1 , i.e. , the potential inhomogeneity @xmath221 ( [ pp3 ] ) should be equal to zero  @xcite .

this function vanishes as @xmath244 .
thus , the lattice physical energy density ( [ 72 ] ) does not recover the stefan - boltzmann energy density @xmath245 at high temperatures .
the second maximum of the function @xmath243 moves toward to higher temperatures with @xmath119 and the values of the function @xmath243 at the intermediate points between these two maxima tend to their stefan - boltzmann limit as @xmath170 .
the same behavior is clearly seen for the lattice physical thermodynamic potential @xmath246 .
however , the lattice physical pressure @xmath247 has only one maximum at high temperatures and does not recover its stefan - boltzmann limit .
the lattice trace anomaly @xmath248 has a maximum at low temperature and vanishes with increasing @xmath0 .
however , the lattice potential inhomogeneity @xmath249 is an oscillating function of @xmath0 and it is not equal to zero for those values of @xmath0 for which the energy density and pressure are nonvanishing functions .
thus , as the lattice potential inhomogeneity @xmath221 is not equal to zero , the statistical formalism for the free massive neutral scalar field on the lattice is thermodynamically inconsistent for all values of the temperature @xmath0 at fixed values of @xmath25 , @xmath119 and volume @xmath1 .

the same behavior is seen also for the lattice physical thermodynamic potential @xmath251 .
the lattice physical pressure @xmath252 increases with @xmath1 , reaches a maximum and then drops to zero in the limit @xmath187 .
the lattice trace anomaly @xmath254 and the lattice potential inhomogeneity @xmath255 increase infinitely as @xmath253 .
the trace anomaly @xmath256 on the lattice is not equal to zero for all values of @xmath1 for which the lattice physical energy density and the lattice physical pressure are nonvanishing functions . for large values of volume
@xmath257 @xmath234 the potential inhomogeneity @xmath221 on the lattice is not equal to zero also for all values of @xmath1 for which the lattice physical thermodynamic potential and the lattice physical pressure are nonvanishing functions .
thus , as the lattice potential inhomogeneity @xmath221 is not equal to zero , the statistical formalism for the free massive neutral scalar field on the finite lattice is thermodynamically inconsistent for all values of the volume @xmath1 including the thermodynamic limit . in the thermodynamic limit the physical pressure ( [ 73 ] ) and the density of the physical thermodynamic potential ( [ 71 ] ) on the finite lattice vanish .

@xmath0 this function decreases and tends to zero as @xmath244 .
the appearance of the maximum in the trace anomaly in the continuum limit at low temperatures @xmath0 is independent of the presence of the maximum in the energy density . for both @xmath242 @xmath234 and @xmath261 @xmath234 ,
the potential inhomogeneity @xmath270 in the continuum limit has a maximum .

with growing volume towards @xmath273 @xmath234 the physical energy density @xmath192 , the physical thermodynamic potential @xmath265 and the physical pressure @xmath266 in the continuum limit reach their values in the thermodynamic limit , which are different from the values of the stefan - boltzmann limit .

the potential inhomogeneity @xmath274 for the free massive neutral scalar field in the continuum limit decreases with @xmath1 and vanishes in the thermodynamic limit as @xmath187 .
thus , the nonzero values of the potential inhomogeneity @xmath271 at finite values of @xmath1 indicate that for fixed values of @xmath0 the statistical formalism in the continuum limit is thermodynamically self - consistent only in the thermodynamic limit @xmath187 .        in the continuum limit the thermodynamic inconsistency @xmath276 of the system at low temperatures @xmath0 and small values of volume @xmath1
may be explained by the fact that in the volume @xmath1 the system contains less than one particle on average , @xmath277 .
see the lower panels of figs .
[ fig7 ] and [ fig8 ] .
thus , the thermodynamic inconsistency of the system at low temperatures @xmath0 and small values of volume @xmath1 is an artifact of the grand canonical ensemble because in the grand canonical ensemble the term with the zero number of particles also contributes to the partition function .
note that for the free real scalar field there is no conserved current .
however , the number of neutral particles can be accounted by the eigenvalues of the number operator @xmath278 the definition of this operator for the free real scalar field can be found , for example , in  @xcite .
the mean number of particles in the continuum limit @xmath272 corresponds , namely , to the statistical average of this number operator @xmath279 and has the meaning of the average number of neutral bosons in the volume @xmath1 at temperature @xmath0  @xcite . with growing volume @xmath1 and temperature @xmath0 the mean number of particles in the continuum limit @xmath272 increases and the system described in the continuum limit becomes thermodynamically self - consistent , i.e. , @xmath280 .
in a finite volume the momentum operator of particles has the discrete eigenvalues .
see eqs .
( [ 18 ] ) and ( [ 61 ] ) .
not all values of momentum of particles are allowed . in the volume
@xmath1 the gap between the allowed values of the momentum of particles is @xmath281 .
figure  [ fig9 ] represents the volume dependence of the gap of momentum @xmath282 in the range of @xmath1 characteristic for the ultrarelativistic heavy ion and hadron - hadron collisions . from figs .
[ fig7 ] , [ fig8 ] and [ fig9 ] it is clearly seen that the free real scalar field is thermodynamically inconsistent @xmath276 for those values of @xmath1 at which the momentum gap @xmath282 is approximately the same or larger than the temperature @xmath0 of the system .
we may conclude that the quantized momenta of particles in a small volume @xmath1 and at finite temperature @xmath0 lead to the thermodynamic inconsistency of the free real scalar field in the grand canonical ensemble .

"the study of interplay of noise and nonlinear dynamics presents many challenges in systems under non equilibrium conditions .
these systems exhibit wide variety of novel physical outcomes(simple to complex ) .
a nonequilibrium system is one in which there is a net energy flow from external sources .
many different models employing stochastic processes in physics , chemistry , engineering and biological sciences have lead to discovery of several noise induced phenomena in systems far away from equilibrium .
prominent examples are noise induced phase transitions , stochastic resonance , resonant activation , noise induced stability of unstable states , noise induced unidirectional transport of particles in the absence of obvious bias ( thermal ratchets or theory of molecular motors ) , noise induced ordering ranging from separation of different materials into heterogeneous final state to the formation of a rich variety of regular patterns , self organization , etc[1 - 8 ] . the list is not exhaustive by any means . in all these phenomena mentioned above noise
plays an active role ( active noise paradigm ) .
noise or fluctuations arise either because of the coupling of system to an external unknown system or from the thermal bath .
the presence of noise can alter the behaviour of system in a fundamental way - a change that has nothing to do with the sensitive dependence of initial conditions as in the chaotic systems .
in contrast to the general notion that noise is undesirable and destructive , in many nonequilibrium systems it plays a constructive and stabilizing role in the dynamics .
the most of the phenomena mentioned above exist only in the presence of noise , i.e. , they can not be observed in the absence of noise .
hence noise acts as a generator of order as opposed to generator of disorder .
even when the magnitude of noise is small , the probability of the macrostate depends on the details of the global kinetics and can not be determined by the macrostate alone . in other words the stability criteria which examine only the immediate vicinity of a locally stable state are inadequate to assess the relative stability of states in a nonequilibrium system .
the kinetics of unstable intermediate state even as these are rarely populated can have a dramatic effect on the relative stability of states .
this leads to the notion of local versus global stability criteria that will be discussed in the following sections .    in the present work
we will be mainly concerned with the nature of directed motion induced by the random noise in inhomogeneous systems in the absence of bias .
the noise induced active transport in a fluctuating environment arises from so - called ratchet mechanism[7 - 24 ] . here
, nonequilibrium fluctuations combined with spatial or temporal anisotropy conspire to generate systematic motion even in the absence of any net bias .
it should be noted that in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics usable work can not be extracted if only equilibrium fluctuations are present . in thermal equilibrium
the principle of detailed balance prohibits net particle current in any system .
in contrast , in a nonequilibrium situation , where the detailed balance is lost , net current flow is possible , i.e. , one can extract energy by rectifying fluctuations or at the expense of overall increased entropy .
the problem of rectification at brownian scale was posed much earlier by smoluchowski[25 ] and feynman[26 ] .
a major motivation for these studies(stimulating interaction between biology and physics ) comes from the plausible theoretical arguments for the motion of molecular kinesin[1,7,8,11 ] .
the kinesin molecule belongs to a class of proteins known as motor molecules .
these molecules which include dyneins and myosin move along the structural filaments such as microtubules , microfilaments .
the motor molecules are used for the transportation of organnelles(cargo , chemicals ) for intra cellular transport and muscle contraction or to power muscles .
the energy source for these molecules comes from hydrolysis of atp . in atp energy
is stored in the phosphate bonds , this energy is released when the bond is hydrolyzed and adp is produced .
the motor proteins use this energy to bring about unidirectional motion along the biopolymers . here
chemical energy is converted into mechanical energy .
the fluctuations in the potentials experienced by the motors are believed to arise from the binding and dissociation of atp , and the anisotropic periodic potential as representing the electrostatic potential along the long structural filament . in these systems
it is known that there is no known gradient of chemical concentration or the temperature , to determine the direction of the movement .
moreover , it is also clear that the motion of these motors can be described as a over damped motion of a brownian particles . at any time
the velocity @xmath0 of the particle is proportional to the force @xmath1 on the particle .
these particles experience random kicks from the surrounding medium and the average thermal energy of a particle is @xmath2 .
this energy @xmath2 is comparable to the other involved energy scales in the problem , such as the barrier heights .
hence brownian motion plays an essential role in the action of motors .
thus , protein motors operate in a brownian regime where inertia is negligible and thermal fluctuations are important .    with a primary motivation to explain the unidirectional motion of molecular motors the subject of noise induced transport has gone beyond the biological realm . in physics , area of thermal ratchets are being explored to investigate new methods for controlled devices of high resolution for particle separation[27 ] .
these devices are expected to be superior to existing methods such as electrophoretic method for particles of micrometer scale , like cells , latex spheres , dna or proteins . for this
the current reversal phenomenon is one of the most interesting aspect of the theory of brownian ratchets , i.e. , magnitude and the direction of the brownian particles are very sensitive to their masses .
new questions regarding the nature of heat engines ( reversible and irreversible ) at atomic or molecular scales , their energetics , and the efficiency of the energy conversion are being studied[28 ] . in brownian heat engines
one would also like to understand the possible sources of irreversibility and whether the irreversibility can be suppressed such that the efficiency approaches that of a carnot cycle .    the collection of large number of interacting brownian particles exhibit cooperative effects .
interactions can lead to dynamical phase transitions and instabilities that characterise the behaviour of motor collections .
it turns out that cooperative motors can generate a directed force even if the system is symmetric[29 ] .
the direction of motion of a symmetric system is selected by spontaneous symmetry breaking . in symmetric case , the transition is isomorphous to a paramagnet - ferromagnet transition , in the asymmetric case to a liquid - vapor transition . in some special cases
the coupled systems display amazing features when exposed to an externally applied force .
the most prominent being a zero - bias negative conductance and anomalous hysteresis[30 ] , which are completely new collective phenomena . in game theory based on
the theory of brownian ratchets , new area of paradoxical gambling games have emerged under the subject of parronodo s paradoxes[31 ] . here , two losing ( with probability one ) gambling games , when combined or played in a random sequence , can lead to a winning game with probability one !
it has also been suggested that mobility - induced transport can be used as a concept of possibilities to think about social and financial systems that are so often out of equilibrium[32 ] .
ratchet devices based on quantum processes have been proposed . using quantum dots these devices
have been investigated experimentally .
net currents due to quantum coherent motion of electrons have been observed even when the applied ac voltage is zero on average .
strikingly the direction of the current is reversed as a function of temperature , exhibiting quantum to classical cross over , the phenomenon is of fundamental importance in the foundations of quantum mechanics[33 - 34 ] .
several qualitatively different physical models for noise induced transport have been proposed , namely , rocking ratchets , flashing ratchets , diffusion ratchets , correlation ratchets , frictional ratchets , etc . for this
we refer the readers to an excellent recent review by reimann[8 ] .
most of these studies are restricted to non - interacting particles . in this article
we confine to the physics in inhomogeneous medium where brownian particles experience the friction coefficient and/or temperature to be non uniform in space . we find out a model with minimal conditions that the inhomogeneous system assisted by fluctuating forces must satisfy in order to obtain unidirectional current . for this
we develop a self consistent approach based on microscopic treatment[24,35 ] . in the process
we discuss about thermal and frictional ratchets that are of current interest . in these inhomogeneous systems
we show that directed current can be obtained even in spatially periodic symmetric potentials . the inversion symmetry in these systems being broken dynamically by the space dependent frictional coefficient or temperature inhomogeneity .
several other conditions to obtain noise induced transport can be relaxed in regard to the nature of external noise and their statistics as compared to non frictional ratchets .
we explain the possibility of obtaining current reversals even in the adiabatic regime of rocked frictional ratchets as a function of system parameters[36,37 ] . in a non - adiabatic regime
multiple current reversals can be observed[38 ] .
following the treatment of stochastic energetics we discuss the efficiency of the energy transduction and give conditions under which noise can facilitate the energy conversion .
nature of system inhomogeneity plays important role in deciding the nonequilibrium and kinetic properties of the system .
most of the systems that one comes across in nature are inhomogeneous .
these inhomogeneities could be structural , configurational , entropic , temperature non - uniformities , etc .
brownian motion in confined geometries or in porous media show space dependent friction[39 ] .
particles diffusing close to surface have a space dependent friction coefficient[39,40 ] .
it is believed that molecular motor proteins move close along the periodic structure of microtubules and therefore experience a position dependent mobility[32 ] .
frictional inhomogeneities are common in super lattice structures and in semiconductor systems[20 ] . in josephson junctions periodically varying frictional coefficient corresponds to the term representing interference between the quasiparticle tunneling and the cooper pair tunneling[41 ] .
nonuniformity in temperature can have important consequences on the particle motion , for instance , the kinetics of growth of crystalline nuclei in the melt around its critical size .
the latent heat generation being , in this example , responsible for the creation of nonuniform temperature field across the surface of the nucleus .
one can have inhomogeneous temperature field because of nonuniform distribution of phonons and electrons(or of quasiparticles in general ) with different characteristic temperatures in the solid[22 ] .
temperature inhomogeneities can also be induced by external pumping of noise in the system .
we would like to emphasize and show explicitly later that the variations in space dependent friction does not alter the equilibrium properties of the system , however , affects the dynamics of the system in a nontrivial way .
the relative stability of the competing states is generally governed by the usual boltzmann factor . in the presence of nonuniform temperature
the relative stability of two states is sensitive to detailed kinetics all along the pathways ( on the potential surface between the two states under comparison ) .
we reason in the present work that system inhomogeneity may provide a clear and unifying framework to approach the problem of macroscopic motion under discussion .
the existing popular models,[8 - 19 ] currently in the literature , mostly take the nonequilibrium fluctuations to be non - gaussian white ( colored ) noise together with a ratchetlike periodic potential to aid unidirectional motion of an overdamped brownian particle .
the ratchetlike periodic system potentials @xmath3 , obviously violate parity @xmath4 .
for such potentials one can readily calculate steady current flow @xmath5 of a brownian particle in the presence of an external field @xmath1 .
it turns out that @xmath5 is not an odd function of @xmath1 and in general , @xmath6 in the regime of nonlinear response .
in other words , reversal of the external force may not lead to a reversed current of the same magnitude in sharp contrast to the case of a nonratchetlike ( symmetric ) periodic potential system where @xmath5= @xmath7 follows . from this general observation , in a ratchetlike potential , it can be easily concluded that on application of a zero time averaged periodic field , say @xmath1=@xmath8 , one can obtain net unidirectional current .
thus ratchet may also be described as a nonlinear rectifier .
the currents exhibit maxima both as a function of the forcing amplitude as well as temperature .
when the forcing amplitude is small the motion is determined by the thermal activation rates ( kramer s time scales ) or overcoming the barriers to the left and right .
jump rates being asymmetric , we obtain a finite average drift velocity for nonzero forcing term .
the average velocity is quite small at low temperatures due to the arrehenius prefactor . at intermediate temperature ,
the jumps are more frequent and at high temperatures , jumps in both direction are of equal likelihood and the magnitude of the net current falls .
for this reason we observe a maxima in current at finite temperature .
this is the basic physics behind some of the physical models ( known as rocked ratchet ) used to obtain current rectification in a periodic potential system .
there are models , however , that do not use oscillating external fields . instead , colored noise of zero average strength-dichotomous , ornstein - uhlenbeck , kangaroo processes, ... [11 - 13 ] , is used to drive the brownian particle to obtain macroscopic motion in a ratchetlike potential system .
we would like to emphasize that in rocked ratchet it is possible to obtain unidirectional current even in the absence of thermal noise , i.e. , in the deterministic limit when the potential is asymmetric and the amplitude of the rocking force can be such that tilt in one direction can destroy all energy barriers allowing the particle to slide down ( running state ) .
however , they still have barriers when the potential is tilted by the same amount in the opposite direction and hence preventing the particle motion in the opposite direction . in this deterministic limit ,
motion exhibit intriguing structures as the function of forcing amplitude , such as current quantization and phase locking behaviour[38 ] .
inclusion of inertial effect allows the possibility of having both regular and chaotic dynamics .
this deterministically induced chaos can mimic the role of noise .
the system exhibits multiple current reversals with respect to the forcing amplitude . however , all these effects are not robust in the presence of noise .
there are further interesting models where the potential barriers themselves are allowed to fluctuate ( flashing ratchet ) , for instance , with finite time correlations between two states under the influence of a noise source[8,11 ] .
an example being an overdamped brownian particle subjected to a ratchetlike periodic potential , where the asymmetric saw - tooth potential ( in which two edges of the teeth make different angles with the vertical ) is switched on to its full strength for time @xmath9 during which the brownian particle slides down the potential slope to the bottom of the potential minima ( fixed point ) . at the end of @xmath9 , the system is put in the other ( @xmath10 ) state during which the potential is set equal to a constant ( say = 0 , simplest case ) for an interval @xmath11 and the particle executes free diffusive motion . at the end of @xmath11 the system
is put back in the @xmath12 state for interval @xmath9 . this process of flipping of states is repeated ad - infinitum .
if @xmath11 is adjusted in such a way that by the end of @xmath11 the diffusive motion just takes the particle out of the ( now nonexistent ) potential minima in the steeper slope direction ( smaller distance , say in right direction ) of the saw - tooth potential but fails to do so in the gentler slope direction ( larger distance ) , the immediate next @xmath12 interval will take the particle to the adjacent minimum in the steeper slope side of the saw - tooth potential .
repetition of such sequential flipping of states for a large number of times lead to a net unidirectional macroscopic current ( in the right direction ) of the brownian particle .
it should be noted that a symmetrical nonratchetlike potential(fluctuating between two states ) would , instead , have yielded symmetrical excursions of the brownian particle and , hence , no net unidirectional motion . in this mechanism to obtain net current of the brownian particle the system is supplied with the required energy externally to flip the system between the two states keeping the interval @xmath9 and @xmath11 fixed ( thus the system is in a nonequilibrium state ) .
there is a lot of freedom to play around with the parameters @xmath9 , @xmath11 , the saw tooth potential , and the thermal noise strength . and
a judicious tuning of these parameters could even result in the reversal of the current .
the flipping process could , however , be effected also by a finite time - correlated fluctuating dichotomous force .
it should be noted that the former flipping process of definite @xmath9 and @xmath11 have been practically exploited in the particle separation techniques , whereas the latter fluctuating flipping time process has some appeal to natural processes .
the diversity of the models just does not end here . unlike rocking ratchets ( deterministic limit with high amplitude of rocking ) , thermal fluctuations are essential to get net unidirectional motion in all models of flashing ratchets .
interestingly in all these flashing ratchet models particle need not climb the barrier , it only has to slide down the potential slope .
there have been attempts too to obtain macroscopic current with gaussian white noise under nonratchetlike symmetric periodic potential field as well but subjected to temporally asymmetric periodic external fields [ 16 - 18 ] .
we do not attempt here , however , to give a review of the models considered .
we present , in the following , a framework to obtain macroscopic motion in an inhomogeneous system with space dependent friction coefficient and nonuniform temperature fields restricting ourselves to periodic potential systems .    in all the models
just mentioned [ 8 ] ( the list is not exhaustive . ) the system was taken to be homogeneous as far as the question of diffusivity was concerned . however , in some of the works , earlier to the ones alluded to so far , the nonuniformity of the diffusion constant of the system was considered to yield macroscopic transport [ 20 - 21 ] .
the diffusion coefficient could be space dependent or state dependent and so the system may dissipate energy during its time evolution differently at different space points . unlike homogeneous systems , however , the physics of inhomogeneous systems has not been free from controversies[21,44 ] , such as , whether the equation    = ,    or + @xmath13     + should be the correct form of diffusion equation .
nevertheless , such controversies apart , b@xmath14ttiker [ 20 ] and also van kampen [ 21 ] have shown that one can expect macroscopic transport of a brownian particle in a periodic potential field when the diffusion coefficient is also periodic with the same periodicity but shifted by a phase difference other than 0 and @xmath15 with respect to the periodic potential field .
it should be noted that the potential field is not required to be ratchetlike .
the system is rendered nonequilibrium by diffusion coefficient inhomogeneity in the system and the `` stationary state '' of the system is no longer governed by the usual boltzmann factor . in the theory , one needs to go beyond the phenomenological description .    in reference [ 35 ] , a microscopic treatment is given for the derivation of the macroscopic equations of motion in an inhomogeneous medium ( space dependent friction coefficient and spatially nonuniform temperature ) starting from a microscopic hamiltonian of the system in contact with ( phonon ) heat bath(s ) .
moreover , a proper overdamped limit of the langevin equation of motion in such an inhomogeneous medium is derived .
a correct form of the corresponding fokker - planck equation is obtained and it is explicitly shown that neither of the two forms of the diffusion equation mentioned above [ eq.(1 ) ] is correct . from this macroscopic equation of motion one obtains an expression for the average current which depends on the details of the potential field and the inhomogeneities of the system .    as mentioned earlier
, the nonuniformity of diffusion coefficient can arise either because of the space dependence of the friction coefficient @xmath16 or that of the temperature @xmath17 or because of both[40.44 ] .
we , however , discuss possibilities of macroscopic current flow as a result of various kind of inhomogeneities in a symmetric periodic potential system .
the first case we consider is when @xmath16 and @xmath17 are space dependent . by taking @xmath16 and
@xmath17 periodic one gets a tilt in the potential field throughout the sample as discussed phenomenologically in ref.[20 ] , resulting in a macroscopic current because of thermal fluctuations . in this case
the temperature inhomogeneity is crucial and one can obtain current even when the friction coefficient becomes uniform .
friction coefficient inhomogeneity alone , however , does not generate macroscopic current . in the second case
, we consider a thermal particle in a system with space dependent friction coefficient but subjected to external white noise fluctuations , and in the third case a thermal particle subjected to external space dependent white noise is considered .
we then discuss the case of a brownian particle coupled to two thermal baths .
it should be noted , however , that in all the cases that we have considered do not require the potential to be ratchetlike nor do we require the fluctuating forces to be correlated in time to obtain macroscopic current .
finally we discuss the noise induced currents , their efficiency and the phenomenon of multiple current reversals in rocked frictional ratchets .
in section 2 we provide a derivation of the macroscopic equation of motion in an inhomogeneous system from a microscopic hamiltonian of a brownian particle interacting with a ( phonon ) heat bath .
we , then , obtain proper smoluchowski equation from the derived langevin equation of motion following the prescription of sancho et al [ 45 ] .
we use , in sec.3 , this overdamped equation of motion in an inhomogeneous system with space dependent friction coefficient and nonuniform temperature field to obtain nonzero macroscopic current . in the same section
we elaborate three other possible cases of inhomogeneous systems where macroscopic current could be possible .
the section 4 is devoted to ac driven frictional ratchets and 5 for discussions .
we consider an inhomogeneous system where the inhomogeneity could arise either because of the space dependence of friction coefficient , or the nonuniformity of the temperature field or because of the combined effect of both .
the effect of the nonuniformity of temperature or temperature gradient , however , can not be incorporated as a potential term in the hamiltonian formalism in sharp contrast to , for instance , the amenability of incorporation of electric field gradient in the hamiltonian of a charged particle .
we , therefore , incorporate the effect of temperature inhomogeneity at the end directly into the equation of motion obtained from the microscopic hamiltonian suited to take care of the space dependence of the friction coefficient .
we consider a ( subsystem ) brownian particle , of mass @xmath18 , described by a coordinate @xmath19 and momentum @xmath20 moving in a potential field @xmath21 of the system and being in contact with a thermal(phonon ) bath .
the bath oscillators are described by coordinates @xmath22 , momenta @xmath23 and mass @xmath24 with characteristic frequencies @xmath25 .
we consider the total hamiltonian[35 ] @xmath26,\ ] ] the interaction of the subsystem with the thermal bath is through the linear ( in @xmath27 ) coupling term @xmath28 . from
( 2 ) one obtains the following equations of motion .    q = ,    p = - v^(q)+ _ _ a^(q ) ,    q= ,    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the derivative of @xmath31 with respect to @xmath19 . after solving ( 3c ) and ( 3d ) for @xmath32 by using the method of laplace transform and substituting its value in ( 3b ) ,
we obtain    q = ,    @xmath33 + a^{\prime}(q ) \sum_{\alpha } \frac{a(q_0 ) \lambda^{2}_{\alpha } } { m_\alpha \omega^{2}_\alpha } \cos(\omega_\alpha t ) .
\yesnumber\end{aligned}\ ] ]    here @xmath34 is the initial value of the particle co - ordinate @xmath19 and @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the initial co - ordinates and velocities , respectively , of the bath variables .
the second term in the right hand side of equation ( 4b ) depends on the momenta at all times previous to @xmath37 . at this stage markovian limit
is imposed so that @xmath38 the equation ( 5 ) follows readily from the well known ohmic spectral density distribution for the bath oscillators , i.e. , @xmath39 where @xmath40 is an upper cutoff frequency set by the oscillator spectrum of the thermal bath . the markovian approximation ( 5 )
has the effect of neglecting the transient terms involving the initial coordinate @xmath34 , in the equation of motion , for long time behaviour [ 46 ] .
in other words , the equation should well describe the motion of the brownian particle in time scales @xmath41 @xmath42 .
the equation of motion thus assumes the form    q = ,    @xmath43 ^ 2{p } + a^{\prime}(q)\ f(t),\ ] ]    where @xmath44.\ ] ] the force @xmath45 is fluctuating in character because of the associated uncertainties in the initial conditions @xmath46 and @xmath47 of the bath variables .
however , as the thermal bath is characterised by its temperature @xmath48 , the equilibrium distribution @xmath49 of bath variables is given by the boltzmannian form @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the partition function .
using equation ( 8a ) and ( 6 ) one can easily compute the statistical properties of the fluctuating force @xmath45 .
it is gaussian with    f(t ) = 0 ,    and +    f(t)f(t^ ) = k_bt  g(t - t^ ) = 2k_bt(t - t^ ) .
it should be noted that the effect of the interaction term @xmath28 in the hamiltonian ( 2 ) is to introduce a friction term and a fluctuating term @xmath45 in the equation of motion ( 7b ) .
moreover , @xmath30=constant corresponds to a uniform friction coefficient .
we redefine , @xmath52 ^ 2}\eta = \eta(q)$ ] and @xmath53 , and put @xmath54 , in ( 7 ) to obtain ,    q = p ,    p = - v^(q ) - ( q)p + f(t ) ,    with    f(t ) = 0 ,    and +    = 2 ( t - t^ ) .    from eqs.(9 )
it follows that the derived langevin equation of motion ( 10b ) of a brownian particle , in a system with space dependent friction @xmath55 but at constant uniform temperature @xmath48 , is internally consistent and obeys fluctuation - dissipation theorem .
we now proceed to incorporate the effect of space dependence of temperature , in a thermally nonuniform system , into the langevin equation of motion by assuming that the brownian particle comes in contact with a continuous sequence of independent temperature baths as its coordinate @xmath27 changes in time .
( for notational simplicity , we replace the coordinate @xmath19 and momenta @xmath20 by the corresponding lower case letters @xmath27 and @xmath56 , respectively , reserving @xmath20 for probability distribution . )
we consider each space point @xmath27 of the system to be in equilibrium with a thermal bath characterised by temperature @xmath17 .
also , it should be noted that one could take @xmath16 to be constant piecewise along @xmath27 , and in each piece of these @xmath27 segments eq.(10b ) would correspond to an equation of motion with the constant friction coefficient but with the same statistical character of @xmath45 ( 11a-11b ) in all @xmath27 intervals .
let us discretise the system , for the sake of argument , into segments @xmath57 around @xmath27 and represent them by indices @xmath58 .
let us further assume that each segment is connected to an independent thermal bath at temperature @xmath59 with corresponding random forces @xmath60 so that the equation of motion ( 10b ) , in the segment @xmath58 , will have the last term @xmath61 . as the two different segments @xmath58 and @xmath62 are each coupled to an independent temperature bath we have @xmath63 .
because @xmath45 is @xmath64 correlated in time , as the particle evolves dynamically the fluctuation force @xmath60 experienced by the brownian particle while in the space segment @xmath58 at time @xmath37 will have no memory about the fluctuating force experienced by it at some previous time @xmath65 while in the space segment @xmath66 .
the space - dependent index @xmath58 in @xmath60 , therefore , can be ignored and the equation of motion becomes local in time as well as in space .
therefore , in the continuum limit , the stochastic equations of motion of the brownian particle , in an inhomogeneous medium with space dependent friction and nonuniform temperature , acquire the simple forms    q = p ,    p = - v^(q ) - ( q)p + f(t ) ,    with    f(t)f(t^ ) = 2 ( t - t^ ) .      from eq.(12b )
one can readily write down the fokker - planck equation or the kramer s equation for the full probability distribution @xmath67 . however , in most of the practical situations the marginal probability distribution @xmath68 for the variable @xmath27 alone suffices to describe the motion of the brownian particle .
this probability distribution @xmath68 can be obtained in the overdamped limit of the langevin equation ( 12b ) which is valid on time scales larger than the inverse friction @xmath69 .
in other words in the overdamped case the fast variable , velocity @xmath0 , is eliminated from the equation of motion . in the case of homogeneous systems
one simply puts @xmath70 in eq.(12b ) to obtain the overdamped langevin equation .
however , in case of inhomogeneous systems , the above method of adiabatic elimination of fast variables does not work , and leads to unphysical equilibrium distribution .
the proper prescription for the elimination of fast variables has been given in ref.[45 ] for systems with space dependent friction .
the method retains all terms upto order @xmath69 and the resulting overdamped langevin equation yields physically valid equilibrium distribution .
we , therefore , apply the same prescription to obtain the overdamped langevin equation of motion in an inhomogeneous system with space dependent friction @xmath16 and nonuniform temperature field @xmath17 .
we obtain , @xmath71}^2 } \left[t(q ) \eta^{\prime}(q ) + \eta(q)t^{\prime}(q ) \right ] +   \sqrt { \frac{k_{b}t(q)}{\eta(q)}}f(t),\ ] ] with + @xmath72 using van kampen lemma[47 ] and the novikov s theorem[48 ] we obtain the corresponding fokker - planck equation as @xmath73.\ ] ] eq.(15 ) is the smoluchowski equation for an overdamped brownian particle moving in an inhomogeneous system with space dependent friction and nonuniform temperature .
it should be noted that eq.(15 ) gives the correct form of diffusion equation instead of either of the two forms mentioned in eqs.(1 ) .
it is clear that the temperature and the friction coefficients influence the particle motion in a qualitatively different fashion and they can not be plugged together to get effective diffusion coefficient to satisfy either of the forms of eq.(1 ) . in the next section we discuss how the system inhomogeneity can help maintain a macroscopic unidirectional current .
we consider inhomogeneous systems where the inhomogeneity could be an internal property of the system or it could be imposed externally . as mentioned earlier we consider four cases where macroscopic motion can be obtained .
when the system is bounded at @xmath74 , i.e. , @xmath75 as @xmath74 , the system attains steady ( stationary ) state with zero probability current .
in such a situation , we can calculate the steady state probability distribution @xmath76 , from the smoluchowski equation ( 15 ) , by setting the probability current @xmath77\ ] ] equal to zero , as @xmath78 where + @xmath79 + and _
n _ is a normalization constant .
it is very clear from the expression , eq.(18 ) , for @xmath80 ( effective or generalized potential ) that the peaks of @xmath76 are determined not by the minima of @xmath81 alone but are determined as a combined effect with @xmath82 .
@xmath76 may even peak at positions which would be quite less likely to be populated in the stationary situations for uniform temperature , @xmath82 = @xmath48 condition . in this respect ,
nonequilibrium situations appear strange .
it is quite common in biological systems where , for example , otherwise less likely ion channels are , in some situations , found to be more active for ionic transport .
recently such nonequilibrium behaviour in biological systems have been theoretically attributed to the effect of nonequilibrium fluctuations and the process has been termed as kinetic focusing[49 ] .
moreover , it should be noted that the relative stability of two states of a system with nonuniform temperature field is not determined by the local function @xmath3 but by the entire pathway through a continuous sequence of intervening states between the two states under comparison .
the temperature variation may modify the kinetics of these intervening states drastically and hence their contribution towards the relative stability will be substantial even when they are sparsely populated .
for example , application of a localized heating at a point on the reaction coordinate lying between the lower energy minimum and potential energy barrier maximum can raise the relative population of the higher - lying energy minimum over that of a lower minimum given by usual boltzmann factor .
it should further be noted that @xmath83 is not determined by @xmath16 as it should be .
moreover , the functional form of @xmath83 is similar to @xmath84 , of course , in this case @xmath85 has been augmented by a compensating force k@xmath86 .
@xmath87 $ ] is the drift velocity and d(q ) = @xmath88 is the effective diffusion coefficient .
so far we have not assigned any functional form to @xmath89 and @xmath16 . in ref.[20 ] it is shown that at least in one case the system can generate nonzero probability current , namely , when both @xmath3 and @xmath90 are periodic with same periodicity but having a phase difference other than 0 and @xmath15 . in our present problem if we assume @xmath3 , @xmath17 and @xmath16 to be periodic functions with periodicity , say , @xmath91 then the probability current is given by [ 20 ] @xmath92 where @xmath93 determines the effective slope of a generalized potential @xmath83 and hence @xmath64 being @xmath94 or @xmath95ve determines the direction of current .
it is obvious from the expression for @xmath64 that the phase difference @xmath96 , between @xmath3 and @xmath17 , alone determines the direction of current .
the net unidirectional current remains nonzero ( finite ) except when @xmath96 is an integral multiple of @xmath15 ( @xmath97 corresponds to zero effective slope of the generalized potential ) .
it should further be noted that the amplitude of variation of @xmath16 does not determine the direction of current but does affect the magnitude of current . a periodic variation of @xmath16 and @xmath3 but uniform @xmath17 will yield no unidirectional current .
for @xmath98 and @xmath99 , with @xmath100 ( for positive temperature ) @xmath64 turns out to be @xmath101 $ ] which is definitely nonzero for @xmath102 , @xmath103 , ....... thus @xmath96 alone determines the direction of nonzero current @xmath104 . in this case
the periodic variation of temperature plays the crucial role and may yield current even when @xmath105 = constant .
the dependence of current on @xmath96 alone can readily be observed from the fact that the effective potential @xmath106 shows a tilt(or finite slope ) in positive or in negative direction depending on the magnitude of @xmath96 .
the transport arises because particles starting from the potential minima can climb the hot slope more easily than they can climb the cold slope , created by phase difference between the potential and temperature profile .
thus transition rates from one value to another in the right direction is different from that in the left direction(@xmath96 breaks the symmetry between left and right transition rates ) .
we consider another simple case for which @xmath107 , @xmath108 , with @xmath109 and space independent friction with magnitude @xmath110 .
for this simple case effective potential @xmath111-(\alpha/2)\sin(\phi)q)/t_{0}$ ] , where the last term clearly shows tilt responsible for the current .
the magnitude of current is given by the eqn .
( 19 ) with @xmath112 .
current is zero for @xmath113 and for @xmath114 .
direction of current depends on @xmath96 . in fig .
[ butt ] we have plotted dimensionless current @xmath62 versus @xmath115 the average value of the temperature field over the spatial period for various values of @xmath116 . here temperature is in a dimensionless form and is scaled with respect to barrier heights .
other parameters are given in the figure caption .
interestingly the current increases with @xmath115 starting from @xmath117 at @xmath118 and saturates to a constant value at high @xmath115 limit .
this saturation in the high temperature limit is specific to this model . in the inset
we have shown the variation of current @xmath62 with @xmath96 for various values of @xmath115 .
it may be noted again that the direction of current is determined solely by @xmath96 . for further analalysis and graphical presentation of the effective potential
we refer to [ 20 ] .
we now consider cases , where @xmath16 plays a decisive role .      unlike the case considered in subsection 3.1 , where the overdamped brownian particle experiences a fixed ( in time ) local ( nonuniform ) temperature profile @xmath17 during its sojourn @xmath119 for all @xmath37 , we consider , in this subsection , a system with uniform temperature @xmath120 but a spatially varying @xmath16 .
the langevin equation of motion is given by @xmath121 and the corresponding overdamped equation is @xmath122 ^ 2 } + \sqrt{\frac{k_{b}t}{\eta(q ) } } f(t),\ ] ] with @xmath123 and @xmath124 we , now , subject the system to an external parametric additive white noise fluctuating force @xmath125 , so that the equation of motion becomes @xmath122 ^ 2 } + \sqrt{\frac{k_{b}t}{\eta(q ) } } f(t ) + \xi(t),\ ] ] with @xmath126 @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the strength of the external white noise @xmath125 .
we can immediately write down the corresponding fokker - planck ( smoluchowski ) equation @xmath129.\ ] ] for periodic functions @xmath3 and @xmath16 , with periodicity @xmath91 , one obtains unidirectional current following earlier procedure using equation ( 23 ) .
the resulting expression for current @xmath104 takes the same functional form as given in eq.(19 ) where @xmath83 is now given by @xmath130 and the effective diffusion coefficient + @xmath131 with @xmath132 + for v(q ) = @xmath133 and @xmath134 , @xmath64 turns out to be equal to @xmath135.$ ] as earlier the direction of current is determined by the phase difference @xmath96 between the periodic functions @xmath3 and @xmath16 .
it is important to notice that there is no way one could obtain macroscopic current in the absence of the external white noise @xmath125 .
this case , however , is similar in essence to the previous case of nonuniform temperature . in the present situation the overdamped brownian particle is subjected to an external parametric random noise .
the noise being externally imposed , the system always absorbs energy ( without the presence of corresponding loss factor ) [ 50 ] .
also , the overdamped particle moves slowly wherever the friction coefficient @xmath16 is large and the possibility of absorption of energy from the external white noise at those elements @xmath27 of the system , therefore , is correspondingly large .
thus , the effective temperature @xmath17 of the system is given by @xmath136 , which modulates as @xmath16 varies and hence the macroscopic current results as in the case 3.1 .
the overdamped langevin equation is , @xmath137 with @xmath138 = 0 and @xmath139 = 2 @xmath140 .
eq.(26 ) obeys fluctuation - dissipation theorem and hence in the absence of any external bias potential there can be no net current irrespective of the form of the periodic potential @xmath3 .
we now subject the system to an external multiplicative gaussian white noise fluctuation .
the corresponding overdamped langevin equation is given by    q = - + f(t ) + g(q ) ( t ) ,    where @xmath141 is an arbitrary function of @xmath27 and @xmath125 is a white noise with @xmath126 and @xmath142 + the associated fokker - planck equation can be immediately written down as @xmath143 now , if we assume @xmath3 and @xmath141 to be periodic functions with periodicity @xmath91 , the net unidirectional current can be obtained and is given by eq.(19 ) , with @xmath144 and the effective diffusion coefficient , @xmath145 for the specific form of the periodic functions @xmath146 and + @xmath147 we obtain , @xmath148 .\ ] ] the phase @xmath96 being + ve or -ve determines the sign of @xmath64 and consequently direction of the current @xmath104 ( eq.(19 ) ) .
it should be noted that , as in case 3.2 , the overdamped brownian particle experiences an effective space dependent temperature @xmath149^{2}$ ] .
the first case ( 3.1 ) corresponds to a system which is intrinsically nonequilibrium and requires an internal mechanism such as the generation of latent heat at the interface in first order transitions to maintain the temperature profile @xmath17 .
the other two cases ( 3.2 and 3.3 ) are , however , supplied with energy externally via the externally applied white noise . and
finally , we consider a case where the brownian particle is subjected to two thermal baths .
we now consider the situation in which the system is in contact with an additive thermal noise bath at temperature @xmath48 and a multiplicative thermal noise bath at temperature @xmath150 .
the corresponding equation of motion of the brownian particle can be derived from a microscopic hamiltonian and is given by [ 22 ] @xmath151 @xmath152 and @xmath153 are two independent gaussian white noise fluctuating forces with statistics ,    _
a(t ) = 0 ,    _
a(t^ ) = 2_ak_bt(t - t^ ) ,    and +    _ b(t ) = 0 ,    @xmath154    where , @xmath48 and @xmath155 are temperatures of the two baths a and b , respectively .
it should be noted that , @xmath152 and @xmath153 represent internal fluctuations and together satisfy the fluctuation - dissipation theorem @xmath156 .
the bath b is associated with a space dependent friction coefficient @xmath157 .
when the two temperatures @xmath48 and @xmath150 become equal the system will be in equilibrium and no net current can flow . by making @xmath48 and @xmath150 different the system
is rendered nonequilibrium and one can extract energy at the expense of increased entropy .
the system , thus , acts as a maxwells - demon type information engine which extracts work by rectifying internal fluctuations . in ref .
[ 22 ] an expression for current is obtained in the overdamped limit .
the overdamped limit of the langevin equation is taken by setting the left hand side of eq.(30 ) equal to zero .
this procedure of obtaining overdamped limit is not correct as explained in section 1 .
following the procedure of ref.[45 ] the correct fokker - planck equation in the overdamped limit is given by [ 23 ] @xmath158^{2 } } { p } \right\}.\end{aligned}\ ] ] for periodic functions @xmath3 and @xmath157 with periodicity @xmath91 the noise induced transport current @xmath104 is given by eq.(19 ) , where , now @xmath159 and @xmath160 and @xmath161    as in earlier cases , taking specific periodic forms of @xmath162 and @xmath163 , the exponent @xmath64 in eq.(19 ) for current is obtained as @xmath164\ ] ] it is clear from the expression for @xmath64 that , again as in earlier cases ( 3.1 - 3.3 ) , the phase difference @xmath96 between @xmath3 and @xmath157 determines the direction of current @xmath104 . it is to be noted that , the current will flow in one direction if @xmath165 @xmath150 and will flow in the opposite if @xmath166 for given @xmath96
thus , the system acts like a carnot engine which extracts work by making use of two thermal baths at different temperatures ( @xmath167 ) .
moreover @xmath64 vanishes when @xmath157 becomes space independent constant @xmath168 , i.e. , when @xmath113 , and the current @xmath104 becomes zero .
it should be noted further that when the amplitudes of @xmath157 and @xmath169 are small compared to the amplitude of @xmath3 , the problem turns out to be equivalent to a particle moving in a spatially varying temperature field , @xmath17=@xmath170 and , as discussed in section 3.1 , such a nonuniform temperature field yields net unidirectional current .
having shown that the average unidirectional motion is possible in a periodic system subjected to an external * white noise fluctuations * , we now turn our attention to rectification affect in inhomogeneous systems driven by ac force as opposed to white noise fluctuations .
these ratchets are called as rocked frictional ratchets .
we study phenomena of currents , their reversals and efficiency of energy transduction in these systems .
we obtain separately results both in adiabatic ( low frequency limit ) and in nonadiabatic limit of external driving .
we show that in adiabatic limit , when the potential is symmetric efficiency can me maximised as the function of noise strength or temperature .
however in the case of asymmetric potential , temperature may or may not facilitate the energy conversion . for this case current reversal can also be obtained in the adiabatic limit as the function of temperature and the amplitude of the periodic drive . in the nonadiabatic limit by properly tuning the parameter
the system exhibits multiple current reversals , both as a function of thermal noise strength and as a function of rocking force .
current reversals also occur under deterministic conditions and exhibits intriguing structures .
these results are due to mutual interplay between potential asymmetry , noise , driving frequency and inhomogeneous friction .      in this subsection
we study the motion of an over - damped brownian particle in a potential @xmath3 subjected to a space dependent friction coefficient @xmath171 and an external force field @xmath172 at temperature @xmath48 .
the motion is described by the langevin equation [ 24,35 - 38 ] @xmath173^{2 } } + \sqrt{\frac{k_{b}t}{\eta        ( q ) } } \xi ( t ) , \ ] ] where @xmath174 is a randomly fluctuating gaussian white noise with zero mean and correlation , i.e. , @xmath175 .
we take @xmath176 . for generality
we take @xmath177 to be asymmetric periodic potential , @xmath178 , where @xmath179 is the asymmetry parameter and @xmath180 being any natural integer .
@xmath181 is a constant force ( load ) representing the slope of the washboard potential against which the work is done . also , we take the friction coefficient @xmath171 to be periodic : @xmath182 , where @xmath96 is the phase difference with respect to @xmath177 .
the equation of motion is equivalently given by the fokker - planck equation @xmath183 .\ ] ] this equation can be solved for the probability current @xmath62 when @xmath184 = constant , and is given by [ 51 - 53 ] @xmath185 it may be noted that even for @xmath186 may not be equal to @xmath187 for @xmath188 .
this leads to the rectification of current ( or unidirectional current ) in the presence of an applied ac field @xmath189 .
we assume @xmath189 changes slowly enough , i.e , its frequency is smaller than any other frequency related to relaxation rate in the problem . for a field @xmath189 of a square wave amplitude @xmath190 ,
an average current over the period of oscillation is given by , @xmath191 $ ] .
this particle current can even flow against the applied load @xmath181 and thereby store energy in a useful form . in the quasi - static limit following the method of stochastic energetics
it can be shown [ 54 - 56 ] that the input energy @xmath192 ( per unit time ) and the work @xmath193 ( per unit time ) that the ratchet system extracts from the external noise are given by @xmath194 = \frac{1}{t_{f}-t_{i } } \int_{x = x(t_{i})}^{x = x(t_{f } ) } f(t ) dx(t)$ ] and @xmath195 $ ] . as defined earlier
@xmath196 is the total potential including the load .
the efficiency of the energy transformation is given by @xmath197 .
for the square wave of amplitude @xmath190 we get @xmath198 $ ] and @xmath199 $ ] respectively . thus the efficiency ( @xmath200 ) of the system to transform the external fluctuation to useful work
is given by @xmath201}{a[j(a ) - j(-a)]}.\ ] ] for details we refer to [ 54,55 ] . before proceeding further we would like to emphasize that from eqn .
( 32 ) , one can obtain the mobility of the particle in a periodic potential tilted by a constant external field moving in a inhomogeneous media .
the mobility is given by current divided by constant external field and is a nonlinear function of external field . unlike the constant friction coefficient case , where the mobility monotonically increases and saturates to a constant value ,
here the mobility shows stochastic resonance ( sr ) and asymptotically saturates to the previous constant value .
the occurrence of sr in the absence of weak periodic signal is indeed a new phenomena[51 - 52 ] , which essentially reduces the constraints for the observability of sr[4,5 ] .
besides sr , the mobility also shows resonance like phenomena as a function of external applied force and noise induced stability of states ( mobility decreases as a function of noise strength ) .
the noise induced stability is yet another counterintuitive novel concept aided by the presence of noise[6,52 ] .
this phenomena is also related to the delay of decay of unstable states by enhancing the strength of thermal noise .
we shall first discuss the effect of inhomogeneity in a symmetric potential ( i.e when @xmath202 ) and under adiabatic conditions and then proceed to show in the next subsection how asymmetry and finite frequency drive brings about a qualitative change in the current characteristics .
it is found , numerically , that the effect of @xmath203 , the amplitude of periodic modulation of @xmath16 , for instance on @xmath204 is more pronounced for larger value of @xmath205 .
we choose @xmath206 throughout our work .
contrary to the homogeneous friction case where the net current goes to zero , the detailed analysis of the eqn .
( [ curr ] ) shows that the net current @xmath204 quickly saturates monotonically to a value equal to @xmath207 as a function of @xmath190 irrespective of the value of temperature @xmath48 .
all the interesting features are captured at smaller values of @xmath190 itself .
we shall confine ourselves to @xmath208 , the threshold value at which the barrier of the potential @xmath209 just disappears ( in this regime the deterministic motion is in the locked state ) .
in this case as mentioned earlier it is a phase lag @xmath96 creates spatial asymmetry responsible for currents , @xmath96 determines the direction of asymmetry of the ratchet . for @xmath210
, we have a forward moving ratchet ( current flowing in the positive direction ) and for @xmath211 we have the opposite , in the presence of external quasi - static force @xmath189 . when the system is homogeneous ( @xmath212 ) , @xmath213 for @xmath214 and for all values of @xmath190 and @xmath48 , because the potential @xmath3 is symmetric
. however , when @xmath215 for all @xmath188 .
fig.([compare_curr ] ) clearly illustrates this . in fig.([compare_curr ] ) we have plotted @xmath204 ( in dimensionless units ) for various values of @xmath96 at @xmath216 as a function of temperature @xmath48 ( in dimensionless units ) .
henceforth all our variables like @xmath217 are in dimensionless units [ 53 ] .
the inset shows the behaviour of @xmath204 with temperature for various @xmath190 when @xmath218 .
we have chosen @xmath219 ( corresponding to a positive mean slope of @xmath3 ) .
one would expect , for @xmath212 , @xmath220 for all values of @xmath190 and @xmath221 due to the presence of load or biasing field in the negative direction .
fig.([compare_curr ] ) shows that @xmath222 for all values of @xmath96 ( the net current being up against the mean slope of @xmath3 ) . though the result is counterintuitive , but it is still understandable .
for @xmath223 the particle is expected to have acquired higher mean velocity before it hits the large @xmath16 region and hence faces maximum resistive force and therefore though @xmath223 is negative it is small in magnitude compared to @xmath224 , where the particle faces just the reverse situation . the average current @xmath225 exhibits maximum as a function of temperature ( sr like phenomena ) .
at large value of temperature , @xmath226 becomes negative .
in this regime of high temperature the ratchet effect disappears and the current which is negative is in response to the load .
the peaking behaviour of @xmath204 as a function of @xmath48 is due to the synergetic effect of the thermal fluctuations and the space dependent friction coefficient @xmath16 . of course ,
this result is obtained in the quasi - static limit when the time scale of variation of @xmath189 is much larger compared to any other relevant time scales involved in the system .
fig.([compare_effi ] ) shows the efficiency @xmath200 of flow of current against the load ( slope ) @xmath181 .
the parameter values chosen for figs.([compare_curr ] and [ compare_effi ] ) are same .
_ @xmath200 shows a maximum as a function of temperature_. this implies that thermal noise can facilitate energy conversion by ratchet system . in the adiabatically rocked ratchet
this can be seen only in the presence of space dependent friction .
it is to be noted that the temperature corresponding to maximum efficiency is not close to the temperature at which the current @xmath204 is maximum . from this
we can conclude that _ the condition of maximum current does not correspond to maximum efficiency of current generation .
_ this fact has been pointed out earlier but in a different system [ 55 ] .    in fig.([0_load ] ) we have plotted the average current @xmath227 in the absence of load as function of temperature for various values of @xmath190 for given @xmath218 .
it shows that in the absence of load @xmath181 , @xmath204 never changes sign from positive to negative .
we now turn our attention to asymmetric potentials .
it is possible to get a current reversal as a function of temperature if , instead of a symmetric potential one considers an asymmetric potential @xmath228 ( where @xmath179 lies between 0 and 1 , describes an asymmetry parameter ) [ 57 ] . in fig.([curr_rev ] ) we have plotted @xmath227 in the absence of load as function of temperature with asymmetry parameter @xmath229 . in fig.([curr_rev ] ) we notice that the current reverses its direction as function of temperature or noise strength . here too the current reversal phenomena is solely due to the space dependent friction . in the large temperature regime ( compared to the barrier energies )
the current due to space dependent friction dominates and hence current does not depend on the asymmetry parameter @xmath179 .
we have chosen @xmath96 such that in the high temperature limit current is negative . even in the absence of spatial inhomogeneity asymmetric
potential exhibits current . in our case
this current is in positive direction and dominates in the low temperature regime even after the inclusion of inhomogeneities .
thus going from the low temperature to the high temperature regime we have current reversal .
thus current reversal can be obtained by properly tuning the system parameters . in homogeneous systems
( but asymmetric potential ) current reversal is possible when the frequency of the field swept @xmath189 is large[10,58 ] ( nonadiabatic regime ) .    in the presence of spatial asymmetry efficiency
exhibits a complex behaviour . depending on the system behaviour efficiency can monotonically decrease as a function of temperature or
it can show a peaking behaviour . thus thermal fluctuations need not facilitate the energy conversion[36 - 37 ] .
this is in contrast to the behaviour in the presence of symmetric potential , where the efficiency always exhibits a peaking behaviour as a function of the strength of thermal noise .      in this subsection
we discuss the phenomena of current reversals in nonadiabatic regime in some detail . for finite frequency drive ,
the probability current density @xmath104(x , t ) is given by + @xmath230p(x , t ) ,   \label{current}\ ] ] where @xmath231 ( @xmath232 being the period of the forcing term ) .
since the potential and the driving force have spatial and temporal periodicity respectively , therefore @xmath233 , [ 10,53 ] . the net current @xmath62 in the system
is given by @xmath234 .
@xmath62 is independent of the initial phase @xmath235 of the driving force .
we solve the fpe numerically by the method of finite difference and calculate the current @xmath62[38 ] .    in the fig .
( [ lam=0]a ) , the average current @xmath62 is plotted as a function of temperature @xmath48 for different values of @xmath236 . here
the asymmetry parameter @xmath237 and @xmath238 . in this case
the current reverses its sign ( only _ once _ ) for frequencies sufficiently large as shown in the @xmath239 case .
these frequencies corresponds to nonadiabatic regime [ 10 ] and are larger than intrawell relaxation frequency @xmath240 .
current in the adiabatic limit can be obtained analytically[36 - 37 ] . in the absence of asymmetric potential and presence of space
dependent friction ( @xmath206 ) , there is no current reversal irrespective of @xmath236 and phase shift @xmath96 as shown in fig  ( [ lam=0]b ) .
hence asymmetric potential is essential for current reversal .
however , the direction of the current depends on the phase lag @xmath96 . separately in both these cases absolute value of current exhibits a maxima as a function of @xmath48 , reminiscent of sr . in the absence of space dependent friction fig .
( 6a ) , for frequencies higher than intrawell frequency @xmath241 , the low temperature scenario is governed by interplay between potential asymmetry and @xmath236 . due to higher frequency
the brownian particles do not get enough time to cross the barriers .
most of the particles move about the potential minima .
the probability of finding the brownian particles near the minima increases with increasing frequency , consequently the probable number of particles near the potential barrier decreases .
since the distance from a potential minima to the basin of attraction of next minima is less from steeper side ( which is at left side of the minima ) than from the slanted side , hence in one period the particles get enough time to climb the potential barrier from the steeper side than from the slanted side , resulting in a negative current . on increasing the temperature , the particles get kick of larger intensity and hence they easily cross the slanted barrier , resulting in a current reversal and positive current .
now we study the combined effect of spatial asymmetry and frictional inhomogeneity in the nonadiabatic regime . in fig .
( 7a ) we have plotted @xmath62 _ vs _ @xmath48 with @xmath242 , @xmath243 and @xmath244 for different values of @xmath236 . in the presence of finite frequency drive
there are two current reversals as shown in the figure ( for the case of @xmath245 ) .
this phenomena of twice current reversal with temperature @xmath48 is the foremost feature in our model , previously unseen in any overdamped system . in this case
@xmath96 has been chosen in such a manner so that current in the high temperature limit ( which is predominantly determined by frictional inhomogeneity than spatial asymmetry ) is opposite to pure spatially asymmetric case ( @xmath246 ) .
this is the cause of second current reversal as seen for the @xmath247 case . the first current reversal being the effect of finite frequency driving and spatial asymmetry as discussed earlier . when the phase difference @xmath96 is such that the current due to space dependent friction alone is in the same direction as that of current due to potential asymmetry only , then we do not have current reversal in the adiabatic case as shown in fig  ( [ j - t]b ) where @xmath248 , though a _ single
_ current reversal due to finite frequency drive may be present .
in all the cases studied so far we have observed that the current reversal do not take place above a critical frequency @xmath249 of driving , which in turn depends sensitively on @xmath96 and other parameters in the problem .
multiple current reversals can also be seen when the amplitude ( @xmath190 ) of the forcing term is varied in a suitable parameter regime of our system . in fig .
[ j - a ] , the plot of @xmath62 versus @xmath190 is shown for different values of @xmath236 , keeping @xmath203 , @xmath96 and @xmath48 fixed at @xmath250 , @xmath251 and @xmath252 respectively . for @xmath245 curve
, we can see as many as four current reversals .
for very large value of @xmath190 , the current asymptotically goes to a constant value @xmath253 , as was previously shown for the adiabatic case .
it should be noted that in the same asymptotic regime current goes to zero in the absence of space dependent friction . as the asymptotic value of current depends on @xmath96 ,
so we can choose it appropriately to make it positive or negative .
in the present case , @xmath96 has been chosen such that the asymptotic current is negative which guarantees at least one current reversal irrespective of frequency .
the oscillatory behaviour in the @xmath254 characteristics is the reminiscent of deterministic dynamics .
the inset in fig .
[ j - a ] shows current reversal even for the deterministic case also .
in addition it exhibits the interesting phenomena of current quantization and phase locking .
this current quantization give rise to oscillatory behaviour due to broadening of the steps in presence of small thermal noise . on further increasing the temperature
these oscillatory behaviour vanishes .    in fig  ( [ j - a2 ] )
we have plotted @xmath62 versus @xmath190 for @xmath255 for various values of @xmath236 .
there is no current reversal in the adiabatic regime . here
@xmath96 has been chosen such that , the asymptotic current is in the same direction as that due to the spatial asymmetry of the potential ( i.e positive ) .
hence no multiple current reversal can be seen in the nonadiabatic regime even though there is oscillatory behaviour .
the only reversal at low value of @xmath190 is that of finite frequency drive as discussed previously .
the observation of multiple current reversals can be attributed to a cooperative interplay between the spatial asymmetry of the potential , the friction inhomogeneity and the finite frequency drive .
depending on the system parameters we may have multiple current reversal or no current reversal at all ( see fig .
(  [ j - a ] and [ j - a2 ] ) ) .
all the above results can be understood qualitatively .
transport in a nonequilibrium periodic system has become , in recent times , a field of very active research .
we have just tried , in the beginning of this work , only to enumerate various working ideas to build a plausible model of thermal ratchet .
the brief enumeration is , of course , not complete .
the models are being gradually refined and simplified to be close either to the experimental reality or to invent techniques to be useful in practice .
transport in inhomogeneous nonequilibrium systems has attracted attention since long .
we have presented in sec.2 a microscopic approach to obtain macroscopic equation of motion in such systems .    with the help of these equations in sec .
3.1 we have considered a medium with space dependent temperature and friction and have discussed the origin of unidirectional current in these systems . in the situations considered , in sections 3.1 and 3.2 , the system is subjected to external white noise fluctuations violating the fluctuation - dissipation theorem . also , these two cases , in a sense , are physically equivalent to having a spatially varying temperature field as considered in section 3.1 . in section 3.4
we have considered an inhomogeneous system under the action two thermal baths
. this system acts like a carnot engine which extracts work by making use of two thermal baths being at different temperature .
this model too in the limit of small friction field modulation amplitude corresponds to a spatially varying temperature field .
these observations seem to suggest that the case of inhomogeneous systems with spatially varying temperature field provides a general paradigm to obtain macroscopic current and several variants considered to model fluctuation induced transport may fall in the same general class of problems as considered in section 3.1 . moreover in all our models to obtain unidirectional current we require external white noise fluctuations as opposed to various models for homogeneous systems where application of colored noise ( correlated noise ) is must . for example , earlier models of thermal ratchets driven by colored noise in a small correlation time expansion ( or in the unified colored noise approximation for arbitrary time ) become identical to a brownian particle moving in an inhomogeneous medium with space dependent diffusion coefficient [ 59 ] .
the interesting idea of relative stability of states , which affects current , in the presence of temperature nonuniformity which is central to our treatment , however , has not received the attention it deserves in the area of nonequilibrium thermodynamics .
we remark that we do not require the periodic potential field of the system to be ratchetlike nor do we require the fluctuating force to be a colored noise to obtain macroscopic current .
thus we have put the problem of macroscopic unidirectional motion in nonequilibrium systems on a more general footing .    in sec .
4 we have discussed the current rectification and their reversals in ac driven frictional ratchet both in adiabatic and in nonadiabatic regime . both spatially symmetric and asymmetric
potential has been considered .
we observe several novel and complex features arising due to the combined effect of asymmetry and inhomogeneous friction and finite frequency driving force .
currents in the low temperature regime is mostly influenced by the asymmetry of the potential . at higher temperatures
it is controlled by the modulation parameter @xmath203 of the friction coefficient .
we find current reversal with temperature even when the forcing is adiabatic . in the presence of finite frequency ,
twice current reversal occurs . as function of amplitude of the forcing term
we observe multiple current reversals .
current even reverses its sign in the adiabatic deterministic regime and exhibits intriguing feature like phase locking and current quantization .
current reversals in ratchets are very sensitive to the nature of potential and system parameters .
even the condition of current direction can not be readily predicted a priori .
ratchets of different kind ( and there are as many as discussed by reimann [ 8 ] ) require different conditions for current reversals , which have been worked out in some limiting cases [ 8 ] . however , all ratchets exhibit great sensitivity to the form of underlying potential and its derivatives over the entire period ( see the introduction of [ 8 ] ) .
for example , it has recently been shown [ 60 ] that by barrier subdivision of potential profile with an integer n number of modulations ( in a randomly rocked ratchet ) can lead to n-1 current reversals as a function of temperature . however , there is no universal rule to obtain current reversal .
we expect that our analysis should be applicable for the motion of particle in porous media and for molecular motors where space dependent friction can arise due to the confinement of particles .
we have briefly discussed the efficiency of energy conversion in these systems in the adiabatic limit .
we have shown that efficiency for energy transduction can be maximised as a function of noise strength and temperature .
this in itself is a interesting observation .
however , in the case of asymmetric potential the temperature may or may not facilitate the energy conversion .
some of our recent studies reveal that in nonadiabatic limit , efficiency of the system may be small or large compared to the adiabatic regime .
this indicates that by going away from the quasi - static limit(adiabatic limit ) efficiency can be increased contrary to the behaviour for reversible engines . for heat engines at molecular levels(molecular motors )
the generalisation of thermodynamic principles to nonequilibrium steady states is a subject of current interest[61 ] . in a recent work[32 ]
it has been shown that in two state ratchet models(flashing ratchets ) mobility can take over the role of the potential .
contrary to previous models even no microscopic forces(or potentials ) are involved in the transport mechanism .
we further expect that several novel cooperative effects and quantum effects discussed in the introduction for homogeneous systems may lead to a rich variety of phenomenon in inhomogeneous systems .
system inhomogeneities may further enhance our understanding of non - debye relaxation ( approach to equilibrium ) even in the absence of potential disorder .
to conclude we expect that the further studies of dynamics of particles in inhomogeneous non equilibrium systems may lead to new concepts in thermodynamics and statistical physics .

 there are many physical models proposed to accomplish this nonequilibrium effect . in the present work we consider inhomogeneous systems so that the friction coefficient and/or temperature could vary in space . 
 we find out a model with minimal conditions that the inhomogeneous system assisted by fluctuating forces must satisfy , in order to obtain unidirectional current . in the process 
 we discuss about thermal and frictional ratchets that are of current interest .

"laser cooling of atoms or molecules relies on the repeated excitation and spontaneous emission of light  @xcite . when the atom or molecule reaches a dark state , i.e. , a state that does not interact with the laser light , it escapes from the cooling cycle .
if this occurs before the particle is sufficiently cooled , repumping is required .
the presence of too many levels that act as dark states has prevented laser cooling to work for most molecular species .
however , dark states can also be used to an advantage in laser cooling when they are populated only by the cooled particles .
this is utilized for example in subrecoil cooling based on velocity selective coherent population trapping  @xcite .
dark states also play a crucial role in the laser cooling of internal degrees of freedom  @xcite .
the presence of many internal levels requires a broadband optical excitation which can be realized by femtosecond laser pulses .
cooling occurs if the target level is populated by spontaneous emission but remains dark to the laser pulse  @xcite .
the dark state can be realized by destructive interference or simply by removing the frequency components corresponding to excitation of the target level .
the latter has recently been realized experimentally , resulting in successful demonstration of laser cooling of vibrations  @xcite .
an extension to cooling rotations is feasible as well  @xcite .
electronic states employed for the vibrational cooling by optimized optical pumping and spontaneous emission .
the vibrational ground state ( red solid curve ) is the target state of the optimization , vibrationally excited states ( shown here @xmath0 ) make up the initial incoherent ensemble . ]    in the experiments of refs .
@xcite , cooling the internal degrees of freedom by broadband optical pumping was preceded by standard laser cooling of atoms to temperatures of the order of 100@xmath1k and then photoassociating the atoms into weakly bound excited state molecules .
photoassociation  @xcite is followed by spontaneous emission , yielding molecules in the ground electronic state .
depending on the choice of excited state potential , a significant part of the molecules might end up in ground state levels with comparatively small vibrational quantum numbers  @xcite .
these molecules can be laser cooled by broadband optical pumping as illustrated in fig .
[ fig : pots_cooling ] : an incoherent ensemble of molecules in different vibrational levels of the electronic ground state is excited by a broadband laser pulse to an electronically excited state .
the electronically excited molecules will decay by spontaneous emission back to the ground state .
the branching ratio for the different ground state vibrational levels is determined by the franck - condon factors or , more precisely , transition matrix elements , between ground and excited state levels .
some decay will always lead to the ground vibrational level .
repeated broadband optical pumping then accumulates the molecules in the ground vibrational level  @xcite .
the overall cooling rate is determined by the timescale of the dissipative step , i.e. , the spontaneous emission lifetime  @xcite .
it can not be modified by the coherent interaction of the molecules with the laser pulse .
however , the pulses can be shaped such as to populate those excited state levels which preferentially decay into the target level .
here we show that this minimizes the number of required optical pumping cycles .
moreover , we demonstrate that optimal pulse shapes allow for cooling even in cases where the franck - condon map is preferential to heating rather than cooling .
this is the case when the excited state levels show similar einstein coefficients for many ground state vibrational levels . rather than accumulating the molecules in a single target level ,
spontaneous emission then distributes the population incoherently over many levels , effectively heating the molecules up .
we employ optimal control theory to calculate the pulse shapes . instead of treating the full dissipative dynamics of the excitation / spontaneous emission cycle , we take advantage of the timescale separation between the coherent interaction of the molecules with the laser pulse , on the order of 10@xmath2ps , and the spontaneous decay with excited state lifetimes of the order of 10@xmath2ns . seeking a pulse that populates those excited state levels with the largest einstein coefficients with the target ground state level
allows us to treat the decay implicitly .
we formulate two optimization functionals that are independent of the specific initial state .
thus we obtain an optimized pulse shape that remains unchanged over the complete cooling process consisting of many repeated excitation / spontaneous emission cycles .
the two optimization functionals realize different cooling mechanisms : one is based on optical pumping from all thermally populated ground state levels symmetrically , whereas the other one forces the thermally populated ground state levels into an assembly line. only the first level in the line is transferred to the excited state while population from all other levels is reshuffled , one after the other into the first level , via raman transitions . this suppresses heating actively and allows us to answer the question of what is the fundamental requirement of the molecular structure to allow for cooling .
our paper is organized as follows .

[ sec : concl ] .
we consider cs@xmath3 and lics molecules in their electronic ground state after photoassociation and subsequent spontaneous emission . the excited state for optical pumping
is chosen to be the @xmath4 state as in the experiment for cs@xmath3 molecules of refs .
this state is comparatively isolated such that population leakage to other electronic states due to e.g. spin - orbit interaction is minimal .
the hamiltonian describing the interaction of the molecules with shaped femtosecond laser pulses in the rotating - wave approximation reads @xmath5 where @xmath6 denotes the vibrational kinetic energy . @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the potential energy curves as a function of interatomic separation , @xmath9 , of the electronic ground and excited state ( note that for cs@xmath3 the @xmath10 state is of gerade symmetry and the @xmath11 state of ungerade symmetry ) .
@xmath12 is the transition dipole moment , approximated here to be independent of @xmath9 .
the laser pulse is characterized by its carrier frequency , @xmath13 , and complex shape , @xmath14 , with the time - dependent phase @xmath15 referenced to the phase of the carrier frequency .
the potential energy curves are found in refs .
@xcite and @xcite for the electronic ground state and in refs .
@xcite and @xcite for the electronically excited state of cs@xmath3 and lics , respectively .
the decay of the excited state molecules back to the electronic ground state is described by the spontaneous emission rates , @xmath16 the einstein coefficients @xmath17 are determined by the franck - condon factors , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the hnl - london factor equal to @xmath20 for @xmath21 and equal to @xmath22 for @xmath23 , @xmath24 denotes the fine structure constant and @xmath25 the electron charge . @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the rovibrational eigenstates of the @xmath28 electronic ground state and the @xmath29 excited state , respectively .

a compact parabola of large transition matrix elements is observed for cs@xmath3 , cf .
left - hand side of fig .
[ fig : fcf ] .
excitation at the right edge of this parabola can simply be ensured by removing part of the broadband spectrum  @xcite .
spontaneous emission then will occur to levels with @xmath33 , and repeated cycles of broadband excitation and spontaneous emission results in vibrational cooling  @xcite .
the situation changes completely for lics , cf .
right - hand side of fig .
[ fig : fcf ] .
there is no compact boundary separating large from small transition matrix elements , and a given excited state level has many non - zero transition matrix elements of similar magnitude .
spontaneous emission will thus spread the population , and even worse , will do so preferentially toward levels with @xmath34 , leading to heating rather than cooling .
we will employ krotov s method  @xcite to optimize vibrational cooling of molecules .
the total optimization functional is then split into a final - time target @xmath35 and an intermediate - time cost @xmath36 , @xmath37 and will be minimized .
we choose the intermediate - time cost to minimize the change in pulse fluence  @xcite , @xmath38 ^ 2\,,\ ] ] where @xmath39 is a free parameter , @xmath40 a shape function enforcing the pulses to be switched on and off smoothly and @xmath41 a reference field , taken to be the pulse from the previous iteration .
the final time @xmath42 is also a free parameter .
we construct @xmath35 such as to avoid solution of the liouville von neumann equation for the density matrix during optimization .
this is possible due to a separation of the timescales for spontaneous decay , of the order of 10@xmath2ns , and the coherent interaction of the molecules with laser light , of the order of 10@xmath2ps .
moreover , it allows for determining the laser field that is the best possible compromise , no matter what is the initial state . in other words ,
the same pulse can be used over and over again , accumulating molecules in the target state .
we discuss two possible choices for the final - time functional .      the main idea of this functional is to excite all vibrationally excited ground state levels symmetrically into those excited state levels which preferentially decay toward the target state @xmath43 while minimizing potential heating .
symmetric excitation ensures that all ground state levels in the thermal ensemble are treated homogeneously .
the initial state for each laser pulse is given by an unknown incoherent distribution over ground state vibrational levels , @xmath44 , @xmath45 .
each of these levels is excited by the pulse and subject to the ensuing dynamics , giving rise to wavepackets @xmath46 which decay by spontaneous emission to ground state vibrational levels .
the spontaneous decay of the excited state component of the @xmath47th wavepacket @xmath46 to the target level @xmath48 is determined by the temporally averaged overlap , @xmath49 where @xmath50 denotes the excited state lifetime and @xmath51 is the projector onto the excited electronic state . shifting the time axis by @xmath52 , inserting the completeness relation for vibrational levels on the excited state and denoting the franck - condon factors @xmath53 by @xmath54 , eq .
becomes @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the eigenenergy corresponding to @xmath57 .
the integral is readily evaluated , yielding @xmath58 due to the timescale separation , @xmath59 is at most of the order @xmath60 , and the temporally averaged overlap is well approximated by the second term alone , @xmath61    the timescale separation also allows for neglecting the accidental creation of coherences in the ground state density matrix after each cooling cycle .
while the initial ensemble most likely is a completely incoherent mixture , the state obtained on the ground electronic surface after one cooling cycle may contain coherences .
accidentally , this could lead to accumulation of molecules in an undesired dark state , i.e. , a certain coherent superposition of vibrational eigenstates .
however , the free evolution of the molecule introduces rapidly oscillating prefactors for each eigenstate .
these oscillations are much more rapid than the time necessary for decay to the ground surface .
therefore , the system will be in a superposition of eigenstates with a fixed modulus but random phase before the next pulse arrives . if necessary
, this can be strictly enforced by introducing a small , randomized waiting period between cycles . since a dark state
requires a fixed phase relation , accumulation in the dark state is effectively ruled out .    ignoring coherences , the initial ensemble for each pulse
is described only in terms of the vibrational populations , and maximizing the excitation of each vibrational level corresponds to minimizing @xmath62 symmetric excitation of all levels is ensured by balancing the yield with respect to an arbitrarily chosen level out of the initial ensemble , @xmath63 , @xmath64 @xmath65 is required because otherwise the yield could be maximized by very efficiently exciting only some levels in the initial ensemble .
this would result in incomplete cooling .
in addition to efficiently exciting all vibrationally excited ground state levels , the target state must be kept dark .
this is achieved by enforcing the steady - state condition , @xmath66 a further complication arises from the fact that molecules could dissociate during the cooling process .
this is a source of loss and needs to be strictly prevented . the most efficient way of enforcing this requirement is to avoid leakage out of the initial ensemble of ground state vibrational levels , @xmath67 the first term in eq .   suppresses population transfer , via raman transitions , from the initial ground state ensemble into higher excited ground state levels , whereas the second term suppresses population of excited state levels that have large franck - condon factors with ground state levels outside of the initial ensemble .
@xmath68 does not only counter dissociation of the molecules but also undesired heating .
the complete final - time functional is given by the multi - objective target of keeping the target state dark , efficiently exciting all other vibrational levels in the initial ensemble and avoiding leakage out of the initial ensemble , @xmath69 where the @xmath70 allow to weight the separate contributions differently .
the functional   will yield optimized pulses that cool when used in repeated excitation / deexcitation cycles , unless the molecule under consideration has a franck - condon map that strongly favors heating rather than cooling such that simultaneously fulfilling all targets imposed by the functional becomes very difficult .
this raises the question of what is the minimum requirement on the transition matrix elements to obtain cooling .
it has led us to define a second optimization functional .
the main idea of this functional is to optimize population transfer to the electronically excited state only for a single ground state level @xmath71 .
the excited state levels that are reached from @xmath71 need to have franck - condon factors that are favorable to cooling ( in the extreme case , a single excited state level with favorable franck - condon factor is sufficient ) .
the population of all other vibrationally excited ground state levels is simply reshuffled via raman transitions , populating preferentially @xmath71 .
for example , if the cooling target is the ground state and we choose @xmath72 , all higher levels are reshuffled into the next lower level , forming an assembly line which ends in @xmath73 .
the corresponding functional contains the steady state and leakage terms just as eq .  .
the excitation term now targets only @xmath71 , taken to be @xmath72 , @xmath74 and population reshuffling towards lower vibrational levels is enforced by the assembly - line term , @xmath75 similarly to eq .
, the complete final - time functional for assembly line cooling is given by summing all contributions , @xmath76 with weights @xmath70 .
in eq .  , heating is countered only via the leakage term , whereas eq .   avoids it actively .
the optimization functionals , eq .   and eq .  , represent the starting point for deriving the coupled control equations that must be solved iteratively to obtain the optimized pulse .
following krotov s method  @xcite , we obtain a set of three equations with prescribed discretization for each iteration step @xmath47 :    * forward propagation of each state in the initial thermal ensemble according to @xmath77|\psi^{(i+1)}_n(t)\rangle\ , ,      \quad |\psi^{(i+1)}_n(t=0)\rangle = |\varphi^g_n\rangle\ , , \quad n=1,\ldots , n_{max}\,,\ ] ] with @xmath78 given by eq .  .
* backward propagation of the adjoint states , @xmath79 |\chi^{(i)}_n(t)\rangle \ , ,      \quad |\chi^{(i)}_n(t = t)\rangle =       \nabla_{\langle\psi_n|}j^{sym / ass}_t\big|_{\{|\psi^{(i)}(t)\rangle\ } }      \quad n=1,\ldots , n_{max}\,,\ ] ] with the initial condition at time @xmath80 given by the derivatives of the final - time functional , eq .   or eq .  , with respect to @xmath81 ,
evaluated using the final - time forward propagated states , @xmath82 . * update of the control by @xmath83 with @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 solutions of eqs .   and  , respectively .
@xmath87 is a polynomial of fourth order in the states , whereas @xmath88 is quadratic in the states .
this means that @xmath87 requires the non - linear version of krotov s method , and @xmath89 is given by @xmath90  @xcite . for @xmath88 ,
the linear version is sufficient , i.e. , @xmath91 .
@xmath92 can be estimated analytically by evaluating a supremum over the second order derivatives of @xmath87 , and @xmath93 is a non - negative number .
the analytical estimate of @xmath92 usually is much larger than the actual value of @xmath92 required to ensure monotonicity of the algorithm .
since a large value of @xmath92 slows down convergence , it is much better to approximate @xmath92 numerically , using eq .
( 25 ) of ref .
@xcite .
it turned out , however , that the non - convexity of @xmath94 is small in practice , and both the linear and the non - linear version of krotov s method behave very similarly .
this can be rationalized by the fact that only one term in @xmath87 , @xmath65 , is non - convex and its impact on the convergence is small compared to that of the other terms in @xmath87 .
the results presented below were all obtained for @xmath91 in eq .  .    instead of the square modulus in the overlaps of eqs .
, , and , it is also possible to use the real part of the overlap  @xcite .
this sets a global phase which is not neccessary but shows a better initial convergence for bad guess pulses .
the latter is due to the specific form of the initial costates , @xmath95 , which remain constant for real part functionals while depending linearly on the final - time forward propagated states , @xmath96 , for the square modulus functional .
hence real part functionals can not take values close to zero leading to very small gradients as is the case for square modulus functionals .
this is important in particular for the assembly - line term , for which formulating a good guess pulse is difficult , and our results presented below were obtained with the real part instead of the square modulus in eq .  .
we choose our guess pulses such as to avoid small gradients at the beginning of the optimization . in all examples ,
they are taken to be gaussian transform - limited pulses of moderate intensity with central frequency and spectral width chosen to excite a number of transitions that are relevant for the cooling process .
the latter are easily read off the franck - condon matrices in fig .
[ fig : fcf ] .
the choice of the @xmath97 is determined by the relative importance of the individual terms in the optimization functionals .
a large value for the steady - state and leakage terms are impedient since a low value of these functionals will prevent a high repeatability of the excitation / deexcitation steps , effectively reducing the attainable yield .
in contrast , a slightly lower yield for an individualy step can easily be amended by few additional cycles .
consequently , as a rule of thumb , @xmath98 and @xmath99 should be chosen larger than @xmath100 and @xmath101 or @xmath102 , respectively .
this is more important for the symmetrised cooling since in the assembly line case the leakage is much easier to prevent by virtue of the mechanism .
hence it proved in our calculation sufficient to choose all @xmath39 equal to one for the assembly line functional while it proved useful to choose @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 for the symmetrised functional .

]     molecules using assembly - line cooling : value of the total functional , eq .  , and its components vs iterations of the optimization algorithm ( @xmath106 ) . ]
we first study vibrational cooling of cs@xmath3 molecules , taking @xmath106 . due to the favorable franck - condon map
, optimization is not required in this case but helps to reduce the number of cooling cycles .
the behavior of the single contributions to the optimization functional as well as its total value are plotted in fig .
[ fig : cs2_symm ] for @xmath87 and in fig .
[ fig : cs2_ass ] for @xmath88 . in both cases ,
monotonous convergence is observed for the total functional as expected , cf .
blue dashed lines in figs .
[ fig : cs2_symm ] and  [ fig : cs2_ass ] .
the dark - state condition for the target state is perfectly obeyed for symmetrized excitation throughout the optimization ( green long - dashed line in the inset of fig .
[ fig : cs2_symm ] ) but presents a slightly more difficult constraint to fulfill for assembly - line cooling ( green long - dashed line in the inset of fig .  [ fig : cs2_ass ] , note that the stability of the ground state is given by @xmath107 ) .
a final value of @xmath108 ensures also for assembly - line cooling accumulation in the target state for 10000 cooling cycles .
this is much more than required as we show below . for optimization using @xmath87 , the excitation yield , given by @xmath109 , measures excitation of all levels in the initial ensemble , and reaches a value above 0.9 , cf .
purple dot - dashed line in fig .
[ fig : cs2_symm ] .
this together with the fact that the final value of @xmath65 ( black dotted line in fig .  [ fig : cs2_symm ] ) is @xmath110 implies that a pulse that excites all levels in the initial ensemble with similar efficiency can indeed be found . for optimization
using @xmath88 , the excitation yield , @xmath111 , takes a smaller final value ( purple dot - dashed line in fig .  [
fig : cs2_ass ] ) .
this reflects the fact that @xmath111 measures only excitation out of @xmath112 and its maximum is given by 0.335 , whereas the population reshuffling of the other levels is captured by @xmath113 ( black dotted line in fig .
[ fig : cs2_ass ] ) .
the latter takes a final value close to one , suggesting that the pulse reshuffles all higher excited ground state levels in the desired way .
this indicates efficient excitation at the end of the assembly line as desired .
thus both optimization functionals , eq .   and eq .  , yield pulses which effectively excite all higher vibrational levels while keeping the target state dark . a striking difference between optimization with @xmath87 and @xmath88 is found only in the ability of the optimized pulses to suppress leakage out of the initial ensemble ( red solid lines in fig .
[ fig : cs2_symm ] and  [ fig : cs2_ass ] ) .
while @xmath68 takes a final value of about 0.014 for symmetrized excitation , it can be made smaller than @xmath60 for assembly line cooling . in the latter case ,
@xmath68 could be further decreased by continued optimization , cf .
the slope of the red line in fig .
[ fig : cs2_ass ] .
this is in contrast to fig .
[ fig : cs2_symm ] where @xmath68 remains essentially unchanged after about 200 iterations , suggesting that a hard limit has been reached .
leakage from the cooling subspace thus starts to pose a problem for symmetrized excitation when a few hundred cooling cycles are required .
the different performance of the two optimization functionals is not surprising since @xmath88 is constructed to actively suppress leakage from the initial ensemble ( and the ensuing vibrational heating ) by allowing spontaneous emission only from the most favorable instead of all accessible levels .
the extent to which leakage can be suppressed when employing @xmath88 is nonetheless very gratifying .
molecules using symmetrized excitation ( left ) and assembly - line cooling ( right).,title='fig : ' ]   molecules using symmetrized excitation ( left ) and assembly - line cooling ( right).,title='fig : ' ]    the optimized pulses and their spectra for vibrational cooling of cs@xmath3 are shown in fig .
[ fig : cs2_pulses ] , comparing symmetrized excitation ( left - hand side ) and assembly - line cooling ( right - hand side ) .
the spectral width of the optimized pulses covers about 500@xmath2@xmath114 corresponding to transform - limited pulses of 30@xmath2fs .
this is well within the standard capabilities of current femtosecond technology .
a similar conclusion can be made with respect to the integrated pulse energies : we find @xmath115j for the pulse obtained with @xmath87 in the left - hand side of fig .
[ fig : cs2_pulses ] and @xmath116j for that obtained with @xmath88 in the right - hand side of fig .
[ fig : cs2_pulses ] .
we now turn to the example of lics molecules for which the franck - condon map is not favorable to cooling .
broadband optical pumping with unshaped pulses will thus lead to heating rather than cooling , cf .
[ fig : fcf ] .
we demonstrate in the following that shaping the pulses does , however , yield vibrational cooling .
note that by employing the @xmath29-state , we have chosen the most favorable out of all potential energy curves correlating to the lowest excited state asymptote ( li 2s + cs 6p ) .
for example , the @xmath117 state is expected to be even less suited for cooling .
while the @xmath117-state potential is more deeply bound and could thus be somewhat better in terms of the franck - condon map , it is strongly perturbed by the spin - orbit interaction .
the resulting coupling to triplet states implies a loss from the cooling cycle that , due to the timescale separation of excitation and spontaneous emission , can not be prevented by shaping the pulse .    ) . ]    ) . ]
since the @xmath29-state of lics is comparatively shallow  @xcite , leakage out of the initial ensemble and dissociation of the molecules is a more severe problem than for cs@xmath3 .
we therefore first discuss @xmath118 and show later that assembly - line cooling allows also for larger @xmath119 .
the behavior of the optimization functionals and their single contributions is displayed in fig .  [
fig : lics_symm ] for @xmath87 and in fig .
[ fig : lics_ass ] for @xmath88 .
the overall behavior of the functionals and their components is very similar to that observed for cs@xmath3 in figs .
[ fig : cs2_symm ] and  [ fig : cs2_ass ] .
in particular , both algorithms converge monotonically ( dashed blue lines in figs .
[ fig : lics_symm ] and  [ fig : lics_ass ] ) , the dark - state condition can be very well fulfilled ( green long dashed lines ) , and the excitation is efficient ( purple dot - dashed and black dotted lines ) . the behavior with respect to leakage changes , however , dramatically when going from cs@xmath120 to lics ( red lines in figs .
[ fig : lics_symm ] and  [ fig : lics_ass ] ) : @xmath68 takes final values of 0.16 for symmetrized excitation and 0.009 for assembly - line cooling .
this reflects the franck - condon map being so much more favorable to heating rather than cooling , cf .
[ fig : fcf ] ( right ) , that even with shaped pulses it is difficult to ensure cooling .
in particular , the result for symmetrized excitation is insufficient since @xmath121 implies that losses from the cooling cycle will occur already after few excitation / deexcitation steps .
for @xmath118 , @xmath68 reaches a plateau for symmetrized excitation and assembly - line cooling alike .
this is easily rationalized by inspection of the franck - condon map in fig .
[ fig : fcf ] ( right ) .
in particular , the excited state levels which are reached from @xmath122 , such as @xmath123 , show a large leakage toward higher ground state vibrational levels .
we have therefore also investigated @xmath106 for assembly - line cooling .
most of the levels into which e.g. @xmath123 decays and which represent leakage for @xmath118 are then part of the ensemble .
indeed , we find @xmath124 after 1000 iterations for @xmath106 ( data not shown ) .
moreover , @xmath68 continues to decrease after 1000 iterations , albeit not as steeply as in fig .
[ fig : cs2_ass ] for cs@xmath3 , allowing to push the value of @xmath68 below @xmath125 .    ) and assembly - line cooling ( right , @xmath118 in the top panel , @xmath118 and 10 in the bottom panel).,title='fig : ' ] ) and assembly - line cooling ( right , @xmath118 in the top panel , @xmath118 and 10 in the bottom panel).,title='fig : ' ]    figure  [ fig : lics_pulses ] shows the optimized pulses ( top ) and their spectra ( bottom ) for lics with @xmath118 and symmetrized excitation ( left ) and assembly - line cooling ( right ) .
the bottom left panel of fig .
[ fig : lics_pulses ] displays furthermore the spectrum of the optimized assembly - line pulse obtained for @xmath106 .
the spectral width obtained for @xmath118 covers less than 3000@xmath2@xmath114 , corresponding to the bandwidth of a transform - limited pulse of a few femtoseconds .
the integrated pulse energy amounts to @xmath126j . for @xmath106 , significantly more transitions need to be driven , cf .
[ fig : fcf ] .
it is thus not surprising that both the spectral width of the optimized pulse and its integrated energy are larger than for @xmath118 .
the latter amounts to @xmath127j .
such a pulse is more difficult to realize experimentally than those found for cs@xmath3 .
the spectral width could be reduced by employing spectral constraints  @xcite .
the main point of our current investigation is , however , to demonstrate that optimized pulses lead to vibrational cooling even for molecules with unfavorable franck - condon map .
this is evident from fig .

this is in contrast to spectrally cut pulses without any further shaping which require several thousand cycles for cs@xmath3 and would fail altogether for lics . moreover , a high degree of purity , @xmath131 , is obtained for our optimized pulses with only of the order of 100 excitation / spontaneous emission cycles for both molecules .
we have adapted optimal control theory for cooling internal degrees of freedom to account for the timescale separation between coherent excitation and spontaneous emission .
our approach is based on a basis set expansion of the initial density matrix into vibrational eigenstates .
this has allowed us to carry optimization of vibrational cooling from toy models  @xcite to a first principles description of alkali dimer molecules that are currently studied in cooling experiments  @xcite .
compared to the earlier theoretical predictions where a single long pulse implemented the complete cooling process  @xcite , our approach allows for finding femtosecond pulses that can be repeatedly applied , just as is done in the experiments . shaping the pulses using optimal control allows to significantly reduce the number of excitation / spontaneous emission cycles and reach a high purity of the ground state molecules .
more importantly , it also enables vibrational cooling for molecules where the franck - condon map favors heating rather than cooling .
the derivation of our optimization functionals was based on two different intuitions .
first , simultaneous , symmetric excitation of all ground state levels in the thermal ensemble to the excited state was expected to yield most efficient cooling .
it turned out , however , that this approach has only a limited capability of suppressing leakage out of the initial ensemble to higher lying levels .
in particular for molecules with unfavorable franck - condon map , this algorithm can not avoid vibrational heating and , in extreme cases , dissociation .
we have therefore devised an optimization functional corresponding to assembly - line cooling where only one ground state level is transferred to the excited state while the population of all other vibrationally excited ground state levels is reshuffled via raman transitions . this approach yields pulses that enforce vibrational cooling even for molecules with transition matrix elements favoring heating rather than cooling .
the spectral widths and integrated energies of our optimized pulses are well within the capabilities of current femtosecond technology .
we have demonstrated successful implementation of cooling by calculating the population redistribution over a number of excitation / spontaneous emission steps , proving accumulation of ground state molecules .
our study demonstrates the power of optimal control theory for reaching a control target that might not be accessible by simple , analytical pulse shapes .
however , it also illustrates that optimal control theory is not a black - box tool but requires physical insight , in particular when constructing the optimization functional .
this is crucial when one wants to address fundamental limits for control . in our case
, this corresponds to the question of the minimum requirement on the molecular structure that is necessary to allow for cooling .
the answer to this question determines the controllability of the problem , irrespective of the actual experimental resources such as pulse bandwidth or power .
we find that all that is required is a single excited state level with moderate spontaneous decay probability to the target state and a limited number of significant transition matrix elements for the other ground state vibrational levels .
laser cooling makes use of the simplest quantum reservoir , the vacuum of electric field modes , and has led to the concept of quantum reservoir engineering  @xcite .
analogously , our optimization approach for laser cooling can be generalized to quantum reservoir engineering . since the creation of coherences
can not be neglected in the general case , this requires a basis set expansion in liouville space rather than hilbert space .
such a generalization of our optimal control approach to quantum reservoir engineering is currently in progress .

 our optimization functional is also applicable to the laser cooling of other degrees of freedom provided the cooling cycle consists of coherent excitation and dissipative deexcitation steps whose timescales are separated . "
"radio pulsars are categorized as either `` normal '' or `` recycled '' objects .
normal pulsars are observationally more numerous and are predominantly young isolated objects with spin periods in the range 30 ms @xmath3 s , strong inferred surface dipole magnetic field strengths ( @xmath4 g ) and characteristic ages in the range @xmath5 yr .
recycled pulsars have shorter spin periods ( 1.5 ms @xmath6 ms ) , weaker magnetic fields ( @xmath7 g ) , larger ages ( @xmath8 yr ) and are usually members of binary systems with either white dwarf or neutron star companions .    the normal pulsars are thought to be born in supernovae and spin down due to magnetic dipole braking ( see e.g.  gunn & ostriker 1970 ) . the favoured theory for the origin of recycled pulsars
involves an old neutron star that is spun up ( recycled ) through the accretion of matter from a binary companion which overflows its roche lobe ( bisnovatyi - kogan & komberg 1974 ) . during the spin - up phase
, the system is expected to be visible as an x - ray binary .
the duration of the x - ray phase and amount of spin up depends upon the mass of the companion star . for those companions massive enough to explode as a supernova , the x - ray lifetime is relatively short ( @xmath9 yr ) and the most likely outcome is the disruption of the binary .
those systems fortunate enough to survive the explosion are the double neutron star ( hereafter dns ) binaries ( e.g. , the original binary pulsar b1913 + 16 ) . for less massive companions , where the period of spin up is longer ( @xmath10 yr )
, the subsequent collapse leaves a white dwarf star in orbit around a rapidly spinning millisecond pulsar . for a detailed review of these evolutionary scenarios , see bhattacharya & van den heuvel ( 1991 ) and references therein .    in order to understand the population of recycled pulsars in detail ,
a statistically significant sample is required .
because of their short spin periods and , often , binary orbits , detecting these elusive objects is a computationally intensive process requiring state - of - the - art data acquisition systems , significant data storage and computational power for post processing . in 1994
the penn state pulsar machine ( pspm ) , a new analogue filterbank spectrometer ( cadwell 1997 ) , was installed at the 305-m arecibo telescope and has been in regular use as a pulsar search and timing instrument ever since . in march 2002 , we began using part of a high - speed computer cluster to process various sets of pspm data taken during the latter stages of the arecibo upgrade ( 19968 ) .
to date , we have discovered a dozen new pulsars and re - detected over 40 previously known ones .
preliminary details of the search were given by mclaughlin et al .
( 2003 ) .    here
we report on an isolated 55.7-ms pulsar j0609 + 2130 , one of the first new discoveries from our searches .
while the spin parameters of the new pulsar are similar to other recycled pulsars , the lack of a binary companion poses interesting questions as to its origin .
the layout of the rest of this paper is as follows : in  [ sec : obs ] we briefly describe the survey observations , data acquisition system and analysis pipelines .
the results of the analysis and subsequent timing observations of j0609 + 2130 are given in 
[ sec : res ] .
finally , in  [ sec : disc ] , we discuss the new pulsar s properties in the context of its likely origin and evolution .
the data presented here were taken with the arecibo radio telescope during a 9.5-hr maintenance period in october 1998 when upgrade operations required that the telescope was parked at @xmath11 azimuth .
the 430-mhz line - feed system , traditionally used for pulsar observations , was not available for use on this occasion .
we therefore took advantage of the newly commissioned 430-mhz receiver in the gregorian dome which was in a fixed position at @xmath12 from the zenith .
although the 430-mhz gregorian receiver illuminates less of the dish than the line - feed so that the forward gain is lower ( 11 k / jy cf .  18 k / jy for the line feed ) ,
the lower system temperature ( 45 k cf .  120 k ) and reduced levels of interference make it a very attractive receiver for pulsar searching . in this setup ,
sources at declination @xmath13 drift through the 11-arcmin primary beam in @xmath14 s. the total area covered was @xmath15 deg@xmath16 along an 11-arcmin slice through the galactic anti - centre in the right ascension range @xmath17 centred at @xmath18 .
the incoming signals from the telescope were passed to the pspm which summed the two independent polarizations before 4-bit sampling the band into @xmath19-khz channels every 80 @xmath20s . for this choice of sampling interval ,
a @xmath21-pt fourier transform is well matched to the 44-s transit time of sources through the 430-mhz beam .
the resulting data were then written directly to magnetic tape for offline analysis .    searches for periodic and transient radio signals in the data were carried out using cobra , a 180-processor beowulf cluster at jodrell bank observatory . deferring a more complete discussion for a future paper , we now briefly outline the main procedures . to correct for the dispersive effects of the interstellar medium
, the raw pspm data were dedispersed at 392 different trial dispersion measures ( dms ) in the range @xmath22 dm @xmath23 @xmath24 pc using freely available analysis tools ( lorimer 2001 ) .
the resulting dedispersed time series were then passed to two different analysis pipelines . in the first ,
the data were fourier transformed and the resulting amplitude spectra were searched for significant features indicating the presence of a periodic signal . to increase the sensitivity to narrow duty cycle pulses , spectra summing 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 harmonics were also searched .
candidates with signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratios above 8 were then analysed in the time and radio frequency domain to produce diagnostic plots which were saved for later visual inspection .
further details can be found in lorimer et al .
( 2000 ) .    in the second analysis pipeline ,
the dedispersed data were searched in the time domain for pulses with s / n @xmath25 using software developed by cordes & mclaughlin ( 2003 ) .
this search was aimed at finding individual and giant pulses from some pulsars where the periodic signal may be below the threshold of the fourier analysis ( see e.g.  nice 1999 ) . to maximize sensitivity over a variety of pulse widths ,
each time series was smoothed by up to 64 adjacent samples .
given the measured system equivalent flux density of the 430-mhz gregorian receiver ( 3.3 jy ) , we estimate the sensitivity of the fourier analysis to be @xmath26 mjy to long - period pulsars observed away from the galactic plane . for millisecond pulsars , with typical periods of 5 ms and pulse duty cycles of order 60%
, we estimate the sensitivity to be closer to 3 mjy .
the detection threshold of the single - pulse search is about 0.5 jy to the narrowest pulses .
full details of the search sensitivity will be presented elsewhere .
two pulsar - like signals were detected in the periodicity search .
one of these was the 33-ms crab pulsar , b0531 + 21 ( also seen in the single - pulse analysis ) detected in several adjacent beams with s / n @xmath27 .
the remaining candidate , a 55.7-ms signal with dm @xmath28 and s / n @xmath29 , was re - observed and confirmed as the new pulsar j0609 + 2130 in april 2002 . only one other previously known pulsar , b0525 + 21 , lies within the region covered by this search .
this was not detected in either the periodicity or the single - pulse search .
a closer scrutiny of the raw search data revealed no detectable signal . since the data were not obviously affected by radio - frequency interference ,
two possible effects are responsible for the non - detection : either ( a ) since this pulsar is known to null for approximately 25% of the time ( biggs 1990 ) it is quite likely that the survey observations caught this pulsar in a null state ; or ( b ) the pulsar s flux density was significantly reduced by diffractive interstellar scintillation . given the normally high mean flux density of this pulsar ( 57 mjy at 408 mhz ; lorimer et al .
1995 ) , nulling seems the most likely explanation for the non - detection .    to determine the detailed spin and astrometric parameters of j0609 + 2130 ,
we have been carrying out regular 430-mhz timing observations since june 2002 .
these observations use the pspm in timing mode , where the incoming signals are folded modulo the period predicted from an ephemeris initially derived from the confirmation observation . in timing mode , folded 1024-bin pulse profiles for each of the 128 frequency channels of the pspm are written to disk every 180 s. we initially collected at least three of these 180-s observations per epoch in order to enable high - precision estimates of the pulse period . the timing analysis proceeded by forming the dedispersed profile across the band of the pspm for each 180-s observation and estimating the pulse phase by cross correlating each profile with a high s / n template using procedures identical to those described in detail by lorimer , camilo & xilouris ( 2002 ) .

are calculated as described in 
[ sec : disc ] .
the distance is derived using the galactic electron density model of cordes & lazio ( 2003 ) .
the topocentric pulse arrival times were fitted to a simple timing model involving spin and astrometric parameters using the tempo software package .
once a preliminary phase - connected timing solution was obtained , a better template was formed by phase - aligning the pulse profiles according to the best - fit model .
the final template profile is shown in fig .
[ fig:430prof+flux ] . as part of this refinement procedure , individual 180-s observations on a given day were phase aligned and averaged together to produce one pulse arrival time per observing session .
the estimate of dm from the search analysis was improved by analysing pspm observations with the 327-mhz and 610-mhz gregorian receivers on february 17 , 2003 , and using tempo to fit for the dispersion delay between the frequency bands . the best - fit timing model for 30 arrival times spanning the mjd range 5242752796 results in featureless timing model residuals with a post - fit rms of 44 @xmath20s .
the resulting parameters are given in table [ tab : timing ] .
psr  j0609 + 2130 is a very weak radio source . using the calibration procedures described by lorimer , camilo & xilouris ( 2002 )
, we find the mean 430-mhz flux density of the pulsar @xmath33 to be only @xmath43 mjy at 430 mhz .
given the distance estimate @xmath44 kpc from the new electron density model of cordes & lazio ( 2003 ) , the 430-mhz radio luminosity @xmath45 mjy kpc@xmath16 .
only 10 out of the 612 pulsars currently in the online catalogue with measured luminosities are fainter sources than psr  j0609 + 2130 .
the pulsar s flux density is clearly affected by interstellar scintillation .
we observe variations between 0.1 and 5 mjy as shown in fig .
[ fig:430prof+flux ] .
indeed , for about 75% of the observations we have taken , the flux density is below our nominal survey threshold of about 1 mjy for this pulsar .
although our observations at other frequencies are not yet numerous enough to characterize the radio spectrum of j0609 + 2130 with any certainty , our preliminary flux estimate of 2 mjy at 327-mhz implies that it is a steep - spectrum source that is most readily detectable in low - frequency surveys .
our timing measurements of psr  j0609 + 2130 reveal a period derivative @xmath46 .
psr  j0609 + 2130 therefore appears to be a an old neutron star with characteristic age @xmath47 gyr and a relatively weak surface dipolar magnetic field @xmath48 g. of all the sources in the current pulsar catalogue , the one which has properties most similar to j0609 + 2130 is psr  j2235 + 1506 , a solitary 57.9-ms pulsar with @xmath49 ( camilo , nice & taylor 1993 , 1996 ) .
the positions of both these pulsars on the @xmath50 diagram are shown in fig .
[ fig : bp ] . as can be seen ,
j0609 + 2130 and j2235 + 1506 are the only two solitary pulsars in this part of the diagram .
we shall return to the positions in the @xmath50 plane later in the discussion .      based on the close proximity and low radio luminosities of j0609 + 2130 and j2235 + 1506
we expect pulsars like them to be quite common in the galaxy . indeed , kalogera & lorimer ( 2000 ) estimated the galactic population of pulsars like j2235 + 1506 to be @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the fraction of @xmath53 sr covered by the radio beam . for a beaming fraction of 30%
( i.e.  @xmath54 ) the galactic population of these objects is likely to be of order 15,000 .    what is the origin of weakly magnetized isolated pulsars like j0609 + 2130 and j2235 + 1506 ?
one possibility is that they are simply part of the same population as the normal pulsars .
to investigate this idea quantitatively , we can take the best - fitting initial magnetic field distribution in a recent population study of isolated pulsars by arzoumanian , chernoff & cordes ( 2002 ) . for their distribution ,
only about one in the expected galactic population of @xmath38 neutron stars is born with @xmath55 g , clearly inconsistent with the population estimates made above . unless there is a weak - field component to the neutron star magnetic field distribution that has been overlooked by population studies so far , a more efficient means of forming these weakly - magnetized neutron stars is required .
a pulsar born with a stronger magnetic field could , in principle , evolve to resemble psr  j0609 + 2130 through long - term decay of the magnetic field . while the existence of field decay for the pulsar population at large remains controversial ( see e.g.  bhattacharya et al .
1992 ) , available evidence suggests that , for objects comparable in age and magnetic - field strength to j0609 + 2130 , any decay must act on extremely long timescales .
where such pulsars are found in binary systems , studies of their white - dwarf companions provide an independent age estimate through cooling models , affirming the long - lived nature of the pulsars and constraining the existence of field decay ( kulkarni 1986 ) .
of course , j0609 + 2130 is an isolated pulsar , but it seems unlikely that non - binarity would somehow encourage rapid field decay .
camilo , nice & taylor ( 1993 ) suggested that j2235 + 1506 might be the remains of a high - mass binary system that disrupted at the time of the second supernova explosion . in this scenario , psrs j0609 + 2130 and j2235 + 1506 are the first - born neutron stars in their respective binaries and initially spin down as regular neutron stars . during roche - lobe overflow from the subsequently evolved secondary star ,
mass accretion reduces the magnetic field ( see e.g.  romani 1990 ) , and also spins up the neutron star in the process .
if the secondary is sufficiently massive to undergo a supernova explosion , the most likely outcome is disruption of the binary , releasing a newly - born neutron star and a recycled pulsar .
those binary systems more likely to survive this explosion as dns binaries are the tightly - bound systems with short orbital periods .
the wider binaries , which are much less likely to survive the explosion , release recycled pulsars with spin properties akin to j0609 + 2130 and j2235 + 1506 into the galactic field .
we hereafter refer to these as `` disrupted recycled pulsars '' ( drps ) .    using this evolutionary scenario for drps as a working hypothesis ,
we now return to the @xmath50 diagram in fig .  [ fig : bp ] to investigate the post - accretion spin periods of drps after the accretion phase . in their analysis of dns binaries , arzoumanian , cordes & wasserman ( 1999 ; hereafter acw )
discuss two equilibrium spin period relations for the spin - up of a neutron star in a binary system .
the first of these is the familiar limit for spherical accretion of matter in which the limiting spin period is set by the corresponding keplerian orbital period at the so - called alfvn radius ( see e.g.  ghosh & lamb 1992 ) . on the @xmath50 plane
, this translates to a relationship of the form @xmath56 .
the constant of proportionality in this expression depends on a number of factors such as the mass accretion rate , the radius and moment of inertia of the neutron star and the opacity of the accreting material .
the uncertainties in these parameters result in a family of @xmath56 curves .
two such curves , assuming accretion at the eddington rate and at one - fifth of this value , are plotted on fig .
[ fig : bp ] using the relationship quoted by acw . for any pulsar , in the absence of magnetic field decay , we can estimate the spin period at the end of the accretion phase by tracing a horizontal line from the current position on fig .
[ fig : bp ] to the spin - up line . under these assumptions
, we infer that the intial spin period of j0609 + 2130 and j2235 + 1506 would have been in the range 1020 ms .
acw pointed out that , for high - mass binary systems , the above picture is oversimplified since the lifetime of the donor star will be much less than the accretion time scale at which the alfvn limit is reached .
they show that this condition produces a second family of limiting period curves which , on the @xmath50 plane , take the form @xmath57 . as noted by acw ,
these curves are much more sensitive to uncertainties in the accretion parameters . in fig .
[ fig : bp ] we plot two such spin - up lines , again assuming accretion at the eddington rate and one - fifth of this limit .
it is clear that , for sub - eddington accretion , the initial spin period of these drps would be much longer , perhaps very similar to their currently observed spin periods .    as noted by acw , since pulsar characteristic ages @xmath58 assume a negligible post - accretion spin period
, one consequence of these accretion scenarios is that dns binaries are younger objects than their characteristic ages suggest .
if drps are formed by a similar process , the same applies to them .
for example , a more likely `` post - spinup '' age for j0609 + 2130 based on a limiting spin period of 40 ms would be about half its characteristic age ( i.e.  about 1.5 gyr ) .      is the drp hypothesis consistent with the observations ?
one parameter that can be confronted by both theory and observation is the `` survival probability '' of the binary system , hereafter @xmath59 , defined as the fraction of binary systems that remain bound after the second supernova explosion .
numerous authors have followed the orbital evolution of a wide variety of binary systems containing neutron stars using detailed monte carlo simulations ( see e.g.  lipunov & prokhorov 1984 ; dewey & cordes 1987 ; fryer & kalogera 1997 ) .
we use the relatively up - to - date simulations of portegies zwart & yungelson ( 1998 ) who include a maxwellian kick velocity distribution with a mean of 415 km s@xmath1 in their simulations . from the results presented in table 1 of their paper , for this model
, we infer @xmath60 .
based upon this low survival probability , we therefore expect drps to be much more common in the galaxy than the dns binaries .
to estimate @xmath59 from an observational perspective , we note that the expected spin parameters of the recycled pulsar we observe in a dns binary are the same as those of the putative drps .
we can therefore reasonably expect the pulsars in dns binaries to have the same radio lifetimes as the drps .
hence , if @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the total numbers of dns binaries and drps in the galaxy , it follows that @xmath63 using the results of a recent population study of dns binaries by kim , kalogera & lorimer ( 2003 ) , we take @xmath64 population to be @xmath65 ( a factor of 2 higher than quoted by kim , kalogera & lorimer 2003 , to crudely account for the population of dns binaries that do not coalesce in a hubble time ) . using the above estimate of @xmath66
, we find @xmath67 .
one outstanding issue is the observed numbers of drps . given the above estimate for @xmath59 , we would expect to see roughly 10 drps for each dns binary .
so far , however , we have identified only two drps : j0609 + 2130 and j2235 + 1506 , compared to four dns binaries in fig .
[ fig : bp ] .
three main possibilities which might explain this apparently significant deficit of drps are : ( a ) drps are present in the observed sample , but are hard to identify since they have no binary companion .
although there are perhaps a further four drp - like pulsars known ( see table 1 of kalogera & lorimer 2000 ) , a more thorough analysis of the sample would be worthwhile .
( b ) the neutron star kick velocity distribution could be lower than assumed in the population synthesis .
this would lead to an increase in @xmath59 and reduce the discrepancy .
a population synthesis dedicated to this question would certainly be useful .
( c ) the above drp population estimates are somewhat crude and are based currently on j2235 + 1506 which is a nearby , low - luminosity object .
a revision of these estimates to better account for small - number statistics is strongly recommended .    in summary ,
while it seems currently plausible that j0609 + 2130 and j2235 + 1506 are examples of disrupted x - ray binary systems , there are a number of open issues linking the two populations .
careful population studies to properly identify and estimate the drp population and binary population syntheses to predict the survival rate are both strongly recommended .
further observational input should come both in the substantial numbers of pulsars now being found in the parkes multibeam survey ( manchester et al .
2001 ) , and also proper motion measurements . for j2235 + 1506 ,
the implied transverse speed is @xmath68 km s@xmath1 ( camilo , nice & taylor 1996 ) .
if j0609 + 2130 has a similar proper motion , it should be detectable in our on - going arecibo timing observations by early 2005 .

pasp , p 129 ( astro - ph/0211261 )" ," we report the discovery and initial timing observations of a 55.7-ms pulsar , j0609 + 2130 , found during a 430-mhz drift - scan survey with the arecibo radio telescope . with a spin - down rate of @xmath0 s s@xmath1 and an inferred surface dipole magnetic field of only @xmath2  g , j0609 + 2130 
 has very similar spin parameters to the isolated pulsar j2235 + 1506 found by camilo , nice & taylor ( 1993 ) . 
 while the origin of these weakly magnetized isolated neutron stars is not fully understood , one intriguing possibility is that they are the remains of high - mass x - ray binary systems which were disrupted by the supernova explosion of the secondary star .

] of the earth s atmosphere and intensively exchanges mass ( e.g. , moisture ) , momentum , and heat with the underlying surface @xcite .
wind fields in this turbulent layer play major roles in a wide range of industrial ( e.g. , stack gas dispersion , wind energy generation ) , biological ( e.g. , evapotranspiration , pollen transport , migrations of birds and insects ) , and natural ( e.g. , soil erosion , transport , and deposition ) activities and processes .
thus , it is not surprising that numerous studies have been conducted over the past decades for the multiscale characterizations of the abl wind fields .
diverse methodologies with varying degrees of complexities , ranging from the traditional spectral methods @xcite to the new - generation multifractal approaches @xcite , have been utilized .    to this date , the majority of the studies dealing with the identification of anomalous scaling ( sometimes even multifractality ) in the abl wind field focused on the microscale range ( time - scale of tenths of a second to tens of minutes ) .
in contrast , only a handful of studies @xcite delved into characterizing the mesoscale range ( approximately , sub - hourly to sub - daily time - scale ) .
they analyzed observational datasets from field sites around the world ( e.g. , china , france , new zealand , italy , the netherlands , turkey , and the usa ) .
even though a few of these studies did not use wind data with adequate temporal resolution or sample size , the evidences of anomalous scaling in the mesoscale range were beyond any doubt .
most remarkably , muzy et al .
@xcite and bale and muzy @xcite found the intermittent nature of mesoscale wind fluctuations to be similar to its microscale counterpart ( encompassing the inertial - range of turbulence ) .
similar conclusions were also recently drawn by liu and hu @xcite .
owing to the dearth of long - term , high - quality upper abl data , almost all the aforementioned mesoscale wind characterization studies focused on the near - surface ( around 1020 m from the ground ) region .
the only exception being the study by telesca and lovallo @xcite .
they analyzed multi - year sodar - based wind data from various heights ( 50 m to 213 m ) above ground level ( agl ) .
they used the multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis and the fisher - shannon information plane approaches to detect any signature of multifractality in wind speed time - series .
interestingly , they found the scaling exponents to be strongly dependent on height . however , no physical explanation was provided .
it is , however , plausible to speculate that the buoyancy effects are at the root of this height - dependency trait .    in the literature ,
it is well - known that the shear production of turbulence overpowers the buoyancy effects near the surface .
however , buoyancy forcing becomes increasingly dominant as one moves away from the surface @xcite .
however , it is not known whether the buoyancy forcing modulates the anomalous scaling behavior of wind speed in the mesoscale range .
therefore , we decided to address this intriguing issue in the present study .
we make use of long - term wind datasets from several field sites with diverse geographical and climatological conditions ( table  [ tab : table1 ] ) .
these datasets are measured with the aid of different types of research - grade instruments ( e.g. , cup anemometers , sodars ) .
they all have a common averaging time of 10 min .
more importantly , they all span the lower part of the abl and not just the near - surface region .
fino 1 is an offshore platform in the north sea @xcite .
it consists of a 100 m tall meteorological tower equipped with wind speed measurement sensors ( cup anemometers ) at heights of 33 m , 40 m , 50 m , 60 m , 70 m , 80 m , 90 m , and 100 m. a total of 91 months of wind speed data collected over a period of nine years ( 20042012 ) are utilized in the present study .    over the past four decades
, observational data from the cabauw ( the netherlands ) meteorological tower have been used in various abl studies @xcite .
we use 170 months of wind speed data ( collected during the years 20012015 ) measured by propeller vanes at heights of 10 m , 20 m , 40 m , 80 m , 140 m , and 200 m. we would like to point out that even though the landscape at cabauw is quite flat and open ( grassland ) , the existence of wind breaks and scattered villages cause significant disturbances in the near - surface region @xcite .
the impact of this non - equilibrium behavior on scaling characteristics will be noted later in this paper .
recently , the west texas mesonet ( wtm ) has installed sodars ( manufacturer : scintec , model : mfas ) at san angelo , midland , and reese technology center ( rtc ) , lubbock ( the usa ) .
the typical vertical range of these sodars is from 30 m to approximately 300 m agl .
they have a vertical resolution of 10 m. from the past two years ( 20132014 ) , we selected 8 months of wind speed data for scaling analysis .
all the aforementioned datasets contain variable amount of missing data .
this data - loss problem is more severe for the sodars .
since a sodar is an active ground based acoustic remote sensing instrument , it suffers from signal attenuation at higher altitudes @xcite . to account for the data - loss problem in an objective manner across the sites , we perform the following data pre - processing procedures .
first , instead of analyzing an entire time - series ( with sporadic gaps ) from any site , we split it into several monthly time - series ( each containing about 4300 samples ) .
we discard a specific month s data from further analysis if any of the vertical levels contain more than 20% of missing samples . by performing this simple data exclusion strategy
, we ensure that for a given site , all the tower / sodar levels have more - or - less ( within 20% ) the same amount of samples . in the case of the wtm sodar data
, we have added an additional constraint .
we consider only the months during which all the three sodars collected wind data simultaneously .    prior to scaling analysis ,
we normalize ( zero mean , unit variance ) each monthly time - series .
various orders of structure functions ( defined below ) are computed based on each normalized monthly time - series and then averaged over the different months .
the normalization procedure aids in the visual detection of any collapse of computed statistics from various heights ( agl ) .
.[tab : table1]description of measurement sites [ cols='<,^,^,^ ' , ]
in the turbulence literature , the scaling exponent spectrum , @xmath2 , is defined as @xcite : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the so - called @xmath5-th order structure function .
the angular bracket denotes spatial averaging and @xmath6 is a separation distance that varies within a specific scaling range ( e.g. , inertial - range ) . for time - series analysis ( where taylor s hypothesis is inapplicable ) ,
the usage of time increment , @xmath7 ( in lieu of @xmath6 ) , and temporal averaging is customary .
this approach is followed here .
according to kolmogorov s celebrated 1941 hypothesis ( k-41 ; @xcite ) , @xmath8 in the isotropic inertial - range of turbulence . in the buoyancy - range , for the velocity field , the hypothesis of bolgiano @xcite leads to : @xmath9 . over the years , several laboratory and numerical studies
@xcite have corroborated the existence of bolgiano scaling in different types of convection .
its presence has also been indicated in the scaling of near - surface temperature field @xcite and vertical wind speed profiles @xcite . however , to the best of our knowledge , this scaling has never been reported for the abl ( horizontal ) wind field .
forty years ago , monin and yaglom ( pp .
393 of @xcite ) wrote :  it is therefore probable that the formulas given above [ in the context of bolgiano scaling ] will be valid beginning with heights of the order of 100 m [ above the surface ] .
the verification of this conclusion will require special observations which one hopes will be carried out in the future ' .
we are fortunate to have access to such ` special observations ' , and thus , will be able to address a few unresolved scaling issues of wind speed in the mesoscale range .    in figs .
[ sf2-fino1][sf2-wtm ] , the second - order structure functions ( @xmath10 ) and their corresponding local slopes ( @xmath11 , ) are shown for fino 1 , cabauw , and wtm sodars . the following assertions can be made based on these figures :         +         [ [ fino-1 ] ] fino 1 + + + + + +    * extended scaling regimes are clearly discernible in all the structure function plots .
* the @xmath11 values increase monotonically with height .
* these slopes are lower for the smaller time - increments ( i.e. , @xmath12 h ) in comparison to the larger ones ( i.e. , 2 h @xmath13 h ) . * for lower heights and smaller time - increments ,
@xmath11 values are close to the k-41 prediction ( i.e. , @xmath14 ) .
interestingly , the slopes remain significantly smaller than bolgiano s prediction of 6/5 for all heights and for all time - increments . *
the scaling characteristics is ( almost ) indistinguishable between the daytime and nighttime cases .
this behavior is somewhat expected at an offshore site where sea surface temperature ( generally ) exhibits a weak diurnal cycle .
[ [ cabauw ] ] cabauw + + + + + +    * once again , extended scaling regimes are clearly present in all the @xmath10 plots .
* the @xmath11 values increase with height with the exception of the lowest two tower levels .
this discrepancy near the surface is possibly due to the disturbances caused by wind breaks and other sources of heterogeneity . * in contrast to the fino 1 results , the scaling characteristics at cabauw is strongly dependent on the time of the day . during nighttime
( typically stably stratified condition over land ) , @xmath11 values are much larger than their corresponding daytime ( typically convective condition over land ) values . * the @xmath11 values ( approximately ) equal to 2/3 for specific time - increment ranges and certain heights .
however , these @xmath11 values always remain much smaller than 6/5 .
[ [ wtm - sodars ] ] wtm sodars + + + + + + + + + +    * despite the limited sample size , for all the three sodar - based wind speed datasets , extended scaling regimes are visible . * as before ,
the height - dependency of @xmath11 is clearly noticeable for all the cases .
however , this dependency is more pronounced at rtc followed by midland .
in contrast , the trend is much weaker at san angelo .
* in the case of san angelo and midland , the @xmath11 values are close to the k-41 value of 2/3 for @xmath7 up to 1 h for all the levels . however , at rtc , only wind speed at the lowest level portrays similar behavior .
* at rtc , for @xmath15
m , the slopes are remarkably stable ( long plateau ) ; the @xmath11 values are close to 1 .
* at midland , a dual - scaling behavior is discernible for @xmath16 m. for @xmath17 h , @xmath11 is approximately equal to 2/3 ; the slopes increase for larger @xmath7 .    in summary , @xmath11 in the mesoscale range systematically depends on height and time - increment range . in the following section , we provide a physical explanation for the height - dependency by further analyzing the wtm sodar datasets .

height is above ground level.,title='fig:',width=288 ]    the wtm sodars are located in the west texas panhandle region of the us , one of the largest semiarid regions in the world .
this region is gently sloping , homogeneous , and sparsely vegetated . nocturnal low - level jets ( lljs ; @xcite )
occur frequently over this region .
these lljs and associated wind speed maxima are one of the most important reasons for the abundance of wind farms , as well as significant nighttime wind power production , over this region @xcite .    in order to explain the height - dependency of @xmath11 , time - height plots of averaged ( over an eight month period ) wind speed at the measurement sites
are shown in fig .
[ wsp ] . during the daytime ,
the wind fields are well - mixed as would be physically expected and the differences across the sites are marginal
. however , the nighttime scenarios are completely different . even though the lljs are frequently present at all of the sites , their locations are significantly different .
it appears that the distance between the llj and the underlying surface decreases with increasing site elevation ( see table  [ tab : table1 ] ) .
similar observations were reported at a different site over the us great plains by song et al .
@xcite .
one of the primary mechanisms for the formation of the lljs is the so - called inertial oscillation @xcite . according to this mechanism , the buoyancy effects largely contribute to the formation and dynamical evolution of the lljs .
thus , based on fig .
[ wsp ] ( please refer to appendix  [ stratification ] for further evidence ) , one could conjecture that the buoyancy effects will be increasing from san angelo to rtc ( via midland ) .    the results in fig .
[ sf2-wtm ] which show the scaling exponents increasing from san angelo to rtc ( via midland ) are definitely in line with this conjecture . in other words ,
the height - dependency of the scaling exponents is likely due to buoyancy effects .
similar height - dependency was reported in a wind - tunnel study @xcite . in that case ,
enhanced shear near the surface decreased the scaling exponents from the corresponding inertial - range values . in our case
, the trend is reversed due to the buoyancy effects .
to further characterize scaling in the mesoscale regime , we next invoke the extended self - similarity ( ess ) framework by benzi and his co - workers @xcite . numerous studies ( see @xcite and the references therein ) have demonstrated the strength of ess in terms of identifying scaling regimes even when the traditional structure function approach completely fails . in fig .
[ ess ] , we show @xmath10 vs. @xmath18 and @xmath19 vs. @xmath18 . all the structure function values corresponding to @xmath20 6 h are considered . remarkably , the height - dependency and dual - scaling behaviors have ( almost ) disappeared in these plots .
similar masking effects of ess were also reported by ruiz - chavarria et al .
@xcite and aivalis et al .
@xcite for completely different types of flows .    based on the ess plots ,
one can calculate the relative scaling exponents @xmath21 .
these values are reported in fig .
[ ess ] . given their close agreement across diverse sites , we speculate that @xmath22 values are probably quasi - universal
. please note that these values are marginally different ( more intermittent ) from the commonly reported inertial - range values in the turbulence literature @xcite : @xmath23 and @xmath24 .
in other words , the scaling characteristics of the near - surface wind field in the mesoscale regime appears to be similar to the inertial - range , but not exactly the same .
this finding is in line with the recent literature @xcite .
in this study , we provide empirical evidence of quasi - universal scaling of abl wind speed in the mesoscale range .
this quasi - universality is only evident when the ess framework is employed . without this framework ,
the scaling exponents portray systematic dependence on height and buoyancy effects .
further observational data analyses are needed in order to gain further confidence on these noteworthy findings .
if the ess - based quasi - universal scaling holds for other geographical and meteorological regions ( e.g. , polar region , complex terrain ) , then it can be utilized as a benchmark for the development of next - generation planetary boundary layer parameterizations .
in this appendix , we investigate if the diurnal cycles have any impact on the scaling exponents in the mesoscale regime . for this task , we utilize discrete wavelet transform ( symmlet-8 wavelet ) with a filter - scale of 21.33 h ( @xmath25 min ) , following basu et al .  @xcite . in the top - panel of fig .  [ detrend ] , an illustration of the filtering approach is provided . in the bottom panel of this figure , various scaling statistics based on the filtered wind speed data from the cabauw tower are shown .
these plots can be compared against their unfiltered counter - parts reported in fig .
[ sf2-cabauw ] and fig .
clearly , the diurnal cycles have insignificant impact on the reported scaling exponents for @xmath26 h.
two 10 m tall mesonet stations are located in close proximity of the sodars at san angelo and rtc .
air temperature ( 5 min average ) at heights 2 m and 9 m ( agl ) are available from both these stations .
we first calculate the temporal evolution of nocturnal cooling as follows : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the mean potential temperature at height @xmath29 . the initial time ( @xmath30 )
is taken as 9 pm cst ( i.e. , 3 am utc ) .
next , we estimate stratification in the 2 m  9 m layer via the following relationship : @xmath31 from overall flux - divergence consideration , more negative values of @xmath32 signify stronger stratification . in contrast , small positive values denote weakly unstable condition . based on 8 months of data (
i.e. , 243 nocturnal @xmath33 time - series ) , fig .
[ dcr ] is created .
clearly , the stratification level is much stronger at rtc than at san angelo . in other words ,
[ dcr ] provides further evidence to our earlier conjecture that the buoyancy effects are more dominant at rtc in comparison to san angelo .

"the successful launch of the _ spitzer space telescope _ @xcite recently opened a new exciting window on the deep infrared ( ir ) universe . _
spitzer _ operates between 3.6 and 160@xmath1 m with unprecedented sensitivity and better spatial resolution compared to previous infrared satellites ( e.g. , _ iras , _ _ iso _ ) . directly probing the dust emission or the redshifted signature of distant stellar populations ,
its first extragalactic surveys have already unveiled a huge number of faint and high redshift sources ( see for instance * ? ? ?
* ; * ? ? ?
* ; * ? ? ?
* ; * ? ? ?
* ; * ? ? ?
* ; * ? ? ?
* ; * ? ? ?
* ; * ? ? ?
* in the _  spitzer _ special edition 
volume154  of the _ apj supplement _ ) .
_ spitzer _ therefore provides new opportunities to determine the ir properties of galaxies in the general context of cosmic evolution .
high redshift sources detected by _
spitzer _ in the mid- and far - infrared wavelength range ( i.e. , 8@xmath1 m @xmath26@xmath27@xmath41000@xmath1 m ) are characterized by intrinsically very high luminosities @xcite .
they appear as the distant analogs of the local luminous and ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( respectively lirgs : @xmath28l@xmath29 l@xmath30l@xmath31 \leq 10^{12}$]l@xmath8 , and ulirgs : l@xmath32l@xmath8 , see the review by @xcite ) . such infrared - luminous sourcesl@xmath8 . ]
emit the bulk of their energy as dust - reprocessed thermal ir emission powered by embedded star formation or by accreted material surrounding supermassive black holes .
they were first discovered in the nearby universe with ground - based observations @xcite . after being systematically catalogued by _ iras _
@xcite , they were found to be locally very rare and to only account for @xmath05% of the total infrared energy emitted by galaxies at low redshift @xcite .
nevertheless , there is clear evidence that they were significantly more numerous earlier in cosmic history . in the past few years
, deep observations performed in the infrared by _ iso _ and in the submillimeter by the scuba camera have revealed strong evolution of these luminous sources with lookback time @xcite , that is also apparent in the population of radio sources at @xmath1jy flux levels ( e.g. , * ? ? ?
. characterized by a high redshift space density several orders of magnitude larger than predicted by non - evolving models , infrared luminous galaxies contribute a significant fraction of the distant starbursting activity and play a crucial role in the formation of massive spheroidals throughout the cosmic ages ( e.g. , * ? ? ?
* ; * ? ? ?
* ; * ? ? ?
* ; * ? ? ?
* ; * ? ? ?
* ; * ? ? ?
this strong evolution of infrared - selected sources has also been clearly seen by _ spitzer _
( @xcite , @xcite , hereafter p04 ; @xcite ) .
one of the most interesting results of the _ spitzer _ deep surveys is the behavior of the differential number counts at 24@xmath1 m .
these counts turn over at fluxes lower than had been expected based on `` pre - launch '' models .
@xcite suggest that these counts reveal even more luminous galaxies @xmath2@xmath61.5 than expected , though one could argue that they can also originate from a steeper faint - end slope of the infrared luminosity function at more modest redshifts . to better understand the nature of the sources responsible for this turn - over and also more generally the role of infrared galaxies in cosmic evolution ,
we examine in this paper the evolution of the comoving ir energy density with redshift up to @xmath2@xmath01 .
this study is based on a sample of 24@xmath1m - selected _ spitzer _ sources within the chandra deep field south and characterized by redshifts taken from the literature . a companion publication by bell et al .
( 2005 ) explores in more detail the role played by these sources in the decline of the star formation history since @xmath2@xmath00.7 .
the paper is organized as follows . in sect.2
we describe the infrared and optical data used in this study , while sect.3 outlines the results of the cross - correlations that we performed among catalogs to determine the redshifts of infrared - selected sources . in sect.4
we study the contribution of these infrared galaxies to the total counts at 24@xmath1 m for various redshift limits and present a comparison with the predictions from various recent models of ir galaxy evolution . using different libraries of templates published in the literature ,
we further derive in sect.5 an estimate of the total infrared luminosities of these sources based on our mid - infrared observations . in sect.6
we analyze a few properties of their optical counterparts and we finally explore in sect.7 how the evolution of the infrared luminosity function at @xmath33 in the cdfs can be constrained using our data .
interpretations are discussed in sect.8 , and we give our conclusions in sect.9 . throughout this work ,
we assume a @xmath34cdm cosmology with h@xmath35=70  km  s@xmath36mpc@xmath36 , @xmath37=0.3 and @xmath38 @xcite . unless explicitly stated , magnitudes are quoted within the vega system .
we also adopt the universal initial mass function from @xcite .
the region of the chandra deep field south ( hereafter cdfs , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , j2000 ) was observed with the mips instrument @xcite on - board the _ spitzer space telescope _ in january 2004 as part of the mips guaranteed time observing program .
these observations were performed over a total field of @xmath01.45@xmath120.4=0.6deg@xmath41 with the so - called `` slow scan '' technique , a mips observing mode that allows the coverage of large sky areas with high efficiency .
the detector at 24@xmath1 m uses a 2.45pixel size array of 128@xmath12128 elements and the image at this wavelength is characterized by a point spread function ( psf ) with a full - width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of @xmath06 .
the effective integration time per sky pixel was @xmath01380s .
data reduction was carried out using the mips data analysis tool ( dat , * ? ? ?
the mosaic finally obtained has a pixel scale of half that of the physical detector pixel .
a color version of this 24@xmath1 m map can be seen in the publication by @xcite .
a sub - region of this field is also illustrated in figure1 .
.3 cm    0.2 cm .2 cm
[ fig : z_distrib ]    since most sources are unresolved in our data , extraction and photometry were performed using the psf fitting technique of the daophot software @xcite .
an empirical point spread function was constructed from the brightest objects found in our mosaic , and it was subsequently fitted to all the sources detected in the map . allowing for multiple - match fitting to deal with blended cases , we derived the flux density of each source from the scaled fitted psf and finally applied a slight correction to account for the finite size of the modeled point spread function .
we also performed extensive simulations adding and recovering artificial sources in the data , which allowed us to derive an 80% completeness limit at @xmath083@xmath1jy .
contamination by false sources appears in our detection catalog at fluxes fainter than 90@xmath1jy . in the full sample of objects
brighter than the 80% completeness limit , we estimate such a contamination to be around  0.6% .
a more detailed description of our technique is presented by @xcite who also discuss the evolution of the completeness limit and the false source fraction as a function of the flux at 24@xmath1 m ( see their figure  1 ) .
distortion effects are efficiently removed by the dat .
the final astrometric uncertainty of the mosaics produced by the pipeline therefore originates from the pointing reconstruction . to quantify this uncertainty in our data ,
we cross - identified the brightest sources detected at 24@xmath1 m with the _ two micron all sky survey _ ( 2mass ) catalog @xcite .
a systematic offset of @xmath00.6  was observed in the scan direction and subsequently removed for our source catalog to match the 2mass coordinates .
we estimate that the remaining scatter relative to 2mass is better than 0.3@xmath42  rms .
to derive the redshifts of the mips 24@xmath1m  selected sources , we retrieved from the literature publicly available catalogs of optical spectroscopic surveys in the cdfs such as the `` vimos vlt deep survey '' ( hereafter vvds , * ? ? ?
* ) , the eso / fors2 survey performed by the goods legacy team @xcite , and the follow - up of x - ray sources described by @xcite . the vvds consortium has released redshifts for 1599 sources located in an area of 21@xmath1221.6arcmin@xmath41 with an overall redshift measurement completeness of @xmath088% down to @xmath43 . for each identification ,
a flag indicates the reliability level of the corresponding measurement ; 1457 sources in this survey are classified with more than 75% confidence in the redshift determination .
the goods catalog provides 234 redshifts obtained within a slightly smaller area of the cdfs ( 10@xmath1215arcmin@xmath41 ) .
they are also tentatively classified into three categories depending on their reliability , and 150 sources in this catalog are thought to have a secure redshift measurement .
finally , @xcite present a spectroscopic follow - up of _ chandra _ x - ray sources , with redshifts obtained for 168 objects . among those ,
126 are considered to have unambiguous identifications .
we combined the catalogs of these three optical surveys to create a single list of 1941 spectroscopic redshifts with their corresponding flags .
because of some overlap between the different observed regions , several redshifts were sometimes assigned to a given single source . in case of discrepant estimates
, we kept the one flagged with the highest confidence in the redshift measurement .
the mips image at 24@xmath1 m entirely covers the areas observed by these spectroscopic surveys .
the vvds and goods fields of view can be seen in figure1 .
in addition to the spectroscopic redshifts previously described , we also made extensive use of the photometric redshifts from the combo-17 survey (  _ classifying objects by medium - band observations in 17 filters _ 
combo-17 observed a 31.5@xmath1230arcmin@xmath41 region of the cdfs ( see fig.1 ) through a set of 5 broad - band and 12 narrow - band filters , which allowed the determination of accurate spectral energy distributions ( seds ) and absolute magnitudes for several thousand optically - selected sources ( see also * ? ? ?
each sed was analyzed using a library of representative templates for various spectral types , and a redshift probability distribution was subsequently derived for each source . for a total of 24217  objects ,
these distributions were successfully fitted with gaussian - like functions , the mean and the variance of which led to well - constrained estimates of photometric redshifts with corresponding uncertainties .
these redshifts are accurate to 1% in @xmath44 for galaxies with @xmath45  21mag , and they are mostly reliable ( i.e. , @xmath46 ) for all sources at @xmath2@xmath41.2 and brighter than @xmath3@xmath024mag ( 11422  objects ) .
the yield of high weight redshifts drops steeply for @xmath2@xmath61.2 or @xmath3@xmath624mag , so we did not consider such faint or distant objects .
another redshift estimate is also provided for nearly every detection of the survey ( 62366  sources ) based on the peak of the computed probability distribution .
because it is less reliable , it should be used with caution @xcite and was therefore also not considered in this work . about @xmath085% of the region covered by combo-17 overlaps with our mips 24@xmath1 m mosaic and the spectroscopic optical surveys .
this overlapping area has a total field of view of 775arcmin@xmath41 ( see fig.1 ) .
from the full mips catalog we first selected the 24@xmath1 m sources located in the common area covered by _ spitzer _ and the aforementioned optical redshift surveys ( i.e. , 775arcmin@xmath41 ) .
in this region of overlap we detected 5589  objects at 24@xmath1 m , with 3616 of those having a flux greater than the 80% completeness limit of 83@xmath1jy .
we cross - correlated this 24@xmath1 m sub - sample with the optical data using a tolerance radius of 2  for matching sources .
this choice was first motivated by the rather large fwhm of the mips 24@xmath1 m psf ( @xmath06 ) compared to that typically seen in optical images . as already observed in local interacting systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?
* ; * ? ? ?
* ; * ? ? ?
* ) , it also accounts for the physical shift that could be present between the location of the infrared emission and the brightest optical component of distant mergers ( 2  corresponds to a linear projection of @xmath015kpc on the sky at @xmath2@xmath01 ) .
it is yet reasonably small given the position accuracy of the source centroids at 24@xmath1 m ( better than 0.5  rms ) . taking a larger value also increases the risk of associating mips sources with wrong optical counterparts in the case of multiple matches . when a double match was found , we selected the closest object .
we ignored the cases where three or more optical sources could be associated with a given 24@xmath1 m detection .    we first correlated the 24@xmath1 m source catalog with the list of spectroscopic redshifts .
a total of 543  matches was found in this cross - identification , of which 465  objects are flagged to have a high - confidence redshift measurement .
the fraction of multiple matches was only 1% . at this stage
, we only kept the identifications with a secure redshift determination .
those 465  sources represent only 8% of the infrared - selected sub - sample , which emphasizes the critical need for using photometric redshifts . we thus cross - correlated the rest of the data with the catalog of combo-17 .
we found 2170  mips sources ( 1987 single and 183 double matches ) identified with a photometric redshift below @xmath2=1.2 and an optical counterpart brighter than @xmath3=24mag . for 9  objects selected at 24@xmath1 m ( less than 0.5% of the sample ) three possible matches
were found within 2  around the mips source .
they were not further considered . in total , we assembled a catalog of 2635 mips sources ( of which 1962 are brighter than the 80% completeness limit of the 24@xmath1 m survey ) associated either with a reliable spectroscopic redshift or a clearly - constrained photometric redshift . virtually all are at @xmath2@xmath41.2 , since the yield of values at higher redshift is very low with both spectroscopy ( due to the `` redshift desert '' ) and combo-17 .
we also identified another set of 1681 mips sources with an optical counterpart in the combo-17 catalog but without any reliable redshift ( 271 of them have @xmath5@xmath2183@xmath1jy and are brighter than @xmath3=24mag ) .
since only a very small fraction of the mips sources have been identified with secure spectroscopic redshifts , it is worth looking at the typical uncertainties of the other _ photometric _ redshifts characterizing the 24@xmath1m - selected sources .
the accuracy of the combo-17 classification decreases for sources fainter than @xmath3@xmath022mag .
this may have non - negligible effects when estimating e.g. , source densities as a function of lookback time , especially when the uncertainties become comparable to the redshift bins in which galaxy properties are averaged .
given that the 24@xmath1 m sample is by definition selected through the emission by warm dust , one may furthermore question whether the implied extinction at optical wavelengths can lead to a more significant redshift mis - classification in the specific case of the most luminous ( i.e. , dust - obscured ) mips sources .    in figures2a &  2b
we compare high - confidence spectroscopic redshifts of optically - selected field galaxies and mips 24@xmath1 m detections with their photometric redshifts estimated by combo-17 .
we see that the photometric redshift errors are small ( i.e. , @xmath47-@xmath48@xmath40.1 ) and they are not statistically larger in the case of the mips sources .
the latter can be explained as follows .
mid - infrared space - borne and ground - based observations of local lirgs / ulirgs reveal that the dust responsible for the bulk of the ir luminosity of those objects originates from very compact regions @xcite .
the effect of extinction in these dusty systems is therefore very localized and is usually not apparent in the global spectral energy distribution of their optical counterparts @xcite .
a similar situation likely pertains at higher redshifts up to at least @xmath2@xmath01 . at @xmath2@xmath00.7 for instance ,
isocam  15@xmath1 m and mips  24@xmath1m - selected galaxies are indeed associated with luminous optical sources characterized by a wide range of optical colors and morphologies ( @xcite , bell et al .
2005 ; see also sect.6 ) .
only a careful approach based on medium - resolution spectroscopy can distinguish them from the optically - selected galaxy population ( e.g. , * ? ? ?
it is therefore unlikely to encounter any significant increase of redshift mis - classification _ as a function of infrared luminosity _
( at least up to @xmath2@xmath01 ) .     0.2 cm .2 cm    finally , fig.2c shows the photometric redshift uncertainties provided by the combo-17 catalog as a function of the observed @xmath3-band magnitude for the mips sources considered in this paper .
these errors were determined as the square root of the variance characterizing the redshift probability distribution of each object . in agreement with the comparison we made from fig.2a using the spectroscopic sub - sample
, we see that sources brighter than @xmath3@xmath022mag have a very accurate redshift estimate ( i.e. , @xmath49@xmath40.04 ) and most of the sample ( 88% ) is characterized by a redshift accuracy better than @xmath49@xmath00.1 .
the average uncertainty is only @xmath50@xmath51@xmath52=0.07 with a dispersion @xmath53=0.05 for sources with 22mag@xmath9@xmath54@xmath924mag .
it rises to @xmath50@xmath51@xmath52=0.09 ( with a similar dispersion ) if we only consider objects fainter than @xmath3@xmath023mag . looking at the evolution of the mips sources
averaged per redshift bin of @xmath55@xmath2@xmath00.2 should lead therefore to rather robust results .
the biggest concern affecting our results is the incompleteness of the redshift determination for the most distant sources considered in this paper .
as previously mentioned , 3616 objects were detected by mips above the 80% completeness limit in the region overlapping with the optical surveys of the cdfs , while our final catalog only contains 1962 sources with @xmath56@xmath2183@xmath1jy and a redshift identification ( i.e. , @xmath055% ) . to better
assess this effect , we plot in figure  3.a the fraction of mips sources characterized either by a spectroscopic or a photometric redshift as a function of the observed 24@xmath1 m flux ( solid line ) as well as the fraction of their identification with an optical counterpart for various magnitude limits ( shaded regions ) . at the highest fluxes ( i.e. , @xmath57 1mjy ) ,
the incompleteness of the sample is mostly due to a few objects detected close to very bright stars blooming the optical image and where a reliable identification of the counterpart can not be obtained .
these cases should not introduce any bias in our results .
below 1mjy , the drop in the redshift determination completeness corresponds to sources fainter than @xmath3@xmath023.5mag ( see also fig.3.b ) . above the 80% completeness limit of our mips data ( i.e. , 83@xmath1jy ) , we see for instance that a significant fraction ( @xmath025% ) of the mips objects with no redshift are associated with 24mag@xmath4@xmath3@xmath425.5mag sources , while @xmath020% of them have counterparts fainter than @xmath3@xmath625.5mag . this also indicates that a complete study of the faint mips population will likely require an extensive use of photometric redshift techniques .
the consequence of this limitation can be seen by comparing the redshift determination completeness as a function of the @xmath3-band magnitude with the distribution of the @xmath3-band magnitudes of the mips sources for different redshift limits .
this is shown in fig.3.b , while fig.3.c represents the absolute @xmath3-band magnitudes of the mips sources as a function of redsfhit and derived from combo-17 .
we see that the identification should be nearly complete up to @xmath2@xmath00.8 , but we start missing 24@xmath1 m objects located at higher redshift and associated with optical counterparts fainter than @xmath3@xmath023.524mag .
these mis - identifications likely induce a biais against the faintest sources detected at 24@xmath1 m .
in sect.6 we will establish a correlation between the optical and the infrared luminosities of galaxies in our sample , and we will use such relation in sect.7 to quantify how this bias affects the estimates of luminosity functions ( see also the appendix for further details characterizing these faint 24@xmath1 m sources ) .
however , given the importance of the cosmic variance arising from the variations of large scale structures in the cdfs ( see sect.3.4 ) , and taking into account the errors in the @xmath25-corrections used to derive ir  luminosities ( see sect.5 ) , we infer that the possible missing redshift determinations should not dominate the _
absolute _ uncertainty in the source density estimate up to @xmath2@xmath01 .
.3 cm    0.2 cm .2 cm
[ fig : z_distrib ]    other arguments also suggest that the bulk of the mips sources for which we could not identify any reliable redshift should be indeed located at @xmath2@xmath61 and will not affect this study .
first we will show in the following sections that infrared luminous galaxies are associated with optical counterparts at the bright end of the luminosity function in the visible .
luminous optical sources with l@xmath6l@xmath58 but fainter than @xmath3@xmath023.524mag should lie at @xmath2@xmath61 @xcite .
moreover , preliminary results from @xmath59 reveal that a significant fraction of the mips sources are located at such large redshifts @xcite . finally ,
although they are not fully reliable , the combo-17 redshift estimates based on the peak of the redshift probability distributions indicate that the majority of the sources that we have not identified should be at @xmath2@xmath61 .
figure4 shows the distribution of the redshifts derived for our sample of infrared sources ( bottom panel , solid line ) .
it is compared to the redshift distributions of the vvds ( dotted line ) and the combo-17 objects with @xmath60 ( dashed line ) .
as previously discussed , the redshift identification of the mips sources is complete only up to @xmath2@xmath00.8 , and the distribution beyond this limit should thus be considered as a lower limit estimate .
.3 cm    0.2 cm .2 cm [ fig : z_distrib ]    we note that the three distributions ( i.e. , mips , vvds , combo-17 ) are more or less similar from @xmath2@xmath00 to @xmath2@xmath01 . up to this redshift limit , mips is indeed sensitive to sources luminous in the infrared but also to more normal galaxies ( see sect.5 ) such as those detected at optical wavelengths and driving the vvds and combo-17 redshift distributions .
furthermore , we note a significant number of objects around @xmath2@xmath00.65 , apparent in all the distributions .
this originates from an overdensity characteristic of the cdfs near this redshift ( e.g. , * ? ? ?
* ) and it is likely related to cosmic variance and large - scale structure effects @xcite .
it may constitute a non negligible source of uncertainty in our density estimates .
a comparison between the integrated @xmath61-band luminosity densities as a function of redshift from galaxies of the blue sequence ( bell , private communication , see willmer et al .
, in prep .
, for the evolution of the blue sequence luminosity function ) in the cdfs and averaged over the three fields of combo-17 @xcite shows that the cdfs is most often underdense by @xmath050% at 0@xmath621 , except indeed at @xmath2@xmath00.65@xmath230.1 where the overdensity reaches @xmath020% . given the similarity between the redshift distributions of the optically and infrared selected sources , and since most of mips sources at @xmath2@xmath00.7 appear to be associated with large spirals dominating the @xmath61-band emission ( bell et al . 2005 , see also fig.10b ) , this cosmic variance characterized from the @xmath61-band luminosity density is likely affecting also the population of galaxies detected at 24@xmath1 m .
therefore the apparent peak at @xmath2@xmath00.65 in the mips redshift distribution is probably only related to the structure of the cdfs and it should not be a characteristic of the general population of infrared - selected sources .    in spite of the similarities that we observe between the redshift distributions in the visible and the infrared , a more critical look reveals that the fraction of optical sources brighter than m@xmath63=16 and detected at 24@xmath1 m decreases from @xmath2=0 to @xmath2@xmath00.4 and then increases with redshift up to @xmath2@xmath01 ( see fig.4 .
, top panel ) . interpreting this trend is not straightforward , but it could reflect the difference in the @xmath25-correction effects observed at optical and infrared wavelengths . as we will see in sect.5
( see figs.7 &  9 ) the effective sensitivity of the deep 24@xmath1 m observations drops rapidly from @xmath2=0 to @xmath2@xmath00.5 , which explains the sharp decrease of relative 24@xmath1 m detections in this redshift range .
then it remains roughly constant at 0.5@xmath4@xmath2@xmath40.9 because of strong emission features present at 11.3 and 12.7@xmath1 m in galaxy spectra progressively entering the 24@xmath1 m filter at these redshifts .
since the sensitivity of the optical data constantly drops with distance , an increase in the relative number of 24@xmath1 m sources detected beyond @xmath2@xmath00.5 in the visible might thus result .
note that it may also reflect the stronger evolution of ir sources with lookback time , since ir - luminous phases in galaxies were more common in the past ( e.g. , * ? ? ?
the lack of apparent decline moreover suggests that the intrinsic peak of the mips population redshift distribution must lie at least beyond @xmath2@xmath00.8 .
finally , another overdensity lies at @xmath2@xmath00.15 .
it represents a rather small fraction of our detections at 24@xmath1 m ( i.e. , 4% ) . since we will only consider sources at @xmath2@xmath210.3 when building the luminosity functions in sect.7 , it will not affect our final results on the evolution of the ir  galaxy population
using our matched catalog of 24@xmath1m - selected objects with redshifts , we now explore for various redshift slices the contribution of these mips sources to the total differential number counts .
our goal is a better understanding of the origin of the bump detected at 0.20.4mjy ( p04 , * ? ? ?
figure5 illustrates these cumulative source counts for redshift limits of 0.3 , 0.5 , 0.8 , 1.0 and 1.2 along with the global contribution of the mips sources identified with an optical counterpart in the full combo-17 catalog ( i.e. , @xmath3@xmath425.5mag ) .
the distributions for redshift limits @xmath2=1 and @xmath2=1.2 are likely underestimated due to the incompleteness of the sample as showed in sect.3.3 .
however , uncertainties due to cosmic variance likely dominate here ( @xmath00.10 - 0.15dex based on the ratio between the @xmath61-band luminosity densities of the cdfs and averaged within the other fields of combo-17 ) . for comparison
, we also represent the total 24@xmath1 m number counts derived from our sub - sample as well as those obtained by @xcite , who averaged the 24@xmath1 m source population over @xmath010deg@xmath41 in several cosmological fields . for consistency with our data ,
these counts from p04 were not corrected for incompleteness of the mips detections at faint fluxes .
.3 cm    0.2 cm .2 cm [ fig : z_distrib ]    we note that the 24@xmath1 m number counts derived in the cdfs show a roughly good agreement with those obtained by p04 below @xmath5@xmath00.2mjy
. however , the density of 24@xmath1 m cdfs sources at higher fluxes appears to be slightly lower ( @xmath020% ) , and consequently the peak of the differential number counts seems to occur at fainter levels . as previously seen in sect.3.4 .
, such variations are easily understood in terms of cosmic variance and the smaller number of infrared - bright sources in the cdfs is likely related to the underdensity observed in the @xmath61-band at @xmath2@xmath41 .    at critical fluxes @xmath5@xmath00.2 - 0.4mjy where the 24@xmath1 m differential counts present a turn - over , sources lying at @xmath2@xmath41 contribute @xmath055% to the whole sample .
even though this fraction could be slightly higher due to the possible incompleteness of our redshift identification at 0.8@xmath4@xmath2@xmath41 , a significant part of the mips population should therefore be located at higher redshifts ( i.e. , @xmath2@xmath61 ) . as already derived from fig.3
, it can also be noted that @xmath020% of the 24@xmath1 m sources have optical counterparts fainter than @xmath3@xmath025.5mag .      in figure6
we compare the differential counts in four redshift slices between @xmath2=0 and @xmath2=1.2 with the predictions from the models of ir galaxy evolution proposed by @xcite , @xcite , ( * ? ? ?
* , see also pozzi et al .
2004 ) and @xcite .
these models are all tied to the local ir galaxy population but differ in ( i ) the description of its components and their global properties ( i.e. , seds , luminosity functions per object type ) and ( ii ) the assumptions and parameterization used to infer the backward evolution of ir sources .
they provide a reasonably good fit to the total 24@xmath1 m number counts .
they also reproduce a variety of other observables such as the ir background , the counts and/or the redshift distributions of the @xmath14 and scuba galaxy populations .
.3 cm    0.2 cm .2 cm
[ fig : z_distrib ]    looking at their predictions for the 24@xmath1 m number counts within the redshift slices considered in this fig.6 , we see that the models from @xcite , @xcite and @xcite may underestimate the contribution of faint sources at 0@xmath4@xmath2@xmath40.8 but predict too many bright objects at @xmath2@xmath60.5 .
@xcite , on the other hand , closely follow the observations at @xmath2@xmath40.5 but might globally underestimate the source density at 0.5@xmath4@xmath2@xmath40.8 . all these models finally seem to overpredict the contribution of bright galaxies at @xmath2@xmath60.8 .
however we also note that these comparisons could be undermined given not only cosmic variance effects and the global underdensity of the cdfs between @xmath2=0 and @xmath2@xmath01 but also the incompleteness of our redshift identification at @xmath2@xmath60.8 .    comparisons with other models in the literature such as those published before the launch of @xmath59 lead to larger discrepancies .
these models tend to predict the characteristic turn - over of the differential 24@xmath1 m number counts at much higher fluxes than where it has been observed ( see for instance figure3 of @xcite ) .
the rest - frame mid - infrared ( mir ) regime ( i.e. , 8@xmath1 m @xmath6440@xmath1 m ) is considered to be a good tracer of the bolometric luminosity of galaxies . using the 12@xmath1 m iras galaxy sample ,
@xcite first showed that the relative dust content of galaxies balances their total energetic output between the optical and the far - infrared , leaving a `` pivot point '' in the mir where the specific luminosity linearly scales with the bolometric one .
more recently , a similar conclusion has been reached by @xcite who found a tight correlation between the 15@xmath1 m and the total infrared luminosities for a sample of normal and luminous sources studied with isocam . based on these considerations and taking into account the general ir / submm color - color and/or luminosity - color correlations observed in the local universe , several authors have built libraries of luminosity- or color - dependent galaxy templates , which can then be used to estimate the total infrared luminosity of galaxies from their 24@xmath1 m flux densities @xcite .
figure7 shows the total infrared luminosity that can be detected in our survey down to a 24@xmath1 m sensitivity limit of 0.08mjy , as a function of redshift and computed with the aforementioned libraries .
provided these templates are still representative of high redshift sources , we see that mips can easily detect normal starbursts ( i.e. , l@xmath65@xmath410@xmath7l@xmath8 ) up to @xmath2@xmath01 , and lirgs up to @xmath2@xmath01.5 .
note that such limits only characterize a pure selection of sources at 24@xmath1 m , and the use of _ a priori _ information from detections at other wavelengths can allow the identification of mips sources with similar infrared luminosities at even higher redshift ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?
the 80% completeness level roughly corresponds to a 5@xmath66 detection in the mips data @xcite , and the quoted 0.08mjy limit is therefore rather conservative .
figure7 also shows the dispersion between the predictions ( and therefore the templates ) of the various libraries ( see also * ? ? ?
for a given observable ( e.g. , infrared luminosity , color ,  ... ) these libraries assign a unique sed that slightly varies from one set of templates to another .
such variations reflect an intrinsic dispersion of the different correlations observed between the mir / fir / submm properties of galaxies that is usually not taken into account ( but see * ? ? ?
* for the use of bi - variate luminosity functions addressing this issue ) .
as an example , we compare in figure8 the observed relation between l@xmath67 and the monochromatic 15@xmath1 m luminosity l@xmath68=@xmath69 , with @xmath70 the monochromatic flux of the galaxy expressed in whz@xmath36 . ] for a sample of local galaxies studied with @xmath14 and iras @xcite with the predictions of the template libraries considered in fig.7 .
we see that the dispersion can easily reach @xmath00.2dex .
.3 cm    0.2 cm .2 cm [ fig : z_distrib ]    to explain this dispersion , one may note that in the local universe the mid - infrared seds of starburst sources with comparable bolometric luminosities are subject to significant variations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?
* ) . in the rest - frame wavelength range probed by the mips 24@xmath1 m filter for high redshift galaxies
, the mir emission results from the combination of prominent broad - band features mostly observed between 3 and 14@xmath1 m and usually denoted the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons bands ( pahs ) , superimposed on a rising continuum of very small grains ( vsgs ) stochastically heated by the young star radiation field ( see e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .
pahs present an amazingly universal sed signature as a global set of features when integrated over normal spiral galaxies ( @xcite , but see @xcite for smaller scale variations and a newly - discovered 17.1@xmath1 m pah in ngc7331 ) .
however , they are not detected in low metallicity sources ( * ? ? ?
* ; * ? ? ?
* ; engelbracht et al .
2005 , submitted ) .
they are also believed to be destroyed within intense radiation fields as in the vicinity of active galactic nuclei ( agn , e.g. , * ? ? ?
finally , the temperature of the vsgs as well as the silicate absorptions at 9.7@xmath1 m and 18@xmath1 m represent other important factors shaping the underlying continuum of the global mid - infrared sed of galaxies .
all of these variations can therefore bring significant uncertainties in relating the mir emission to the full infrared range of galaxy seds .
.3 cm    0.2 cm .2 cm
[ fig : z_distrib ]    furthermore , one may question whether these templates derived from the properties of local galaxies are trully representative of higher redshift sources .
infrared luminous galaxies detected by isocam at a median redshift of @xmath00.7 are characterized by roughly half - solar metallicites @xcite , which could point to ir seds slightly different from those of local lirgs .
however , pahs are still detected at this metallicity range in nearby starbursts ( engelbracht et al .
2005 , submitted ) .
moreover , the 24/15@xmath1 m flux ratios observed in @xmath2@xmath00.7 isocam sources still argue for the presence of significant pahs in their seds @xcite , and prominent pah features were also recently observed with the infrared spectrograph on _ spitzer _ ( irs , * ? ? ?
* ) at even higher redshifts ( i.e. , 1.7@xmath9@xmath2@xmath92.8 , * ? ? ?
we also note that the mir / radio relation expected from the mir / fir and fir / radio correlations observed locally @xcite appears to be still valid in the more distant universe ( e.g. , * ? ? ?
* ; * ? ? ?
these results give reasonable confidence in using local galaxy templates to estimate the infrared luminosities of distant ir sources .
for each library of seds previously discussed , we computed the redshift - dependent relations between l@xmath65 and the flux density observed at 24@xmath1 m . for every source of the sample , an estimate of the total ir luminosity
was thus obtained from each set of templates .
these measures were weigthed based on the accuracy of their associated library to reproduce the observed relation between l@xmath67 and l@xmath68 at the derived luminosity ( see fig.8 ) .
they were combined to provide the final infrared luminosity of the object , and their associated rms was taken as an estimate of the corresponding uncertainty .
as noted by @xcite there might also be a bias of mips 24@xmath1 m sources toward luminous galaxies with hot dust temperatures compared to the whole population of ir - luminous objects at high redshift .
this could result in additional systematics affecting these luminosity estimates , and we have not formally considered this effect here .
we believe however that the uncertainties due to the sed libraries dominate the systematics in our study .
the ir luminosities are displayed as a function of redshift in figure  9 .
based on the previous arguments we estimate that they are accurate within a factor of @xmath023 up to @xmath2@xmath01 .
we see that most sources detected below @xmath2@xmath00.5 are only modest infrared emitters ( i.e. , l@xmath67@xmath910@xmath7l@xmath8 ) , and the number of infrared - luminous galaxies found at these low redshifts is quite low . at larger distances
however , lirgs represent a significant fraction of the mips galaxy sample in terms of detection number .
this large population of lirgs at 0.5@xmath4@xmath2@xmath41.0 has also been observed in various surveys performed at 15@xmath1 m with isocam ( e.g. , * ? ? ?
* ; * ? ? ?
* ; * ? ? ?
we finally note that the most luminous galaxies ( i.e. , l@xmath67@xmath2110@xmath11l@xmath8 ) are still pretty rare , but there is a clear hint for an increase of the number of the brightest lirgs ( 5@xmath1210@xmath7l@xmath8@xmath4l@xmath67@xmath910@xmath11l@xmath8 ) at @xmath2@xmath01 , which could point to a large population of ulirgs at even larger distances ( i.e. , @xmath2@xmath61.5 , @xcite ) .
these detection rates are obviously contingent on the comoving volume sampled at each redshift though .
this general issue will thus be addressed in more detail in sect.7 , where we characterize the evolution of the infrared luminosity function based on this sample of mips sources .
0.2 cm .2 cm    as a final remark , it is worth mentioning another possible caveat related to these infrared luminosity estimates .
the various template libraries that we used in this work are only representative of normal and starburst - like galaxies , and do not include the seds typical of active galactic nuclei which are significantly flatter in the mir wavelength range .
a careful investigation of the nature of the emission process dominating the 24@xmath1 m flux in our sub - sample ( star - forming activity versus agn ) is beyond the scope of this paper , but we note that the fraction of mips sources showing evidence for the presence of an agn in their optical counterparts is less than @xmath015% according to the vvds and combo-17 classifications .
furthermore , recent synthetic models connecting the x - ray and infrared sed of agns as well as their contribution to the cosmic backgrounds in these energy bands indicate that the emission arising from pure agns should be negligible ( i.e. , @xmath410% ) in high redshift sources detected at 24@xmath1 m ( e.g. , * ? ? ?
* ) . in the local universe
moreover , agns dominate the mid - ir output of galaxies only for the most extreme ulirgs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?
* ; * ? ? ?
* ) , while the x - ray and optical spectral properties of infrared galaxies detected with @xmath14 and mips at 15@xmath1 m and 24@xmath1 m also argue for a population dominated by star formation at the @xmath08590% level @xcite .
it should therefore be reasonable to assume seds typical of star - forming galaxies for this current work .
we describe in this section a few basic characteristics of the mips source optical counterparts to provide a first - order answer to very simple questions : are the distant infrared luminous galaxies detected by mips also luminous in the optical or are they highly obscured  ? are these dusty starbursts associated with very young systems or already evolved galaxies  ?
a description of their morphologies , colors and specific star formation rates is provided by bell et al .
( 2005 ) .
the combo-17 @xmath3-band magnitudes of the mips sources are plotted as a function of the flux density at 24@xmath1 m in figure10a .
not surprisingly , there is a clear trend for the fainter 24@xmath1 m objects to be associated with faint optical sources likely located at higher redshifts .
such a trend has already been noted among the population of infrared galaxies detected with isocam at 15@xmath1 m ( e.g. , * ? ? ?
. however there is large dispersion in the relation and for most of the sample the optical brightnesses can vary by more than 5 magnitudes when infrared fluxes only change by less than a factor of 10 .
this clearly points to a very wide range of the l@xmath65/l@xmath71 ratios and a broad variety in the nature of the mips sources ( see also the appendix ) .
0.2 cm .2 cm    we also used the absolute magnitude estimates provided by combo-17 to derive the intrinsic luminosities of the mips sources at optical wavelengths . as an example we illustrate in figure10b the combo-17 absolute magnitudes estimated in the @xmath61-band filter and corrected to our cosmology=100  km  s@xmath36mpc@xmath36 , @xmath37=0.3 and @xmath38 . ] as a function of the total infrared luminosities derived in the previous section .
we observe a clear relationship between the two quantities , though the dispersion remains relatively large ( 1@xmath66@xmath00.5dex ) .
similar relations are also obtained between the total ir luminosity and the absolute magnitudes derived from the other broad - band filters of combo-17 .
they show that distant ir luminous sources ( at least up to @xmath2@xmath01 ) are preferentially associated with luminous optical counterparts as in the local universe @xcite .
this result confirms previous studies based on @xmath14 surveys @xcite .
it also suggests that the dust responsible for the ir excess in such distant ir - luminous objects is likely distributed within small - size regions and the corresponding reddening is not sufficient to completely obscure the underlying galaxy .
this interpretation is reinforced by the range of optical colors observed among the mips 24@xmath1 m source population , very similar to the range characterizing the local normal galaxies ( bell et al .
2005 ) .
combo-17 also provides an estimate of the rest - frame galaxy luminosity at @xmath27=2800 , which can be used to derive the `` ir excess '' in the mips sources .
ir excess is usually defined as the ratio between the ir and uv emission and it is plotted in figure10c as a function of the total ir luminosity .
owing to the tight relation between the star - forming activity and the ir emission of galaxies @xcite , this plot can also be read as the ir excess as a function of an `` ir - equivalent '' star formation rate ( an ir luminosity l@xmath65=10@xmath7l@xmath8 typically corresponds to a formation of @xmath017m@xmath8 of stars per year following standard calibrations ) .
it illustrates the very well - known trend for galaxies characterized by more intense star - forming activity to be generally dustier and more luminous at ir wavelengths ( e.g. , * ? ? ?
* ; * ? ? ?
* ; * ? ? ?
* ; * ? ? ?
we also see that the fraction of uv photons not absorbed by dust in the case of the most luminous sources ( i.e. , l@xmath67@xmath610@xmath72l@xmath8 ) is negligible compared to the energy reprocessed in the ir .
we finally provide an estimate of the stellar masses of the mips sources based on the properties of their optical counterparts .
a tight correlation exists between the rest - frame optical colors of galaxies and their mass - to - light ratios @xcite .
this relation is uncertain by a factor @xmath00.4dex due to combined effects of metallicity , dust , and history of star formation in individual sources .
it is however accurate enough for the purpose illustrated here ( i.e. , getting a qualitative estimate of the distribution of ir - luminous objects as a function of mass ) .
following the detailed analysis and recipes by ( * ? ? ?
* , see their appendix a ) , we used the @xmath73-band absolute luminosities of galaxies from combo-17 ( converted to our cosmology ) and transformed these luminosities to stellar masses using rest - frame @xmath74 colors .
figure10d illustrates the corresponding histograms for both samples of optically - selected sources ( thin solid line ) and of galaxies detected at 24@xmath1 m ( thick solid line ) .
it is very clear that ir galaxies detected by mips are on average more massive ( i.e. , @xmath75@xmath610@xmath76@xmath77 ) than the field population of sources selected at optical wavelengths .
furthermore , the 24@xmath1 m objects tend to be associated with even more massive galaxies when their ir luminosity ( and thus their star formation rate ) increases . as already observed in the case of 15@xmath1 m sources detected by @xmath14 at @xmath2@xmath41 @xcite , lirgs with l@xmath65@xmath610@xmath72l@xmath8 have most often counterparts with @xmath75@xmath610@xmath13@xmath77
. in sect.8 we will discuss this issue within the more general context of the comoving star - forming activity at @xmath2@xmath01 .
as a side note , we found a group of 91  sources ( among which 54 have @xmath56@xmath2183@xmath1jy ) identified with photometric redshifts and totally escaping the various relations illustrated on figs.10abc .
these objects are rather faint in the optical ( @xmath3@xmath623mag ) , and their @xmath5/@xmath78 flux ratios are particularly high and typical of lirgs / ulirgs . according to our previous results , and given that most of them have disturbed merger morphologies chatacteristic of high redshift star - forming galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?
* ) , they are thus likely located at @xmath2@xmath60.5 - 0.6 , which is also supported by their morphologies since many of those are chatacteristic of high redshift star - forming galaxies .
however they have been assigned very low redshifts by combo-17 , mostly in the apparent overdensity observed at @xmath2@xmath00.15 in the cdfs .
this would imply faint infrared luminosities ( 10@xmath79l@xmath8@xmath4l@xmath67@xmath410@xmath13l@xmath8 , see fig.9 ) and optical absolute magnitudes much higher ( @xmath80@xmath6@xmath81 ) than expected from the correlations .
we believe that these redshifts have probably been misidentified . we decided to exclude the corresponding sources from our sample .
we explore in this section the evolution of ir luminosity functions ( lfs ) at 0@xmath4@xmath2@xmath41.2 .
these lfs were derived for various redshift bins with the usual @xmath82 formalism @xcite applied to our sub - sample of sources brighter than @xmath83@xmath8483@xmath1jy and @xmath3=24mag .
the selection function that was used in this goal was computed as follows .
first , we considered the probability for a given object to verify our selection criterion at 24@xmath1 m .
this probability equals  1 for sources brighter than @xmath0300@xmath1jy but decreases at fainter fluxes due to the incompleteness of the 24@xmath1 m catalog .
the corresponding effect was quantified using the detailed simulations described by ( * ? ? ?
* , see their figure1 ) .
second , we estimated the probability for a 24@xmath1 m source to be associated with an optical counterpart at @xmath3@xmath924mag . this probability is a redshift - dependent function , and it can be derived with an estimate of the absolute magnitude corresponding to the optical selection criterion ( @xmath3=24mag ) combined with the relation between the infrared and the optical luminosities established in the previous section . at this step , we actually assumed that 100% of sources with @xmath3@xmath924mag are detected by combo-17 .
finally , we took into account the probability for a given optical source to be characterized by a redshift .
this was done using the estimate of the redshift identification completeness that we determined in sect.3.3 for sources at @xmath3@xmath924mag .
the computed selection function was subsequently used for each single galaxy of the sample to weight the differential volume elements that are integrated when calculating the total accessible volume @xmath85 . given the multi - wavelength flux limits considered here , this integration was performed up to the maximum redshift enabling the detection of the object at _ both _
24@xmath1 m _ and _ optical wavelengths ( i.e. , the lowest value between the redshift where the 24@xmath1 m flux would drop below 83@xmath1jy and the redshift where the @xmath3-band magnitude would reach 24mag ) .
the determination of the luminosity function was performed for each redshift range independently of the sources lying in the other bins .
for this reason , the @xmath86 approach is more subject to density fluctuations than other methods like the stepwise maximum likelihood ( e.g. , * ? ? ?
* ; * ? ? ?
even though cosmic variance is not negligible in cdfs , we will see however that the uncertainties affecting our conclusions are largely dominated by the errors on the @xmath25-corrections that are used to translate fluxes into luminosities .
the @xmath86 technique might also be sensitive to the photometric redshift uncertainties , but as we already pointed out in sect.3.2 , the effect should be negligible here given the accuracy of the combo-17 redshift classification .      from the luminosity- dependent templates
previously discussed , we converted the 24@xmath1 m observed fluxes into monochromatic luminosities at 12 , 15 , 25 and 60@xmath1 m as described in sect.5.2 .
the latter were subsequently used to derive the associated luminosity functions that we finally compared to the local lfs derived from @xmath87 and @xmath14 . in figure11
we illustrate the 15@xmath1 m lf @xmath88(l,@xmath2 ) estimated for different redshift bins .
the corresponding data points are reported in table1 . at this wavelength
the @xmath25-corrections needed to convert 24@xmath1 m fluxes into luminosities are minimized for most of the sources .
the majority of sources are indeed located at 0.5@xmath4@xmath2@xmath40.8 where the mips 24@xmath1 m filter probes the 13.516@xmath1 m rest - frame wavength range .
this behavior reduces the dependence of the luminosity functions on the assumed ir templates .
we also show in figure12 the total ir lfs @xmath89(l,@xmath2 ) computed from the infrared luminosities shown in fig.9 .
data points are given in table2 .
these lfs are obviously more dependent on the choice of ir seds since the uncertainty in the conversion between flux and luminosity is larger ( @xmath00.4dex ) .
they are however easier to interpret in the context of ir galaxy evolution .

this connection results in an obvious relation between the two that we already highlighted in sects.3.4 &  6 ( see fig.10b , see also bell et al .
the characterization of the @xmath61-band luminosity function over different fields can therefore be used to estimate a first - order correction and minimize the cosmic variance affecting our 24@xmath1 m sample . with its redshift peak at @xmath2@xmath00.65 ,
the cdfs is particularly subject to this effect .      for each luminosity bin in a given redshift range , uncertainties @xmath135
were estimated as the combination of ( i ) poisson noise statistics on the number of sources used in the measurement ( i.e. , the rms error @xmath136 , with `` k '' the source index in the bin ) and ( ii ) uncertainties in the flux density at 24@xmath1 m and the conversion into luminosities .
the effect of the latter was simulated with a monte carlo approach .
we assigned to each galaxy a range of luminosities ( monochromatic or integrated ) that were calculated by taking account of the nominal flux and uncertainty at 24@xmath1 m as well as the different possible seds for the conversion .
we found this conversion from flux to luminosity to be by far the dominant source of uncertainty , which explains the larger error bars found in the case of @xmath89 than for @xmath88 . regarding the monochromatic 15@xmath1 m lf however , flux uncertainties at 24@xmath1 m also contribute significantly , especially at the faintest levels . for each redshift bin
finally , we uniformly added another uncertainty ( 0.15dex ) to the whole luminosity function based on our estimate of the cosmic variance effect . because it should be negligible
, we did not simulate the effect related to photometric redshift uncertainties .      in both figures11 & 12
we have also illustrated the luminosity functions determined locally from @xmath87 and @xmath14 .
the 15@xmath1 m local lf @xmath137 was taken from @xcite and @xcite .
regarding the total ir luminosity function @xmath138 at @xmath2=0 , we show on one hand a recent result from the revised iras bright galaxy sample @xcite , on the other hand an estimate that we derived from the 60@xmath1 m local lf @xcite assuming the tight correlation between the 60@xmath1 m and the total ir luminosity of galaxies .
not surprisingly , these two estimates agree well with each other .
a commonly known characteristic of these ir luminosity functions is their relatively large number of sources at the bright end . as a result
they are better described by a double - exponential profile rather than a classical schechter parameterization .
their usual analytical form is given as follows :    @xmath139\nonumber\end{aligned}\ ] ]    where @xmath140 is the differential element of comoving volume and @xmath141 the number of sources with a luminosity @xmath142 within @xmath140 and per bin of @xmath143log@xmath144 .
as expected , the comparison between @xmath145(l,@xmath2 ) and the local luminosity functions reveals a very strong evolution of the lfs with lookback time . for each redshift bin , @xmath145(l,@xmath2 ) was fitted assuming a monotonic evolution of the local lf @xmath146 in both luminosity and density as a function of ( 1+@xmath2 ) :    @xmath147    with @xmath148 and @xmath149 .
we explored the possible range of values for the fitting parameters @xmath150 and @xmath151 using a @xmath152 minimization .
this @xmath152 was computed from the difference between the observed and the fitted luminosity functions over the 0.3@xmath9@xmath2@xmath91.0 redshift range :    @xmath153^{2}_{l_i , z_j}\ ] ]       because of their lower statistical significance , lfs determined at @xmath2@xmath90.3 and @xmath2@xmath211 were ignored in this process .
reduced @xmath152 values were finally transformed into likelihood estimates using log@xmath154 .
the corresponding 1@xmath66 , 2@xmath66 and 3@xmath66 iso - probability contours for @xmath88 and @xmath89 are displayed in the insets of figures11 &  12 respectively .
the elliptical shape and the orientation of these contours in the luminosity and density evolution parameter space reflect a well - known degeneracy often encountered when fitting high redshift luminosity functions .
given the sensitivity of our 24@xmath1 m survey indeed , the very faint - end portion of @xmath145(l,@xmath2 ) can not be constrained at any redshift .
the lf can thus be described with a variety of scenarios combining different amount of evolution in @xmath150 and @xmath151 .
the constraints that we obtained can be summarized as follows :    @xmath155    @xmath156          we will analyze in sect.7.4 how this degeneracy can be broken by taking account of other independent constraints . nonetheless we stress that the knee of the luminosity functions is well detected throughout the redshift range considered in this work ( i.e. , @xmath2@xmath41 ) .
this allows us to exclude a pure evolution of the lf in density ( i.e. , @xmath151=0 ) with a very high confidence .
because of the quasi - linearity between l@xmath68 and l@xmath65 @xcite , these constraints on the evolution of @xmath88 and @xmath89 should be in principle strictly similar . while they do agree rather well with each other , the extension of the contours reveal however that the evolution of the 15@xmath1 m lf seems to be better constrained than the evolution of @xmath89 .
as we already pointed out , lf uncertainties are largely dominated by the errors in the conversion between the 24@xmath1 m flux and the luminosities , and these errors are in fact minimized around 15@xmath1 m .
furthermore , we see that @xmath88 might be characterized by a stronger evolution in density and a smaller evolution in luminosity compared to @xmath89 . this discrepancy could be a consequence of the non - negligible dispersion that exists in the correlations observed between fluxes at mid- and far - infrared wavelengths ( e.g. , * ? ? ?
* ; * ? ? ?
* ; * ? ? ?
* ; * ? ? ?
indeed the templates that we used to extrapolate fluxes to luminosities do not really show a pure linear relation between l@xmath68 and l@xmath65 ( see fig.8 ) .
moreover , the constraints on @xmath157 and @xmath158 strongly depend on the assumed local luminosity functions , and the comparison between @xmath159 and @xmath160 ( that we used to compute @xmath161 ) clearly reveals a non - linearity between the two .
finally , it might be suggested that our scenario based on a single evolving population is overly simplistic . considering distinct object types characterized by their own evolution
@xcite , bi - variate lfs @xcite or luminosity functions only evolving at their bright end @xcite could be one way to explore this effect in more detail .    in spite of this apparent degeneracy
, it should be however noted that the evolution of the total luminosity density @xmath162 integrated from these infrared lfs is more tightly constrained than the evolution of the characteristic parameters @xmath163 and @xmath164 considered separately . in each redshift bin , mips can indeed detect those sources responsible for the bulk of the comoving luminosity density , and the additional uncertainty related to the extrapolation for taking account of the contribution of faint objects ( i.e. , faint - end slope of the lf , see sect.7.5 ) is therefore not dominant .
based on the relation that we obtained between @xmath151 and @xmath150 , we find that @xmath162 evolves as ( 1+@xmath2)@xmath20 at 0@xmath4@xmath2@xmath41 ( see also sect.8 and fig.14 ) .    finally , we tested the effect of our redshift identification incompleteness at @xmath2@xmath61 on the lf estimates by computing @xmath152 including the observed luminosity function determined at 1@xmath9@xmath2@xmath91.2 .
for both @xmath88 and @xmath89 the minimization of @xmath152 in this case leads to a short translation of the iso - probability contours toward smaller values of @xmath157 and larger values of @xmath158 compared to what we previously found .
this trend is consistent with expectations if @xmath165 is underestimated at @xmath2@xmath61 .
indeed the latter artificially yields a fainter evolution in density , the effect of which gets compensated in the lowest redshift bins thanks to a slight increase in luminosity . as a sanity check we finally computed @xmath152 also excluding the lf obtained at 0.8@xmath9@xmath2@xmath91 where we may also be missing a few 24@xmath1 m sources fainter than @xmath3@xmath024mag .
the results that we found remain consistent with those initially obtained .
@xcite combined constraints from source number counts at radio wavelengths with estimates of the comoving star formation rate ( sfr ) density of the universe at high redshift to break the degeneracy that also arises when quantifying the evolution of star - forming radio - selected galaxies .
following his method we investigate in this section how similar considerations can help in better constraining the evolution of ir galaxies .    up to @xmath2@xmath01 ,
the integrated star formation density per comoving volume of the universe @xmath166 is now well established within a factor of 2 to 3 @xcite . given
the relationship between the total ir emission of galaxies and their obscured sfr @xcite , the evolution of @xmath89 converted into a history of the total dusty star - forming activity must be therefore consistent with these constraints on @xmath166 .
we computed the `` ir - equivalent sfr '' as a function of redshift with different combinations of @xmath157 and @xmath158 .
the dispersion in the relation between the flux at 24@xmath1 m and the total ir luminosity obviously affects this estimate .
moreover we stress that it should only be a lower limit on the true sfr given the un - absorbed uv photons produced by young stars and not accounted for by the ir measurements ( e.g. , * ? ? ?
* , see also the l@xmath65/l@xmath167 ratio of the mips sources in fig.10c ) .
given these caveats and the additional uncertainty on @xmath166 mentioned above , we required our ir - sfr determination to lie within 0.5dex of the averaged relation between log@xmath168(@xmath166 ) and log@xmath169(1+@xmath2 ) derived by @xcite .
this constraint demarcates a specific region in the luminosity and density evolution parameter space , lying between the dashed and the dotted lines shown in the inset of figure12 . as we can see , the evolving parameters @xmath157 and @xmath158 that we derived from @xmath152 minimization in the previous section agree well with the known history of star formation up to @xmath2@xmath01 .
however we also note that this approach does not really help in solving the aforementioned degeneracy .
one may need a more accurate determination of @xmath166 to progress in this direction .
alternatively , a better constraint on the conversion between @xmath5 , l@xmath10 and sfr might provide in the future a more accurate determination of @xmath166 .
a much more interesting constraint can be obtained from the source number counts .
in fact we only considered 24@xmath1 m sources brighter than 83@xmath1jy when building the luminosity functions @xmath170 , but the counts at lower fluxes can be used to derive limits on the contribution of sources at luminosities fainter than those taken to minimize the @xmath152 . using the 24@xmath1 m observations of the `` goods test - field '' centered on elais - n1 ,
@xcite and @xcite constrained the faint source density down to @xmath5@xmath030@xmath1jy and showed that the differential counts normalized to the euclidian slope are likely dropping very rapidly below this limit .
we must therefore ensure that the evolution of the infrared lf does not lead to an overproduction of these counts at faint fluxes . to check the latter we derived as a function of @xmath157 and @xmath158 the differential number counts that would be produced up to @xmath2=1 by a population of sources described by @xmath170 and evolving as given by equation2 ( see fig.13 ) .
we rejected the solutions overproducing the total counts obtained from the goods test field at the faint end .
surprisingly we found that this constraint is nearly independent of the library of ir seds used to describe the galaxy population .
this excludes a region of the [ @xmath157,@xmath158 ] parameter space that is illustrated by the shaded area in the inset of figure12 .
this additional constraint reduces significantly the number of possibilities to describe the evolution of @xmath172 .
the best parameters quantifying this evolution at 0@xmath4@xmath2@xmath41 are given by @xmath173 and @xmath174 ( quoted uncertainty of 1@xmath66 ) .
they are summarized in table3 . in particular
they exclude any solution favoring a larger evolution in density than in luminosity .
this trend has already been reported by several groups using similar analysis with the @xmath14 and scuba number counts , and the overproduction of the background resulting from a too strong increase of @xmath175 is a well - known constraint on the backward evolutionary scenarios of ir galaxies .
it has also been noted with models assuming pure density evolution in the press schechter formalism @xcite .

the model predictions represented by the dashed line in fig.13 are consistent with the constraints imposed by the faint source counts but severely underestimate the true contribution of sources at @xmath2@xmath501 .
however we found that reproducing the bump observed at @xmath83@xmath00.3mjy is very dependent on the choice of seds , which could also explain why the pre - launch models had over - predicted the mips 24@xmath1 m number counts at these bright fluxes .
since our goal is to exclude unphysical solutions without being subject to the assumed seds , we did not consider further this information .
in the previous section we have constrained the knee and the bright end of the infrared luminosity function @xmath172 up to @xmath2@xmath01 .
as expected our results indicate a very strong evolution of this lf with lookback time .
we find that the space density of galaxies with l@xmath65@xmath2110@xmath7l@xmath22 at @xmath2@xmath01 exceeds by more than 100 their density in the local universe , which is in fairly good agreement with the results from @xmath14 .
the quantification of the evolution depends however _ very strongly _ on the mid- and far - ir seds used to compute the @xmath25-corrections .
this points to an urgent need for a more accurate characterization of infrared spectral energy distributions of normal and luminous galaxies .
this goal might be achieved by combining 24 , 70 and 160@xmath1 m broad - band mips imaging with infrared spectroscopy from the irs spectrograph and the mips `` sed mode '' .
given the limitations due to the uncertainties of our lf estimates , we do not find any evidence for a modification of the shape of @xmath89 relative to the local luminosity function at least in the luminosity range probed with mips .
obviously the density of sources fainter than the 80% completeness limit of the 24@xmath1 m survey is not directly constrained and we can not exclude a slight steepening of the lf faint - end slope at high redshifts . however , the weight of this lf by luminosity shows that the increase of energy produced by faint objects in the case of a steeper slope would be mostly driven by sources just below the knee of @xmath89 , the faintest ones having a negligible contribution in spite of their larger number .
the corresponding effect is then very similar to the one produced by a too large evolution of @xmath172 in density . as we saw in the previous section it would result in an overproduction of the number counts at faint fluxes and
violate therefore the constraints on the background .
while the steepening of @xmath89 at the faintest end can not be definitely ruled out , it must have marginal significance and will not affect our further discussion .
furthermore we do not notice any obvious break in the shape of the luminosity function @xmath172 .
contrary to our simple scenario that considers the mips detections as a single class of objects , these breaks can occur when the lf is decomposed into the contribution of several populations ( e.g. , starbursts , agns , cold galaxies ,  ... ) evolving independently with the redshift . as an example
, they can be observed in the model proposed by @xcite .
based on a simple decomposition of high redshift galaxies into normal non - evolving sources and starbursts undergoing strong evolution , this model had successfully reproduced previous ir / sub - mm observations from @xmath14 , scuba and cobe , but it fails in explaining the faint - end part of our luminosity functions because of a predicted break that is not observed ( see fig.12 ) . _ spitzer _ provides therefore new constraints on this kind of scenario , and our results suggest in this case a smooth transition between populations so that continuity is still observed in the total luminosity function .
this effect could be taken into account considering multi - variate luminosity functions @xcite .      over the last decade
cosmological surveys conducted with @xmath14 mainly at 15@xmath1 m , 90@xmath1 m and 170@xmath1 m provided direct evidence for the importance of infrared luminous sources at 0@xmath4@xmath2@xmath41 , while submillimeter observations with scuba revealed a very high density of dusty galaxies with l@xmath65@xmath2110@xmath11l@xmath22 at very high redshifts ( i.e. , @xmath2@xmath62 ) . number counts and redshift distributions that were derived from these surveys as well as the direct measurement of the far - infrared background by cobe
already allowed determination of some constraints on the evolution of the infrared energy density with redshift ( e.g. , * ? ? ?
* ; * ? ? ?
mips is however the first infrared instrument with good enough sensitivity to obtain a direct measurement of the mid - ir luminosity function up to @xmath2@xmath01 ( but see * ? ? ?
* ; * ? ? ?
* for lfs at intermediate redshifts ) .
it might therefore be worth comparing the constraints obtained from this work with earlier results from the literature .
first , our 24@xmath1 m survey not only excludes very clearly the possibility of a pure evolution of the ir luminosity function in @xmath189 , but it also reveals a much stronger evolution of @xmath190 in luminosity than in density ( i.e. , @xmath191 ) .
this trend confirms previous interpretations of long - wavelength surveys and implies that the contribution of dusty luminous galaxies was significantly more important in the past .
our evolution constraints ( i.e. , @xmath192@xmath16(1+@xmath2)@xmath193 and @xmath175@xmath16(1+@xmath2)@xmath194 ) show good agreement with previously published analysis ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?
* ; * ? ? ?
* ; * ? ? ?
* ; * ? ? ?
* ; * ? ? ?
however our data do not seem to be consistent with a luminosity evolution stronger than @xmath195 as in several scenarios examined by @xcite and @xcite , unless one adds a decrease in density ( @xmath196 ) .
our analysis moreover agrees with the constraints on the lfs of star - forming galaxies recently derived from the radio sub - mjy source number counts and the history of star formation .
an evolution slightly lower than our estimate ( @xmath197 ) has been obtained with this approach by @xcite , but it is still consistent with our results within the large uncertainties . the small discrepancy could also originate from the likely different levels of agn contamination characterizing populations selected at 24@xmath1 m and at radio wavelengths .    while our results on the mid- and total ir luminosity functions are still consistent with each other , we finally note that our constraints on @xmath88 seem to require a stronger evolution in density and a smaller evolution in luminosity compared to @xmath89 .
we have not yet understood whether this trend is physically real and reveals the need for a more complex evolutionary scenario than the one we have assumed , or whether it is artificially produced by the infrared seds used to compute luminosities .
interestingly , the need for a strong evolution of the mid - ir lf in density has also been suggested by @xcite based on the elais 15@xmath1 m surveys ( see also * ? ? ?
a direct comparison between our analysis and their results must however be done with caution .
@xcite decomposed their sample into the contribution of non - evolving galaxies that dominate the 15@xmath1 m counts at low redshift , and distant starbursts responsible for the increase of the ir energy density .
given the negligible role of these starbursts at @xmath2@xmath00 , their evolution must be therefore stronger than that of the global sample .
this may explain why the evolving parameters that they derived are slightly larger than ours ( i.e. , @xmath198 ) .
note that this approach was also used by @xcite and led to a qualitatively similar trend .
the constraints on the evolution of @xmath172 can be used to derive the relative importance of galaxies in a given luminosity range and how their contribution to the star formation history evolves with redshift . using the fit and the parameterization discussed in the previous section we compare in figure14 the evolution of the ir energy density @xmath162 produced by infrared luminous galaxies ( i.e. , lirgs@xmath199ulirgs ) and fainter sources ( i.e. , l@xmath65@xmath5010@xmath7l@xmath22 ) .
uncertainties affecting our results are still significant due to the degeneracy previously described .
accordingly the range of possible solutions was estimated from the 3@xmath66 iso - probability contours showed in figure12 excluding the combinations of @xmath157 and @xmath158 that overproduce the counts at faint fluxes .
0.2 cm .2 cm [ fig : z_distrib ]    this evolution is also represented in terms of an `` ir - equivalent sfr '' using the calibration from @xcite . for comparison
we show integrated star formation rate densities estimated in various redshift bins and taken from the literature ( see the compilation by @xcite for references ) .
it should be noted that we have not estimated the contribution of the agn ir emission to @xmath162 . following the arguments discussed in sect.5.2
, we believe that such contribution results in a 1015% overestimate in the true sfr . on the other hand
this ir - sfr estimate does not take into account the contribution of the unabsorbed uv light produced by the young stars .
as a result we are likely underestimating the total star formation rate density by a factor ranging between @xmath02030% at @xmath2@xmath01 ( where dusty galaxies dominate the sfr ) and @xmath06070% at @xmath2@xmath00 ( where the star - forming activity occurs within fainter sources with low extinction )
. this effect can be seen by considering , in addition to the ir emission , the evolution of the uv luminosity ( uncorrected for dust extinction ) with redshift .
using galex data , @xcite found that the energy density measured at 1500   evolves as ( 1+@xmath2)@xmath200 at 0@xmath4@xmath2@xmath41 , which is also consistent with previous uv measurements ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .
an estimate of the total star formation rate density ( represented as a dotted line in fig.14 ) can thus be obtained by adding the contribution of the equivalent uv - uncorrected sfr ( dashed line in fig.14 ) to our best fit of the evolution of the ir star formation estimate ( converted from the energy density @xmath162 evolving as ( 1+@xmath2)@xmath201 ) .
this clearly shows that the ir emission provides a good approximation of the total sfr density at @xmath2@xmath01 given the uncertainties affecting its current measurements ( i.e. , conversion between flux and luminosity , cosmic variance ) .
one can see that the global evolution of the luminosity function leads to a source density increase for both populations of ir - luminous and low luminosity galaxies .
however the larger increase of @xmath202 compared to @xmath203 results in a much more rapid evolution of sources characterized by the highest bolometric luminosities .
the contribution of ir luminous galaxies , though negligible in the local universe , becomes comparable to that of normal starbursts around @xmath2@xmath00.7 and they dominate beyond .
we also see that such ir luminous sources are mostly dominated by lirg - type objects up to @xmath2@xmath01 and that ulirgs still have a modest impact ( @xmath010% ) at this redshift .
this is once again in good agreement with the isocam surveys ( e.g. , * ? ? ?
however these ulirgs have undergone the fastest evolution in the last 8gyrs and our results suggest that their contribution is likely still rising at @xmath2@xmath61 . as already revealed by the submillimeter surveys ( see * ? ? ?
* for a review ) , they may therefore be responsible for a very significant fraction of the star - forming activity of the universe at @xmath2@xmath023 ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .
how can this strong evolution observed in the infrared be understood in the general context of the growth of structures  ?
there is now increasing evidence that the most massive galaxies seem to have formed their stars early in cosmic history and that their contribution to the comoving sfr density of the universe was significantly larger at higher redshifts ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?
* ; * ? ? ?
similarly it has been shown that a significant fraction of galaxies with masses @xmath75@xmath610@xmath13@xmath77 at @xmath2@xmath00.7 - 1.0 are experiencing a violent episode of star formation , while nearly all equally - massive sources at the present day are found in a very quiescent mode ( e.g. , * ? ? ?
* ; * ? ? ?
* ; * ? ? ?
* ; * ? ? ?
* ) . in parallel to this downsizing effect characteristic of the stellar mass assembly history ,
the evolution of the luminosity function at infrared and submillimeter wavelengths reveals a transfer of the star formation from the most luminous high redshift sources to more modest local starbursts .
if we consider that lirgs and ulirgs are preferentially associated with more massive systems ( see fig.10d ) , this result might be closely related to the mass growth picture described above .
however the connection between the two is likely more subtle as we found that the fraction of ir luminous sources with @xmath75@xmath410@xmath13@xmath77 is not negligible either .
the relation between ir luminosities and masses has indeed a large dispersion and the dominant contribution of lirgs / ulirgs to the star formation at @xmath2@xmath01 does not necessarily imply that the sfr at these redshifts is only locked in massive systems .
a similar conclusion has been proposed by @xcite , who showed that the star formation density at @xmath2@xmath01 was dominated by systems with @xmath75@xmath410@xmath204@xmath77 .
much larger samples of sources will be required to address this issue in more detail , especially by de - projecting the comoving sfr density into the ir - luminosity / mass / redshift 3-dimensional space .
this goal could be achieved in the very near future by combining all the mips cosmological surveys that are currently being carried out with _ spitzer . _
we have analyzed a sample of mips/_spitzer _
24@xmath1 m sources detected in the chandra deep field south using ancillary optical data from the literature ( i.e. , magnitudes , spectroscopic and photometric redshifts ) .
our results can be summarized as follows :    * for 24@xmath1 m sources brighter than @xmath080@xmath1jy , the selection criterion @xmath3@xmath424mag provides a complete sample of optical counterpart identifications up to @xmath2@xmath00.8 . * about 55 - 60% of the 24@xmath1 m objects
brighter than @xmath080@xmath1jy are located at @xmath2@xmath41 , which points to a significant fraction of the mips 24@xmath1 m sources being luminous and ultra - luminous infrared galaxies at even higher redshifts . *
the 24@xmath1 m source population at 0.5@xmath4@xmath2@xmath41.0 is dominated by lirg - type objects and slightly fainter sources ( i.e. , l@xmath67@xmath410@xmath7l@xmath65 ) .
ulirgs are found to be rare at these redshifts . *
the conversion between fluxes and luminosities depends strongly on the assumed infrared seds .
this points to a crucial need for more accurate determinations of ir templates , a goal which could be achieved with mips and irs . * as in the local universe , infrared luminous sources up to @xmath2@xmath01 are also luminous at optical wavelengths and they tend to be more massive than the bulk of optically - selected distant galaxies . * the comoving energy density measured in the infrared evolves as ( 1+@xmath2)@xmath20 at 0@xmath4@xmath2@xmath41 . in contrast , the luminosity density in the uv only evolves as ( 1+@xmath2)@xmath24 over the similar redshift range .
this points to a more important extinction by dust reprocessing light in the ir at high redshift . *
the infrared - selected sources at 0@xmath4@xmath2@xmath41 have undergone strong evolution characterized by @xmath192@xmath16(1+@xmath2)@xmath17 and @xmath175@xmath16(1+@xmath2)@xmath19 . at @xmath2@xmath01 , infrared luminous galaxies ( i.e. , l@xmath67@xmath610@xmath7l@xmath22 ) appear to be responsible for 70@xmath2315% of the comoving ir energy density .
they dominate the star - forming activity beyond @xmath2@xmath00.7 .

in this work we imposed a selection criterion @xmath3@xmath924mag when considering the 24@xmath1 m sources identified with a photometric redshift from the combo-17 survey . as we showed in sect.3
, this selection obviously results in an incompleteness of the mips - selected population at @xmath2@xmath60.8 - 1.0 .
we provide in this appendix a few more details characterizing the possible nature of the sources that we may have missed in the estimate of the lfs at high redshift .    in figure15
we show the relation between the @xmath205 color and the @xmath3-band magnitude of the mips sources identified with an optical counterpart from combo-17 ( top panel ) .
the 24@xmath1 m vega magnitudes were calculated assuming a zero point of 7.3jy as defined in the _ spitzer observing manual . _ as pointed out in sect.6 , the apparently well - defined correlation that is observed is a natural consequence of the small range of 24@xmath1 m fluxes ( typically a factor of @xmath010 over our sample ) compared to the much larger range ( @xmath05 magnitudes ) covered by the optical counterparts of the mips sources ( see also fig.8a ) .
if we only consider 24@xmath1 m objects brighter than the 80% completeness of our survey ( i.e. , @xmath83@xmath2183@xmath1jy ) , we see that the selection at @xmath3=24mag defines a complete sample up to @xmath205@xmath011.6 .
we miss therefore the reddest sources of the mips catalog ( shaded region of fig.1 ) .      to get a hint into the possible nature of these targets , we also plot in figure15 the total infrared luminosities ( as derived in sect.5 ) versus the @xmath205 colors for the mips sources identified with a spectroscopic or a photometric redshift ( bottom panel ) .
different symbols are used to highlight sources as a function of the @xmath3-band magnitude . as we see , 24@xmath1 m objects redder than @xmath206@xmath011.6 are not obviously the most extreme in terms of dust emission and their luminosity can vary between @xmath05@xmath1210@xmath13l@xmath22 and a few  10@xmath11l@xmath22 in the infrared . even though sources fainter than @xmath3@xmath024mag may follow a different trend , this dispersion of l@xmath65 with both the color and the @xmath3-band magnitude suggests that these sources span a wide range of ir luminosities . taking into account the evolution of the sensivity limit with redshift in our 24@xmath1 m survey ( see fig.7 ) , they should thus be located in a wide range of redshifts at @xmath2@xmath61 ." ," we analyze a sample of @xmath02600 mips/_spitzer _ 24@xmath1 m sources brighter than @xmath080@xmath1jy and located in the chandra deep field south to characterize the evolution of the comoving infrared ( ir ) energy density of the universe up to @xmath2@xmath01 . using published ancillary optical data we first obtain a nearly complete redshift determination for the 24@xmath1 m objects associated with @xmath3@xmath424mag counterparts at @xmath2@xmath41 . 
 these sources represent @xmath055 - 60% of the total mips 
 24@xmath1 m population with @xmath5@xmath680@xmath1jy , the rest of the sample likely lying at higher redshifts . 
 we then determine an estimate of their total ir luminosities using various libraries of ir spectral energy distributions . 
 we find that the 24@xmath1 m population at 0.5@xmath4@xmath2@xmath41 is dominated by `` luminous infrared galaxies '' ( i.e. , 10@xmath7l@xmath8@xmath9l@xmath10@xmath910@xmath11l@xmath8 ) , the counterparts of which appear to be also luminous at optical wavelengths and tend to be more massive than the majority of optically - selected galaxies . a significant number of fainter sources ( 5@xmath1210@xmath13l@xmath8@xmath4l@xmath10@xmath910@xmath7l@xmath8 ) are also detected at similar distances . 
 we finally derive 15@xmath1 m and total ir luminosity functions ( lfs ) up to @xmath2@xmath01 . in agreement with the previous results from @xmath14 and scuba and 
 as expected from the mips source number counts , we find very strong evolution of the contribution of the ir - selected population with lookback time . 
 pure evolution in density is firmly excluded by the data , but we find considerable degeneracy between strict evolution in luminosity and a combination of increases in both density and luminosity ( @xmath15@xmath16(1+@xmath2)@xmath17 , @xmath18@xmath16(1+@xmath2)@xmath19 ) . 
 a significant steepening of the faint end slope of the ir luminosity function is also unlikely , as it would overproduce the faint 24@xmath1 m source number counts . 
 our results imply that the comoving ir energy density of the universe evolves as ( 1+@xmath2)@xmath20 up to @xmath2@xmath01 and that galaxies luminous in the infrared ( i.e. , l@xmath10@xmath2110@xmath7l@xmath22 ) are responsible for 70@xmath2315% of this energy density at @xmath2@xmath01 . taking into account the contribution of the uv luminosity evolving as ( 1+@xmath2)@xmath24 , we infer that these ir - luminous sources dominate the star - forming activity beyond @xmath2@xmath00.7 . 
 the uncertainties affecting these conclusions are largely dominated by the errors in the @xmath25-corrections used to convert 24@xmath1 m fluxes into luminosities . "
"non - axisymmetric deformations of rapidly rotating bodies are rather generic phenomena in nature and can appear in a wide class of systems .
particularly interesting within an astrophysical context are those deformations taking place in fluids that are self - gravitating and the literature on this has a long history dating back to the work of  @xcite on incompressible newtonian uniformly rotating bodies . since then , the study of these instabilities has continued over the years both in newtonian gravity and in full general relativity .
special attention has traditionally been paid to the study of @xmath3 instabilities , which are characterized by the exponential growth of @xmath3 deformations , where @xmath4 parametrizes the azimuthal dependence @xmath5 in a standard mode decomposition in spherical harmonics .
most of the interest in this type of deformation in compact stars stems from the fact that it has the shortest growth time and leads to the emission of a strong gravitational - wave signal .
the development of non - axisymmetric instabilities is commonly analyzed in terms of the quantity @xmath6 ( _ i.e. _  the ratio between the kinetic rotational energy @xmath7 and the gravitational potential energy @xmath8 ) , that provides a dimensionless measure of the amount of angular momentum that can be tapped to feed the development of the instabilities .
this parameter plays an important role in what is possibly the most celebrated of the non - axisymmetric instabilities : the so - called _ dynamical _ bar - mode instability .
this is an @xmath3 instability which takes place when the parameter @xmath1 is larger than a critical one , @xmath9 . in the case of a newtonian incompressible self - gravitating polytrope , for instance
, the dynamical bar - mode instability develops for @xmath10  @xcite and is only weakly dependent on the considered polytropic index or whether the fluid is compressible .
post - newtonian ( pn ) studies  @xcite or fully general - relativistic ones  @xcite correct this results only slightly , by reducing the threshold to somewhat lower values of the instability parameter . as an example , for a polytropic relativistic star with polytropic index @xmath11 , the accurate calculations reported in  @xcite reveal that the critical value is @xmath12 and that a simple dependence on the stellar compactness allows one to track this threshold from the newtonian limit over to the fully relativistic one  @xcite .
the onset and development of the bar - mode instability has been traditionally studied by means of nonlinear 3d simulations of newtonian stars that are either unmagnetized  @xcite and , more recently , also magnetized  @xcite . in addition ,
pn and fully relativistic simulations have been performed and highlighted , for instance , that the persistence of the bar is strongly dependent on the degree of overcriticality and is generically of the order of the dynamical timescale .
furthermore , generic nonlinear mode - coupling effects between the @xmath13 and the @xmath3 mode appear during the development of the instability and these can severely limit the persistence of the bar deformation and eventually suppress the bar deformation  @xcite .
these results have been recently confirmed by the perturbative calculations in  @xcite .    besides dynamical instabilities , which are purely hydrodynamical , _ secular _ instabilities are also possible in rotating compact stars and these are instead triggered by dissipative processes , such as viscosity or radiation emission . if , in particular , the dissipative mechanism is the emission of gravitational radiation , then the secular instability is also known as chandrasekhar - friedman - schutz or cfs instability  @xcite .
contrary to what their name may suggest , secular instabilities do not necessarily develop on secular timescales ( although they normally do ) and are characterized by having a much smaller threshold for the instability . once again , in the case of a newtonian polytrope , the critical secular instability parameter is as small as @xmath14 and thus much more easy to attain in astrophysical circumstances .
although widely observed in numerical simulations , the physical conditions leading to a dynamical bar - mode instability are difficult to be encountered in standard astrophysical scenarios .
such large values of the instability parameter , in fact , can not be easily attained in old and cold neutron stars , which have been brought into uniform rotation and thus to rather small values of @xmath1 .
however , more recently these pessimistic prospects have been changed when a new @xmath3 instability has been discovered in differentially rotating newtonian stars  @xcite for values of @xmath15 , therefore well below the expected values for a dynamical bar - mode instability .
the most salient aspect of this new instability is that it appears in stars with a large degree of differential rotation and that it grows on a timescale which is longer but comparable with the dynamical one .
this instability has been referred to as the `` low-@xmath2 instability '' and its dependence on the polytropic index and on the degree of differential rotation has been studied in  @xcite . since then , the instability has been observed or discussed in a number of related studies  @xcite , all of which have highlighted the possible occurrence of this type of instability during the collapse of a massive stellar core .    despite the abundant numerical evidence on the development of this instability ,
the nature of these low-@xmath2 instabilities is still matter of debate and , most importantly , a sufficient criterion for its onset has not been derived yet .
this instability has been studied in great detail by watts and collaborators  @xcite , who have made a number of phenomenological predictions either using a toy shell - model first introduced in  @xcite , or for a stellar model in newtonian gravity .
overall , the work of watts and collaborators ( but see also  @xcite ) recognizes the low-@xmath2 instabilities as the manifestation of a more generic class of instabilities , the _ shear instabilities _
@xcite , that is unstable oscillations that do not exist in uniformly rotating systems and are associated to the existence of a corotation band  @xcite .
watts , andersson and jones suggest , in particular , that a necessary condition for the development of the instability is `` corotation '' , that is the presence of a point at which the star rotates at the same pattern speed of the unstable mode  @xcite .
an alternative suggestion on the necessary conditions has been made also by ou and tohline  @xcite , who instead associate the development of the instability to the presence of a minimum in the vortensity profile of the star .
this minimum can then drive unstable not only the corotating @xmath3-modes but also the odd modes such as the @xmath13 and @xmath16-modes  @xcite . in this interpretation
, the growth time of the instability is proportional to distance between the corotation radius , _
i.e. _  the radial position at which the unstable mode corotates with the star , and the minimum of the vortensity .
the purpose of this work is to shed some light on the development of shear instabilities and , in particular , to validate one prediction made , although not explicitly , by watts , andersson and jones .
more specifically , we show that , for sufficient amounts of differential rotation , shear instabilities develop for _ any value _ of the instability parameter @xmath1 and also below the expected critical value for the dynamical bar - mode instability .
we therefore provide evidence that the low-@xmath2 instability is not a new instability but rather the manifestation of a shear instability in a region where the latter is possible only for small values of @xmath1 .
our analysis proceeds via the simulation in full general relativity of sequences of neutron star models having constant rest - mass and constant degrees of differential rotation , but with different amounts of rotation , _
i.e. _  with different values of @xmath1 .
the neutron - star matter is described by a realistic equation of state ( eos ) defined by the unified sly prescription  @xcite and we study the development of the non - axisymmetric instabilities from their linear growth up to the fully nonlinear development and suppression .
interestingly , we find that depending on the degree of differential rotation , the shear instability leads either to the growth of a single modes ( for the low-@xmath1 models ) or to the simultaneous presence of up to three unstable modes ( for the high-@xmath1 models ) , which produce beatings in the growth of the overall @xmath3 deformation .
special attention is also paid to the properties of the unstable modes and to their position within the corotation band or the vortensity profiles . in this way we are able to confirm both
the necessary conditions proposed so far for the onset of the instability . in particular , we show that all the unstable modes are within the corotation band of the progenitor axisymmetric model  ( _ cf .
_  @xcite ) and that all of the unstable models have vortensity profiles with a local minimum ( _ cf .
_  @xcite ) .
the structure of the paper is as follows : in section [ sec : numerics ] we describe the numerical setting of our simulations , the eos we used and the initial models we generated . in section [ sec : methodology ]
we describe the quantities and tools we used to monitor the evolution of the instability . in section
[ sec : results ] we report the results of the simulations and section [ sec : conclusions ] is dedicated to conclusions and discussion .
we use a spacelike signature @xmath17 and a system of units in which @xmath18 ( or in cgs units whenever more convenient ) .
greek indices are taken to run from @xmath19 to @xmath20 , latin indices from @xmath21 to @xmath20 and we adopt the standard convention for the summation over repeated indices .
in what follows we provide a brief overview of the numerical setup used in the simulations , of the realistic eos adopted and on the procedure followed for the construction of the initial axisymmetric models .
we solve numerically the full set of einstein equations @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the einstein tensor and the stress - energy tensor , respectively .
the equations are solved within the `` 3 + 1 '' decomposition of spacetime , in which the @xmath25-dimensional metric @xmath26 is decomposed into the spatial metric @xmath27 , the lapse function @xmath28 and the shift vector components @xmath29 .
the field equations , which then also provide an evolution for the extrinsic curvature tensor @xmath30 , are then coupled to those of general relativistic hydrodynamics @xmath31 where , in the case of a perfect - fluid , the stress - energy tensor is given by @xmath32 above @xmath33 is the fluid @xmath25-velocity , @xmath34 is the fluid pressure , @xmath35 the specific internal energy and @xmath36 the rest - mass density , so that @xmath37 is the energy density in the rest frame of the fluid .
the set of hydrodynamics equation is then closed by a prescription for the properties of the matter in the form of a relation between the pressure and other quantities in the fluid , _
e.g. _  @xmath38 , and for which we have chosen a cold and realistic eos which will be discussed in the following section .
the evolution of the spacetime was performed using the ` ccatie ` code , a three - dimensional finite - differencing code providing a solution of a conformal traceless formulation of the einstein equations ( see  @xcite for the explicit expressions of the equations solved in the code and also  @xcite for a more recent and improved implementation ) .
the relativistic hydrodynamics equations , on the other hand , were solved using the ` whisky ` code , which adopts a flux - conservative formulation of the equations as presented in  @xcite and high - resolution shock - capturing schemes or hrsc ( see  @xcite for the explicit expressions of the equations solved in the code and also  @xcite for a more recent extension of the code to mhd ) .
the ` whisky ` code implements several reconstruction methods , such as total - variation - diminishing ( tvd ) methods , essentially - non - oscillatory ( eno ) methods  @xcite and the piecewise parabolic method ( ppm )  @xcite .
also , a variety of approximate riemann solvers can be used , starting from the harten - lax - van leer - einfeldt ( hlle ) solver  @xcite , over to the roe solver  @xcite and the marquina flux formula  @xcite ( see  @xcite for a more detailed discussion ) .
all the results reported hereafter have been computed using the marquina flux formula and a ppm reconstruction .
both the einstein and the hydrodynamics equations are solved using the vertex - centered adaptive mesh - refinement ( amr ) approach provided by the ` carpet ` driver  @xcite .
our rather basic form of amr consists of box - in - box structures centered on the origin of the coordinate system and with the finest grid covering the whole star at all times .
the simulations reported here make use of @xmath25 levels of refinement , with the finest having a resolution of @xmath39 and the coarsest one a resolution of @xmath40 .
the outer boundary was set relatively close to the star and at a distance of @xmath41 , _
i.e. _  at about @xmath42 times the size of the star . a reflection symmetry across the @xmath43 ( equatorial symmetry ) plane was used to reduce the computational costs , but not a rotational one around the @xmath44-axis ( @xmath45-symmetry ) as it would have artificially prevented the growth of odd-@xmath4 modes ( see discussion in  @xcite ) .
as mentioned above , the system of hydrodynamics equations needs to be closed by an eos relating the pressure with the other primitive variables , _
e.g. _  the rest - mass density .
previous studies of the bar - mode instability , both in newtonian gravity and in general relativity , have been focused on the use of ideal fluids and analytic eoss , either in the form a of a `` polytropic '' ( and isentropic ) eos @xmath46 , or of an `` ideal - fluid '' and ( non - isentropic ) eos @xmath47 ( _ cf .
_  discussion in  @xcite ) .
while these two descriptions are expected to provide results that are qualitatively correct , a more accurate modelling of these instabilities in compact stars necessarily requires a more physically - motivated description of the neutron - star matter .
it is in this spirit that we have here considered a realistic eos , namely the unified sly eos  @xcite , which models high - density and cold ( _ i.e. _  zero temperature ) matter via a skyrme effective potential for the nucleon - nucleon interactions .
the sly eos , which describes via a single effective hamiltonian the neutron star s interior , is supplemented with the hp94 eos  @xcite to describe the crustal matter and with the bps eos  @xcite for lower density regions .
this prescription results in a one - parameter eos in the form @xmath48 , where the sly eos is used for @xmath49 , the hp94 eos is used for @xmath50 and the bps eos for @xmath51 ( see also figure  1 of  @xcite ) .
in addition , at even lower densities the eos becomes temperature dependent ( and thus no longer a simple barotropic eos ) , but because these these regions are well below the threshold for the artificial atmosphere , we do not consider an additional prescription for @xmath52 .
we recall , in fact , that our hrsc methods require the use of a tenuous atmosphere which fills the regions of the computational domain not occupied by the compact star .
the threshold value for the rest - mass density of the atmosphere is chosen to be several orders of magnitude smaller than the maximum value and in our simulation a fluid element is considered to be part of the atmosphere if its rest - mass density @xmath36 satisfies @xmath53 .
when this happens the fluid element is treated as a non - dynamical cold fluid described by a polytropic eos , @xmath54 , with @xmath11 and @xmath55 and its velocity is set to zero ( see  @xcite for a more detailed discussion on the use of the atmosphere in the ` whisky ` code ) .
the practical implementation of the realistic eos can take place in a number of different ways .
the simplest is to use standard interpolation techniques , _
e.g. _  based on lagrangian polynomials , on the values of the published tables .
while straightforward , the interpolations in this approach do not guarantee in general that the thermodynamics relations are fulfilled ( see  @xcite for a thermodynamical preserving interpolation ) .
in addition , the derivatives of the fields , _ e.g. _  of the pressure to evaluate the sound speed , are typically not available in the tables . furthermore , the use of high - order interpolation and/or finite differences can lead to undesirable spurious oscillations .    a second approach that removes
all of these problems , uses analytic fits that have been proposed for the pressure . as an example , ref .
@xcite suggested to fit the specific internal energy of the unified sly eos table with the expression @xmath56 where @xmath57 , @xmath36 and @xmath35 are in cgs units , and the coefficients @xmath58 are @xmath59 ( see table  @xmath60 of  @xcite ) .
equation  ( [ eq : analfit ] ) is obtained from eq .
( 15 ) of  @xcite after using @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the baryon number density and @xmath63 is the mass of the nucleons . as discussed in  @xcite , it is then possible to compute the pressure from the value of @xmath35 using the first principle of thermodynamics at @xmath64 @xmath65 and thus to have an evaluation of the pressure which is thermodynamically consistent .
the differences between the fit and the table are typically less then @xmath66 .
unfortunately , although apparently very convenient , the evaluation of the fitting formulas containing several exponential and logarithmic functions , turns out to be computationally rather expensive even if done in a optimized way .    as a third approach , which combines the efficiency of a table search with the thermodynamical consistency of an analytic fit ,
consists of performing a simple linear interpolation among the tabulated values constructed from the analytic fit . besides being highly efficient
, a linear interpolation also eliminates the spurious oscillations that arise , for instance , in the derivative of the pressure if high - order interpolation formulas are used . in this case , the interpolation error can be reduced simply by populating the analytically constructed tables with a large number of entries , _ e.g. _
@xmath67 in place of the @xmath68 which are typically available in published tables .
this third approach is the one actually implemented in ` whisky ` and provides a speed up of about @xmath69 with respect to the evaluation of the pressure via the analytic fits and with comparable accuracy .
the initial data for our simulations are prepared as stationary and axisymmetric equilibrium solutions for rapidly rotating relativistic stars  @xcite . adopting spherical quasi - isotropic coordinates ,
the line element of the corresponding spacetime is @xmath70 where @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 are functions of @xmath75 and @xmath76 .
moreover we assume the usual relativistic @xmath77-constant law of differential rotation and that amounts to assume an angular - velocity distribution of the form @xmath78 \ , ,    \label{eq : velocityprofile_gr}\ ] ] where @xmath79 is the coordinate equatorial stellar radius and the coefficient @xmath80 provides a measure of the degree of differential rotation .
expression  ( [ eq : velocityprofile_gr ] ) represents the general - relativistic equivalent of the simpler newtonian @xmath77-constant law  @xcite
@xmath81 clearly , @xmath82 corresponds to a star in uniform rotation , while @xmath83 corresponds to a star with increasing degree of differential rotation . as a reference
, @xmath84 yields a star with an angular - velocity profile which varies of a factor @xmath85 between the center and the surface of the star ( _ cf .
_  left panel of figure  [ fig : ida ] ) .    in practice ,
we have computed a very large number of initial models using the sly prescription for the eos for which we have computed _ baryonic _ mass @xmath86 , the gravitational mass @xmath87 , the angular momentum @xmath88 , the rotational kinetic energy @xmath7 and the gravitational binding energy @xmath8 defined as @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the square root of the determinant of three - dimensional metric @xmath27 and @xmath91 is the fluid lorentz factor .
we stress that the definitions  ( [ eq : def m])([eq : def w ] ) of quantities such as @xmath88 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath1 are meaningful only in the case of stationary axisymmetric configurations and should therefore be treated with care once the rotational symmetry is lost .

starting from the left : the name of the model , the differential rotation parameter @xmath80the instability parameter @xmath1 , the compactness @xmath95 , the central rest - mass density @xmath96 , the maximum of the density @xmath97 ( note that for models with @xmath93 , @xmath98 . ) , the ratio between the polar and the equatorial coordinate radii @xmath99 , the proper equatorial radius @xmath100 , the gravitational mass @xmath87 , the total angular momentum @xmath88 divided by the square of the gravitational mass . [ cols='^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ ' , ]     out of this large set , we have then selected for the numerical evolution a number of models so as to build sequences of constant baryonic mass with @xmath101 , degree of differential rotation @xmath102 and values of the instability parameter @xmath1 ranging between @xmath103 and @xmath104 . each model in this sequence is supramassive , namely it has a mass which is larger than the maximum mass allowed for a corresponding nonrotating model , _
@xmath105 , although it is not hypermassive , namely it does not have mass which is above the maximum mass for a uniformly rotating model , _
i.e. _  @xmath106 .
there are two different reasons why such a large - mass model has been chosen .
the first one is that we are interested in the development of a shear instability in the metastable star produced by the merger of a binary system of two neutron stars .
as shown by a number of authors and most recently in  @xcite , the product of this merger is either a supramassive or a hypermassive neutron star .
hence , our reference model has a mass which is sufficiently large so as to be a reasonable approximation to the product of a binary neutron star merger .
the second reason is that a sufficiently massive model is necessary in order to reach values of the instability parameter which are above the expected threshold for dynamical bar - mode instabilities as computed in  @xcite , _ i.e. _  @xmath107 .
indeed , the maximum possible value for @xmath1 within the computed sequence is around @xmath108 and thus just above the threshold ( _ cf . _  long - dashed line in the left panel of figure [ fig : idb ] ) .
note also that the threshold for the instability tends to increase for smaller rest - masses .
overall , when comparing with equilibrium models generated with a polytropic eos with @xmath55 and @xmath11 ( see table  1 of  @xcite ) the realistic eos models reach higher compactness ( models in  @xcite typically have @xmath109 ) but lower values of @xmath1 ( _ i.e. _  @xmath110 for the models considered here , while @xmath111 for the polytropic models considered in  @xcite ) .
the whole space of parameters is shown in figure  [ fig : idb ] , whose left panel reports the position in the @xmath112 plane of the initial models computed with @xmath92 , and where the filled circles represent those we have evolved numerically . indicated with solid thin lines are isocontours of constant baryon mass models while indicated with a thick dashed line is the threshold to the dynamical bar - mode instability as computed for a @xmath11 polytrope  @xcite .
the right panel reports the same initial models considered in the left one but shown in @xmath113 planes with isocontours of constant @xmath1 ( upper part ) or constant @xmath95 ( lower part ) .
the main properties of the simulated models are also reported in table  [ table : initial ] , where we also introduce our naming convention .
any initial model is indicated as ` m.% .
# ` , with ` % ` being replaced by the value of the differential - rotation parameter @xmath114 and ` # ` by the instability parameter @xmath1 . as an example ,  ` m.1.200 ` is the star with @xmath92 and @xmath115 .    finally , shown in figure  [
fig : ida ] are the angular - velocity profiles ( left panel ) and the rest - mass density profiles ( right panel ) of some representative models , namely  ` m.1.150 ` , ` m.1.200 ` and  ` m.1.250 ` . indicated with different symbols , which match the ones in the left panel of figure  [ fig : corotation_band ] ,
are the normalized radial positions of the corotation radii , with the one for model  ` m.1.150 ` being shown filled to help distinguish it from the others .
although we postpone to sections  [ sec : evolution ] and  [ sec : necessary conditions ] the discussion of the implications of these corotation radii , two aspects of the initial data are worth emphasizing .
the first one is that the amount of differential rotation for a given value of @xmath114 effectively decreases when increasing the instability parameter @xmath1 ( _ cf .
_  left panel of figure  [ fig : ida ] ) , thus resulting in a smaller corotation band for models with large @xmath1 .
the second one is that all the initial models evolved are axisymmetric but have a `` toroidal - topology '' , namely have the maximum density @xmath97 that is not at the center of the star , and thus @xmath116 .
this toroidal deformation increases with the rotation and thus with @xmath1 .     and
@xmath92 ( a similar behaviour is shown also by the models with @xmath93 ) .
indicated with different symbols , which match the ones in the left panel of figure  [ fig : corotation_band ] and  [ fig : corot_rad ] , are the normalized radial positions of the corotation radii , with the one for model  ` m.1.150 ` being shown filled to help distinguish it .

a number of different quantities are calculated during the evolution to monitor the dynamics of the instability . among them
is the quadrupole moment of the matter distribution @xmath117 which we compute in terms of the conserved density @xmath118 rather than of the rest - mass density @xmath36 or of the @xmath119 component of the stress energy momentum tensor .
of course , the use of @xmath120 in place of @xmath36 or of @xmath119 is arbitrary and all the three expressions would have the same newtonian limit , though with different amplitudes for the gravitational waveforms produced ( see for example @xcite ) .
however , we here adopt the form ( [ eq : defquadrupole ] ) because @xmath121 is a quantity whose conservation is guaranteed by the form chosen for the hydrodynamics equations .    the quadrupole moment ( [ eq : defquadrupole ] )
can be conveniently used to quantify both the growth time of the @xmath3 instability @xmath122 and the oscillation frequency once the instability is fully developed @xmath123 .
( hereafter we will indicate respectively with @xmath124 and @xmath125 the growth time and frequencies of the @xmath126 unstable modes and we note that , as will be discussed later on , during the simulation a number of different modes appear , thus justifying the use of the upper index `` @xmath127 '' ) . in practice
, we perform a nonlinear least - square fit of the @xmath128 component of the computed quadrupole @xmath129 and we generally use as fitting function a sum of @xmath130 ( usually three ) exponentially modulated cosines @xmath131 where @xmath132 . because we commonly have only about @xmath133 cycles in the time interval considered for the fits , extreme care needs to be applied when computing the growth time , especially when the oscillation frequencies and the growth times are close to each other . in these cases , in fact , variations of the initial phase of the modes @xmath134 can result in large variation of the growth times . in view of this , we will not report them .    using three components of the quadrupole moment in the @xmath135 plane
we can define the distortion parameters @xmath136 and @xmath137 , as well as the axisymmetric mode @xmath138 as @xmath139 so that the modulus @xmath140 and the instantaneous orientation of the bar are given by @xmath141    finally , as a useful tool to describe the nonlinear properties of the development and saturation of the instability , the rest - mass density is decomposed into its fourier modes @xmath142 as @xmath143 the phase @xmath144 essentially provides the instantaneous orientation of the @xmath4-th mode when the corresponding mode has a nonzero power . note that despite their denomination , the fourier modes ( [ eq : modes ] ) do not represent proper eigenmodes of oscillation of the star . while , in fact , the latter are well defined only within a perturbative regime ,
the former simply represent a tool to quantify , within the fully nonlinear regime , what are the main components of the rest - mass distribution . as a final comment
we note that while all quantities ( [ eq : defquadrupole])([eq : phimodes ] ) are expressed in terms of the coordinate time @xmath145 and are not invariant measurements , the lengthscale of variation of the lapse function at any given time is always larger than twice the stellar radius at that time , ensuring that events on the same timeslice are also close in proper time .
in what follows we first describe the dynamics of the shear instability as deduced from the numerical simulations and then contrast our results with the phenomenological predictions on the necessary conditions for its development .      . for each panel

is the corotation band for all models.,title='fig:',scaledwidth=42.5% ]    -0.5 cm    as mentioned when discussing the initial data , we have evolved numerically two sequences of constant baryonic mass , with @xmath149 .
the first sequence has a higher degree of differential rotation ( _ i.e. _  @xmath92 ) and instability parameter ranging from @xmath150 to @xmath151 .
the second sequence , on the other hand , has a smaller degree of differential rotation ( _ i.e. _  @xmath152 ) and instability parameter between @xmath153 and @xmath115 . for both sequences
the highest value of @xmath1 considered is also very close to the highest attainable with our initial data code ( see figure [ fig : idb ] ) . to keep the computational costs to an affordable level we have evolved of all these models for @xmath154 and although this time window is in general insufficient to capture the suppression of the instability , is adequate to measure the frequencies of the unstable modes and provide a first estimate of the growth times .    after analyzing the results following the method outlined in the previous section and focusing on the properties of the distortion parameters @xmath146 , @xmath155 and @xmath148
, we find that _ all of the models _ show an @xmath3 instability .
the maximum distortions obtained during the simulation time are @xmath156 ( _ i.e. _  distortions of @xmath157 with respect to the axisymmetric progenitor ) , with the maximum values being reached for the models of the @xmath92 sequence .
the models of the @xmath93 sequence , in fact , have in general much smaller distortions , with @xmath158 over the timescale over which they have been evolved .
we believe this is simply the consequence of the fact that the models in this sequence have smaller growth rates ( see also the discussion in the next section ) .    to show the general behaviour of the simulation we focus on the description of the result of the simulation for the @xmath92 sequence as this is representative also of the one with @xmath93 .
in particular , in the upper part of each panel in figure [ fig : evolutiongeneral ] we show the time evolution of the distortion parameter @xmath159 computed with eq .
( [ eq : etas ] ) for six representative models :  ` m.1.150 ` ,  ` m.1.160 ` , ` m.1.200 ` ,  ` m.1.220 ` ,  ` m.1.241 ` and ` m.1.250 ` .
similarly , in the lower parts of each panel we show the corresponding evolution of the fourier - modes computed from eq .
( [ eq : modes ] ) for @xmath160
.    note that for models with lower values of @xmath1 the bar - mode deformation is very similar to the one already discussed in  @xcite , growing exponentially and with only one unstable mode appearing ( _ cf .
_  first row of figure [ fig : evolutiongeneral ] ) .
however , as the rotation is increased , the development of the instability is more complex and at least two unstable modes appear which develop in different parts of the star .
these two modes have very similar but distinct frequencies and growth times , leading to a series of beatings in the evolutions of @xmath159 , whose irregular evolution makes the calculation of the growth times challenging ( _ cf . _
second row ) .
as the rotation is increased towards the maximal values of @xmath1 , up to three distinct modes appear and the evolution of the instability is correspondingly more complex ( _ cf . _  third row ) .
a similar behaviour is shown also by the evolution of the fourier modes .
the two models with lower @xmath1 , in fact , show a clear growth of the @xmath3 mode and of the @xmath13 , with the latter becoming first comparable and then larger when the instability is suppressed . in models  ` m.1.250 , m.1.241 ` , on the other hand , the @xmath3 and @xmath16 modes have comparable amplitude for a long period and then the @xmath3 becomes the dominant one ( this is more clear in model  ` m.1.241 ` ) .
finally , for larger values of @xmath1 , the @xmath13 mode never attains values comparable with either the @xmath3 or the @xmath16 , which instead control the evolution .
figure  [ fig : psd ] reports the power spectral density ( psd ) of @xmath146 and @xmath148 for the same @xmath161 models ( solid black lines ) and allows to appreciate how the spectrum changes as the instability parameter is increased .
more specifically , it is very apparent that at low @xmath1 the spectra have only one peak , whose maximum is marked by the vertical blue dotted lines and that is present at all the values of beta considered ; this is the mode we refer to as @xmath162 ( _ cf . _  table  [ table : results ] and figure  [ fig : corotation_band ] ) . as @xmath1 increases , the amplitude of this peak decreases and it becomes the weakest for very large rotation rates .
starting from model  ` m.1.200 ` ( although a hint of a peak is present already in  ` m.1.160 ` ) , a second peak appears at higher frequency and is marked with magenta vertical dot - dashed lines ; this is the mode we refer to as @xmath163 and although it never becomes the largest one , its amplitude increases with @xmath1 .
finally , a third peak appears at low frequency in the spectra starting from model  ` m.1.220 ` ( even though a hint is present also for model  ` m.1.210 ` ) and is marked with black vertical long - dashed lines .
this mode , which we refer to as @xmath164 , becomes the dominant one at high @xmath1 .
note also that in each panel of figure  [ fig : psd ] we report with a dashed blue box the corotation band that will be further discussed in the following section .    as a final remark we note that the peaks in the spectrum of @xmath165 ( red dashed lines in figure  [ fig : psd ] ) are related to axisymmetric @xmath166 modes and most likely to @xmath167-modes oscillation excited by the development of the instability .
indeed , their frequencies @xmath168 match reasonably well the phenomenological fit for the @xmath167-mode frequencies of nonrotating neutron stars with realistic eoss computed in  @xcite .
because our sequences do not contain nonrotating configurations ( the rest mass is larger than the maximum one ) , this association is just qualitative and a more detailed investigation of the frequency spectra of the equilibrium models is necessary to confirm this suggestion .

we recall that watts and collaborators pointed out that an unstable configuration should have the unstable mode with a frequency within the corotation band . in the case of the newtonian expression  ( [ eq : velocityprofile_newt ] ) , the corotation band is simpler to compute and for a mode with frequency @xmath303 and azimuthal number @xmath4 , this is simply given by @xmath304 we have therefore checked whether any of the unstable @xmath3 ( bar - modes ) with computed frequency @xmath305 has pattern speed velocity , @xmath306 , within the corotation band .
a careful and rather involved analysis has indeed confirmed the prediction of watts and collaborators : namely , _ all the unstable modes are within the corotation band _ of the progenitor axisymmetric model .
these results for the models with @xmath92 are listed in table  [ table : results ] , where we report the edges of the general - relativistic corotation band in terms of angular frequency at the surface @xmath307 and on the axis @xmath177 , as well as the frequencies of the unstable @xmath3 modes obtained from the position of the peaks in the psd ( _ i.e. _  @xmath308 ) or from the nonlinear fitting of eq .
( [ eq : quadrupolefit ] ) ( _ i.e. _  @xmath309 ) . note that depending on the rate of rotation and the degree of differential rotation some frequencies may not be present in the corotation band .    the data in table  [ table : results ] is also shown in the left panel of figure  [ fig : corotation_band ] , where we plot the position of the non - axisymmetric frequencies @xmath123 within the corotation band as a function of @xmath1 ; indicated with a filled symbol , to distinguish it from the others , is the @xmath310 frequency for model ` m.1.150 ` ( _ cf .
_  figure  [ fig : ida ] and  [ fig : corot_rad ] ) .
the right panel of the same figure shows the corresponding information and on the same scale but for the models with @xmath93 ( the inset shows instead a magnified view ) . clearly , for both sequences all the unstable modes are within the band and , as the stellar rotation rate increases
, more unstable modes appear for the same value of @xmath1 .     for models with @xmath92 and shown as a function of @xmath1 ; indicated with thick solid lines are the edges of the corotation band , _
i.e. _  the frequency interval between @xmath177 and @xmath176 . shown with a filled symbol , to help distinguish it from the others , is the @xmath164 frequency for model  ` m.1.150 ` ( _ cf .

clearly , in both panels all the unstable modes are within the band and up to three unstable modes appear for the @xmath92 sequence with increasing @xmath1.,title='fig:',scaledwidth=49.5% ]    -.5 cm    watts , andersson and jones also give a qualitative description , summarized in their figure 2 of  @xcite , of how the unstable and stable models should be distributed in the ( @xmath311 ) plane .
the considerations they make are particularly simple : for high degrees of differential rotation , that is at low values of @xmath80 , the corotation band is rather wide and there will be both an upper value and a lower value of @xmath1 between which the shear instability can develop ( these critical values of @xmath1 correspond to the entrance and exit of the unstable mode in the corotation band ) .
this situation corresponds therefore to the one commonly encountered in numerical simulations , such as those in  @xcite , and for which the shear instability takes place only for very small values of the instability parameter and on timescales that are much longer than the dynamical one .
when moving to larger degrees of differential rotation , that is when going to smaller values of @xmath80 , the corotation band becomes larger and larger and the shear instability can develop essentially for all values of @xmath1 , merging with the dynamical bar - mode instability for @xmath312 .
this is exactly what has been found here .
conversely , when moving to smaller degrees of differential rotation , that is when going to higher values of @xmath80 , the corotation band becomes thinner and the shear instability can develop only for a smaller range of @xmath1 . as the differential rotation is further decreased and the star tends to rotate uniformly , the corotation band width vanishes , all the models are stable to the shear instability and subject only to the dynamical bar - mode instability for @xmath313 .
this is indeed the case for the unstable models evolved in  @xcite , which were purely ( bar - mode ) dynamically unstable and none of which had the unstable mode within the corresponding corotation band , but above it .
in essence , therefore , there should be an intermediate range of @xmath80 for which the instability is absent at low @xmath1 , appears at intermediate values and then disappears again at high @xmath1 , thus defining an interval of values of @xmath1 for which the models are unstable . to validate also this prediction we simulated a sequence of models with smaller differential rotation and @xmath152
this seconds sequence has the same baryonic mass as that with @xmath314 , but with @xmath1 in a smaller range , namely between @xmath153 and @xmath115 ( note that @xmath115 is also very close to the largest value for which we could build an equilibrium model . ) unfortunately , also all of these models show an @xmath3 shear instability , with the unstable frequencies falling within the corotation band , as it was for the @xmath314 stars .
of course , lack of evidence is not evidence of absence and the fact that we have not found stable models within our range of values of @xmath1 most likely means that these stable models have to be searched either for values of @xmath315 ( for this value of @xmath152 ) , or by moving towards higher values of @xmath80 , where the corotation band is less large .
an obvious consequence of the phenomenological scenario described by  @xcite and confirmed by the calculations reported here is that the idea of a low-@xmath2 instability is indeed misleading and it is instead more meaningful to think of a more generic shear instability that , depending on the degree of rotation and of differential rotation , may manifest itself on timescales that are comparable with the dynamical ones ( as in the cases reported here ) or on much longer ones ( as in the cases reported in  @xcite ) .
another phenomenological prediction made by watts , andersson and jones in  @xcite , is that the growth times should be shorter in the center of the band and increase towards the edges ( the growth times should in fact diverge at the edges ) .
as shown in figure  [ fig : corotation_band ] , all of the simulated models do have unstable modes well inside the corotation band and this probably explains why we observe them develop on a timescale which is comparable with the dynamical one and not on much longer timescales as in the original finding of  @xcite .
we also find indications that the @xmath152 models , which generically have longer growth times , have unstable modes which occupy regions of the corotation band that are overall more central ( _ cf .
_  right panel of figure  [ fig : corotation_band ] ) and thus in contrast with what expected from  @xcite .
however , the difficulties mentioned above in computing an accurate estimate of the growth times and the intrinsic difficulties in determining what is the central part of the corotation band , prevent us from providing a more quantitative validation of this prediction .
we now switch to consider our results in the light of the other necessary condition for the onset of the shear instability discussed in  @xcite .
as mentioned in the introduction , it has in fact been shown that the presence of a minimum in the profile of the vortensity is a necessary condition for a mode in corotation to be unstable  @xcite .
the intuitive description is that the vortensity well can act as a resonant cavity inside the star , amplifying the modes that happen to lay near its minimum  @xcite . indeed
, the growth rate of the unstable mode is expected to depend on the location of its corotation radius with respect to the vortensity profile , being proportional to the depth of its corotation radius inside the vortensity well  @xcite .
note that the mere existence of a local minimum in the vortensity can not be used as a sufficient condition for the occurrence of a shear instability .
all of the unstable models considered in  @xcite , in fact , do show a local minimum in the vortensity but do not have the unstable modes in the corotation band .
for three representative models with small , medium and high values of @xmath1 .
the different symbols match the ones in figure  [ fig : ida ] and in the left panel of figure  [ fig : corotation_band ] , with the one for model  ` m.1.150 ` reported as filled , and show the actual position of the corotation radii . note
that none of these coincides with the minimum of @xmath316 ; for compactness we have reported only the models with @xmath92 .

the different symbols match the ones in figure  [ fig : ida ] and in the left panel of figure  [ fig : corotation_band ] , with the one for model  ` m.1.150 ` reported as filled , and show the actual position of the corotation radii . note

right panel : normalized corotation radii for the different frequencies @xmath123 presented in the left panel of figure  [ fig : corotation_band ] shown as a function of @xmath1 ; the same convention of the previous figures is used for the different symbols.,title='fig:',scaledwidth=49.5% ]    -.5 cm    to validate whether this newtonian condition holds also for the general - relativistic instabilities simulated here , we have computed for all the models the newtonian vortensity , which is defined as the ratio , along the radial cylindrical coordinate , between the radial vorticity and the density @xmath317 where @xmath318 is the radial cylindrical coordinate ( a fully general - relativistic definition of the vortensity is also possible but more complicated to compute and not significantly different from the newtonian one ) .
when doing this we found that all the unstable models have vortensities with a local minimum in the star and this is shown in the left panel of figure [ fig : corot_rad ] , which reports the radial profiles of the vortensity @xmath316 for three representative models with small , medium and high values of @xmath1 .
the different symbols match the ones in the left panel of figure  [ fig : ida ] and  [ fig : corotation_band ] , with the one for model  ` m.1.150 ` reported as filled , and show the actual positions of the corotation radii .
the right panel of the same figure , on the other hand , shows the normalized corotation radii for the different frequencies @xmath123 presented in the left panel of figure  [ fig : corotation_band ] as a function of @xmath1 .    note
that none of these coincides systematically with the minimum of @xmath316 , nor with the maximum of the rest - mass density .
all of the corotation radii , however , do move towards larger radial positions as the rotation rate is increased , exactly as does the minimum of the vortensity and the rest - mass maximum . although we can not confirm that modes whose corotation radius is closer to the minimum of the vortensity have systematically shorter growth times ( our data is not sufficiently accurate for this ) , we can compare the models with the higher degree of differential rotation @xmath92 with those having a smaller degree of differential rotation @xmath93 .
in the first case the vortensity well is considerably deeper , with @xmath319 , while for the latter the vortensity has shallower wells with @xmath320 .
since the models with @xmath321 have smaller growth rates , our results indicate therefore that also the existence of a local minimum in the vortensity can be taken as a necessary condition for the development of the shear instability and that the depth of the vortensity well can be used to estimate the growth of the instability .
for many years the properties of rapidly rotating and self - gravitating fluids have been characterized by a complete analytic perturbative theory which provided , for instance , sufficient conditions for the development of instabilities ( see , for instance ,  @xcite for a collection of results ) . as numerical simulations have become increasingly accurate and stable on longer timescales , these predictions , both in newtonian theory and in full general relativity ,
have been verified , corrected and in some cases extended .
our ability of modelling such configurations has now reached a maturity such that a number of new properties and instabilities have been `` discovered '' numerically , but which do not have behind a fully perturbative description .
the main reason for this is that most of this phenomenology is the result of physical scenarios which are much more complex than the ones investigated perturbatively in the past , _
e.g. _  non - isolated systems with high differential rotation and exchanging mass and angular momentum , which are much more difficult to treat analytically .
a most notable example of these complex and yet ubiquitous instabilities is the so - called `` low-@xmath2 instability '' , which was initially found in  @xcite and then reproduced in a number of other different scenarios  @xcite .
as the phenomenological description of this instability provided by the simulations has become richer and richer , a full understanding of the mechanisms that lead to its development has lagged behind and it is presently unclear .
we are therefore in a situation in which numerical simulations can probe regimes and conditions which are not yet accessible to perturbative calculations , and can guide the latter by confirming or refuting those scenarios that although possible do not find a realization in practice .
this work has followed this spirit and has used fully general - relativistic calculations of rapidly and differentially rotating neutron stars modeled with a realistic eos to shed some light on the development of the low-@xmath2 instability . in particular we have concentrated our attention on validating an indirect prediction , made by watts , andersson and jones  @xcite , who recognized the low-@xmath2 instability as the manifestation of a more generic class of instabilities associated to the existence of a corotation band  @xcite , the _ shear instabilities _ , and that should develop for _ any value _ of the instability parameter @xmath1 when sufficient amounts of differential rotation are present .
this is exactly what we have found in our simulations .
more specifically , we have performed simulations of sequences of neutron - star models described by a realistic sly eos  @xcite and having constant rest - mass and degrees of differential rotation , but with different amounts of rotation . in all cases
considered we have found the development of a bar - mode instability growing on a dynamical timescale , even when the initial axisymmetric models were well below the critical limit for the dynamical bar - mode instability .
these results , which match well the phenomenological scenario portrayed in  @xcite , suggest therefore that the idea of a low-@xmath2 instability is indeed misleading and should be replaced by the more general one of shear instability . depending then on the degree of rotation and of differential rotation
, the instability will develop on timescales that are comparable to the dynamical one ( as reported here ) or on much longer ones ( as reported in the first low-@xmath2 instability studies ) .
special attention has also been paid to the properties of the unstable modes and to their position within the corotation band or the vortensity profiles . in particular , we have shown that all the unstable modes are within the corotation band of the progenitor axisymmetric model ( which is the necessary condition for the development of the instability proposed by  @xcite ) and that all of the unstable models have vortensity profiles with a local minimum ( which is the necessary condition suggested by  @xcite ) .
finally , by comparing the growth times among models with different degree of differential rotation we have shown that there is a correlation , although not a strong one , between the depth of the vortensity well and growth rate of the instability , with the latter being larger for models with deeper wells .    in summary ,
the results presented here shed some light on several aspects of shear instabilities , but they also reveal that more work is required , for instance , to distinguish between the predictions based on the corotation band and the ones based on the vortensity well , or to establish whether in effect they just represent two different ways of expressing the same physical conditions .
clarifying these aspects will requires additional analytical and numerical modelling , and this will be part of our future research .

 we model the stars in full general relativity and describe the stellar matter adopting a cold realistic equation of state based on the unified sly prescription  @xcite .

 this class of instability , which has so far been found only for small values of @xmath1 and with very small growth rates , is therefore more generic than previously found and potentially more effective in producing strong sources of gravitational waves .

"fission of the nucleus is important to many processes . for instance fission should play an important role in superheavy synthesis , as well as many astrophysical phenomena . as for the researches based on the tddft
, there are several developments in the fission research recently ( for example , see @xcite ) .
let us imagine the collision between nuclei .
we use a terminology collision - fission to denote the fission resulting from collision .
fusion - fission and quasi - fission are the main components of the collision - fission .
there are several stages in nuclear collisions depending on the time - scales @xcite . at the early stage
there is a contact between the two nuclei , and the quite rapid processes ( @xmath0 10@xmath1s ) such as the fast charge equilibration follows @xcite . at the intermediate stage ( @xmath010@xmath2s )
composite nucleus is formed , and the collective oscillation such as giant resonance follows . sometimes after a sufficient time ( @xmath3s ) , fission appears .
[ t ]    , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 in the left panel ) .
the two nuclei in the entrance channel might have relative velocity ( shown as the arrows ) , but the velocities in the entrance channel are free parameters in this formalism .
there is a constraint on the composite nucleus in which the distance between the two center of mass is given ( center panel ) .
the relative velocity of the two nuclei is set to exactly equal to zero for the composite nucleus , and they might have a certain overlap .
this constrained composite nucleus is the initial state of the tddft calculations .
the details of the exit channel such as the kind of emitted nuclei and the relative velocity between the nuclei are determined by the tddft calculations .
the conditions for the calculations are shown in red character.,width=453 ]    we present a formalism called `` composite - nucleus constrained tddft '' to investigate the collision - fission dynamics . in this article we mostly focus on the examination of charge equilibrium hypothesis of the collision - fission dynamics .
collision - fission dynamics of a composite nucleus thorium 240 is systematically investigated based on time - dependent density functional calculations employing sv - bas interaction parameter set  @xcite .
a hypothesis , in which fission fragments produced from collision - fission have almost the same @xmath7-ratio to the composite nucleus , is assumed in phenomenological treatments of studying the collision - fission events ( for the charge equilibration dynamics in collision - fission events , see @xcite ) .
the reason is that quantum mechanical time - evolution including the nucleon degrees of freedom is desired to determine the time evolution of charge distribution . in this case
@xmath8 for the initial nucleus , and the point is to examine whether the @xmath7-ratio of fission product is close to @xmath9 or not .      for a given energy and a given impact parameter , long - lived composite nuclei with certain excitation energies ( compared to the ground state )
are possible to be produced .
let us take a composite nucleus of mass number @xmath10 and proton number @xmath11 .
consider binary collision - fission ( fig .
1 ) : @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 . first , choose the combination of the two nuclei at the entrance channel ( @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) to determine the heavy - ion reaction being considered ( @xmath17 ) ; six cases are taken as @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 .
those states are obtained by the static density functional calculations .
second , two states are put at a distance @xmath2413.125  fm without giving any velocities to the center of mass ( center panel of fig .  1 ) , where the diameter ( @xmath25 ) of @xmath26 nucleus is roughly equal to 14.9  fm ( cf .
@xmath27 ) .
this corresponds to the constraint on the composite nucleus .
third , the initial many - body wave function of the tddft calculations that is eventually given as an orthogonalized single slater determinant is given .
in fact a single slater determinant consisting of two single wave functions of two different nuclei ( two different slater determinants ) are orthogonalized before starting tddft calculations ( cf .
the gram - schmidt orthogonalization method ) , since the two single wave functions should have overlap .
the initial many - body wave function physically simulates the excited composite nucleus in which the relative velocity of the original colliding nuclei is equal to zero .
forth , the tddft calculation is carried out to see whether the fission appears or not and to see whether the fission fragments are in charge equilibrium or not .
-ratio is plotted for entrance and exit channels ( blue and red bars , respectively ) .
the logarithmic scale is adopted for the horizontal axis .
duration time from the entrance to exit channels is roughly equal to 10@xmath28s .
the charge equilibrium corresponds to @xmath29 in this case .
the maximal and minimal @xmath7 values are also shown for reference.,width=377 ]    in this formalism two physical quantities are constrained : the shortest distance of the two colliding nuclei ( i.e. , distance of the closest approach ) and the kind of colliding nuclei at the entrance channel . the most significant assumption included in this formalism is that no change is assumed to happen to the two colliding nuclei at the very early stage before the two colliding nuclei reach the shortest distance .
this formalism is originally proposed by refs .
certain difficulty in the standard tddft approach is expected to be overcome ; indeed , the constrained composite nuclei sometimes hold the localization effect ( e.g. clustering effect ) , which can be lost in the mean - field type calculations such as the standard tddft .      the smaller one of the final products are @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , which are produced from @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath33 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 , respectively .
one case results in fusion , and the others in binary fission . among five binary - fission cases , the masses of the lighter fragment decrease for three cases , which is pronounced to be a specific feature with the fragmentation arising from lowly - excited composite nuclei @xcite .
figure 2 shows @xmath7-ratios of the fragments for the entrance and exit channels .
this figure corresponds to a    one - dimensional dynamical system projected in terms of a physical quantity @xmath7 in which the charge equilibrium ( @xmath41 ) plays a role of attractor . indeed the @xmath7-range of the distribution becomes smaller from @xmath42 to @xmath43 .
consequently it is confirmed in this specific setting that the charge equilibrium hypothesis is satisfied rather well .
charge equilibration hypothesis has been examined by means of a microscopic tddft framework , and this hypothesis has been confirmed to be satisfied well .
alrhough , as for the tddft calculations , the charge equilibration dynamics was examined with nonzero initial relative - velocities , it is carried out with zero initial relative - velocities ( i.e. , zero tddft - initial velocities ) . despite researchers believed the possibility of the non - negligible effects of relative velocity on the charge equilibration in old times , the present results suggest that such an effect is quite small .

the _ permanental polynomial _ of @xmath0 , @xmath16 , is defined as the permanent of the characteristic matrix of @xmath12 , i.e. , @xmath17    it seems that the permanental polynomial was first considered by turner @xcite .
he in fact considered a graph polynomial called generalized characteristic polynomial which generalizes both the permanental and characteristic polynomials .
the permanental polynomials of graphs were first systematically studied by merris et al .
@xcite , and the study of analogous objects in chemical literature was started by kasum et al .
@xcite . in these two papers ,
an important sachs - form formula was obtained independently which relates the coefficients of the permanental polynomial of a graph with structural properties of the given graph .
the literature on permanental polynomial is far less than that on characteristic polynomial ( see , for example , @xcite ) .
this may be due to the difficulty of computing the permanent .
recall that two graphs @xmath0 and @xmath18 are said to be _ cospectral _ if they have the same spectrum , and a graph @xmath0 is _ determined _ by its spectrum ( or equivalently , characteristic polynomial ) if any graph cospectral with @xmath0 is isomorphic to @xmath0 .
analogously , merris et al .
@xcite defined two graphs @xmath0 and @xmath18 to be _ copermanental _ if they have the same permanental polynomial . a graph @xmath18 , copermanental but non - isomorphic to a graph @xmath0 ,
is called a _ copermanental mate _ of @xmath0 .
we say that a graph @xmath0 is _ determined _ ( or _ characterized _ ) by its permanental polynomial if it has no copermanental mates .    for any graph polynomial
, it is of interest to determine its ability to characterize graphs  @xcite . in @xcite , merris et al .
formulated that the permanental polynomial seems a little better than the characteristic polynomial when it comes to distinguishing graphs which are not trees , since they found that the permanental polynomial distinguishes the five pairs of cospectal graphs of @xcite .
it is natural to ask whether the permanental polynomial really performs better than the characteristic polynomial when we use them to distinguish graphs .    motivated by merris et al.s formulation , liu and zhang  @xcite studied the copermanental characterizations of some specific graphs .
they showed that complete graphs , stars , regular complete bipartite graphs and odd cycles are determined by their permanental polynomials , and found that graphs determined by the characteristic polynomial are not necessarily determined by the permanental polynomial .
in particular , it was shown that in general , the paths , even cycles and lollipop graphs can not be determined by the permanental polynomial  @xcite , while they are determined by their characteristic polynomials  @xcite .
recently , cmara and haemers  @xcite proved that there is just one pair of cospectral graphs when at most five edges are deleted from @xmath19 ( the complete graph on @xmath11 vertices ) , whereas zhang et al .
@xcite showed that all graphs obtained from @xmath19 by removing at most five edges are determined by the permanental polynomial .
the spectral characterizations of graphs have been extensively studied , and it was conjectured that almost all graphs are determined by their characteristic polynomials  @xcite .
some computational results on the spectra of graphs have been obtained .
godsil and mckay  @xcite enumerated by computer all graphs on at most 9 vertices , computed their spectra and determined the numbers of graphs for which there exists at least one cospectral mate .
haemers and spence  @xcite extended the computer enumeration to graphs on 10 and 11 vertices .
brouwer and spence  @xcite found the characteristic polynomials for all graphs on 12 vertices , and statistics related to the number of cospectral graphs are obtained .
the present data give some indication that possibly almost no graph has a cospectral mate .
the main purpose of this paper is to give the preliminary results of a computational study of copermanentality of graphs .
we enumerate by computer the permanental polynomials of all graphs on at most 11 vertices , and determine the number of graphs for which there exists at least one copermanental mate .
the numerical data give some indication that the fraction of graphs with a copermanental mate tends to zero as the number of vertices tends to infinity , and show that the permanental polynomial does be better than characteristic polynomial when we use them to characterize graphs .
to determine the copermanentality of graphs we first of all have to generate the graphs by computer and then determine their permanental polynomials .
all graphs on at most 11 vertices are generated by the well - known nauty and traces package  @xcite .
then the permanental polynomials of these graphs are computed by a maple procedure .
finally we count the number of copermanental graphs .
the results are in table  [ tab : table 1 ] .
this table lists for @xmath20 the total number of graphs on @xmath11 vertices , the total number of distinct permanental polynomials of such graphs , the number of such graphs with a copermanental mate , the fraction of such graphs with a copermanental mate , and the size of the largest family of copermanental graphs .
.data of permanental polynomials of graphs on @xmath20 vertices [ cols='>,>,>,>,>,>',options='header ' , ]     in table  [ tab : table 1 ] we see that the fraction of graphs with a copermanental mate appears to be decreasing with the number of vertices . in particular , the fraction decreases sharply at @xmath21 , and about 0.099@xmath22 of all graphs on 10 vertices are not determined by their permanental polynomials .
the data give some indication that possibly the fraction of graphs with a copermanental mate tends to zero as @xmath11 tends to infinity .
an interesting observation from tables  [ tab : table 1 ] and [ tab : table 2 ] is that the fractions of graphs with a copermanental mate are much less than that with a cospectral mate . in addition , the fractions of graphs with a copermanental mate decrease rapidly with the number of vertices , while the fractions of graphs with a cospectral mate increase at first and start to decrease at @xmath21 .
clearly , the data show that the permanental polynomial performs better than the charactersitic polynomial when we use them to characterize graphs . however , it is worth pointing out that the study of copermanental characterizations of graphs is more difficult than the cospectral characterizations of graphs ( see , for example , @xcite ) .
since two graphs with distinct number of edges must have distinct permanental polynomials  @xcite , the enumeration has been carried out for each possible number of edges .
the data , differentiated according to the number @xmath23 of edges , is presented in tables  [ tab : table_3][tab : table_10 ] .
we end with the smallest pairs of cospectral and copermanental graphs .
the smallest pair of cospectral graphs is illustrated in fig .
[ fig : fig_1](a ) , and the smallest three pairs of copermanental graphs are illustrated in fig .
[ fig : fig_1](b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) .        [ fig : fig_1 ]
we list the numbers of graphs for all numbers @xmath23 of edges up to 11 vertices , the numbers of distinct permanental polynomials of such graphs , the numbers of such graphs with a copermanental mate , and the maximum size of a family of copermanental graphs ( see tables  [ tab : table_3][tab : table_10 ] ) .

"competition and cooperation are two inseparable sides of the same coin .
while competition is a key concept in darwin s theory of evolution , cooperation is rather puzzling , yet ubiquitous in nature  @xcite .
how cooperative behavior evolved among self - interested individuals is an important open question in biology and social sciences , along with the issue of how cooperation contends with competition in order to achieve global and individual optima .
a powerful tool to analyze these problems is evolutionary game theory  @xcite , an application of the mathematical theory of games to biological contexts . of particular relevance
are two - player games where each player has a strategy space containing two possible actions ( 2@xmath02 games ) , to cooperate ( c ) or to defect ( d ) .
the payoff of a player depends on its action and on the one of its co - player .
assuming pairwise , symmetric interaction between the players , there are four possible values for this payoff .
cooperation involves a cost to the provider and a benefit to the recipient .
two cooperators thus get a _ reward _ @xmath1 while two defectors get a _ punishment _
the trade between a cooperator and a defector gives the _ temptation _
@xmath3 for the latter , while the former receives the _ sucker s
payoff _ , @xmath4 .
we renormalize all values such that @xmath5 and @xmath6 .
the ranking of the above quantities defines the game they are playing .
the paradigmatic example is the _ prisoner s dilemma _ ( pd ) game in which the four payoffs are ranked as @xmath7 .
it clearly pays more to defect whatever the opponent s strategy : the gain will be @xmath8 if the other cooperates and @xmath9 if he defects .
the dilemma appears since if both play d they get @xmath2 , what is worse than the reward @xmath1 they would have obtained had they both played c. the pd is related with two other _ social dilemma _
games  @xcite . in most animal contests ( in particular those involving escalating conflicts ) , mutual defection is the worst possible outcome for both players , and the damage exceeds the cost of being exploited , _
i.e. _   @xmath10 .
this game is called _ chicken _
@xcite or _ snowdrift _ ( sd ) . on the other hand , when the reward surpasses the temptation to defect , _
@xmath11 , the game becomes the _ stag hunt _
( sh )  @xcite .
the coordination of slime molds is an example of animal behavior that has been described as a stag hunt  @xcite .
when individual amoebae of _ dictyostelium discoideum _ are starving , they aggregate to form one large body whose reproductive success depends on the cooperation of many individuals . here , we consider for @xmath12 the pd ( @xmath13 ) and the sd ( @xmath14 ) , whose interface ( @xmath15 ) is known as the weak form of the pd game , with @xmath16 .
the stag hunt ( sh ) game is obtained for @xmath13 and @xmath17 .
classical evolutionary game theory constitutes a mean - field - like approximation which does not include the effect of spatial , correlated structures of populations .
axelrod  @xcite suggested to place the agents on a two - dimensional spatial array interacting with their neighbors .
this cellular automaton was explored by nowak and may  @xcite , who found that such spatial structure allows cooperators to build clusters in which the benefits of mutual cooperation can outweigh losses against defectors , thus enabling cooperation to be sustained , in contrast with the spatially unstructured game , where defection is always favored .
the original nowak - may model was extended and modified in several different ways ( see ref .
@xcite and references therein ) . related to the present work
, the effects of dilution and mobility were recently studied in refs .
@xcite in the weak form of the pd game .
mobility effects are difficult to anticipate .
when non - assortative movements are included , the effective number of neighbors increases ( towards the random mixing limit ) .
moreover , those clusters so necessary to sustain cooperation may now evaporate .
both these effects promote defection and the number of cooperators is expected to decrease . on the other hand , dilution  @xcite and mobility decrease the competition for local resources and help to avoid retaliation and abuse ( although that may require more contingent movements ) , thus tending to increase cooperation . in the evolutionary game context , diffusion was studied by several authors , sometimes as a cost to wander between patches without spatial structure  @xcite or as a trait connected with laying offspring within a given dispersal range  @xcite .
an explicit diffusive process was studied in the framework of the replicator equation  @xcite , extended to include a diffusive term  @xcite ; however , the interactions were still mean field like .
aktipis  @xcite considered contingent movement of cooperators with a `` win - stay , lose - move '' rule , allowing them to invade a population of defectors and resist further invasions .
models with alternating viscosities , which reflect different stages of development that can benefit from the clusterization of cooperators or from dispersal , have also been considered and promote altruism , since the high viscosity phase allows interactions between close relatives and the low viscosity phase reduces the disadvantages of local competition among related individuals . in cases of populations with only a highly viscous phase ,
the effects of interactions among relatives and competition for local resources tend to balance and thus the evolution of altruistic behavior is inhibited  @xcite .
differently from previous works , ref .
@xcite considered a diluted version of nowak - may s spatial pd model where individuals are able to perform random walks on the lattice when there is enough free space ( the non - assortative `` always - move '' strategy ) . specifically , the setting was the simplest possible : random diffusion of simple , memoryless , unconditional , non - retaliating , strategy - pure agents . under these conditions ,
cooperation was found not only to be possible and robust but , for a broad range of the parameters ( density , viscosity , etc ) , often enhanced when compared to the strongly viscous ( no mobility ) case .
the parameters chosen put the model at the interface between the pd and the sd , and a natural question is how robust is the behavior when @xmath18 , that is , in a genuine pd game ?
moreover , how does mobility affect other games , like the sd or the sh ? recently , jian - yue _ et al _
@xcite extended the results of ref .
@xcite for the sd game and cod dynamics ( see next section ) , but with a restricted choice of @xmath4 and @xmath3 .
another relevant question regards the existence of any fundamental difference between those games when mobility is introduced .
in particular , in those cases where the spatial structure is known to inhibit cooperation  @xcite , does mobility change this picture ?
our objective here is to present a more comprehensive analysis and extend our previous study in several directions , trying to shed some light on the above questions .
the paper is organized as follows .
the following section describes the details of the model and simulation .
then , we present the results for two possible implementations depending on the order of the diffusive and offspring steps . finally , we present our conclusions and discuss some implications of the results .
the model is a two dimensional stochastic cellular automaton in which cells are either occupied by unconditional players ( cooperators or not ) or vacant . at time @xmath19 , the variable @xmath20 is 0 if the corresponding lattice cell is empty , or @xmath21 depending on whether the agent at that site cooperates ( 1 ) or defects ( @xmath22 ) .
the relevant quantity is the normalized fraction of cooperators , @xmath23 , after the stationary state is attained , defined as @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the `` magnetization '' @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the system size and @xmath28 is the fraction of occupied sites , that is kept fixed at all times ( when @xmath29 , we call the system diluted ) .
the symbol @xmath30 stands for an average over the ensemble of initial configurations .
we call `` active '' a site that has changed strategy since the previous step . at each time step , all individuals play against all its four nearest neighbors ( if present ) , collecting the payoff from the combats . after that
, it may either move or try to generate its offspring .
we consider a best - takes - all reproduction : each player compares its total payoff with those of its nearest neighbors and changes strategy following the one ( including itself ) with the greatest payoff among them .
this strategy changing updating rule preserves the total number of individuals , thus keeping @xmath31 constant .
if a tie among some of the neighbors occurs , one of them is randomly chosen . during the diffusive part
, each agent makes an attempt to jump to a nearest neighbor site chosen randomly , that is accepted , provided the site is empty , with a probability given by the mobility parameter @xmath32 . notice that @xmath32 does not measure the effective mobility , that depends on both @xmath32 and @xmath31 , but only a tendency to move , space allowing
. however , different combinations of both parameters could give the same effective mobility ( measured , for example , through the mean square displacement ) , but that parameter alone would not suffice to characterize the game , since spatial correlations are determined by @xmath31 . among the several ways of implementing the reproductive and diffusive steps ,
here we consider two possibilities , named contest - offspring - diffusion ( cod ) and contest - diffusion - offspring ( cdo ) . in the former ,
as the name says , each step consists of combats followed by the generation of offspring done in parallel , and then diffusion , while in the latter , the diffusion and offspring steps are reversed .
of course , the stochasticity introduced by the mobility disappears under some conditions ( e.g. , @xmath33 or @xmath34 ) , and the final outcome may now depend on the initial conditions .
we explore many choices of the payoff parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 while @xmath2 and @xmath1 are kept fixed at 0 and 1 , respectively , and compare the effects of diffusion with those obtained either for the related spatial weak version  @xcite or for the randomly mixed limit .
square lattices of sizes ranging from @xmath35 to @xmath36 with periodic boundary conditions are used .
averages are performed over at least 100 samples and equilibrium is usually attained before 1000 network sweeps are completed , although in some cases not even @xmath37 sweeps are enough to bring the system to an equilibrium fixed point .
the initial configuration has @xmath38 individuals placed randomly on the lattice , equally distributed among cooperators and defectors .

indeed , all curves in this interval collapse . notice also that near @xmath33 , negative responses occur and @xmath23 may decrease as @xmath4 gets larger , the effect being stronger for @xmath34 ( see text ) . at small densities , mobility is detrimental to cooperators : isolated clusters of cooperators , that could survive for @xmath34 , can be predated by mobile defectors once mobility is considered . at intermediate densities ,
mobility can strongly increase the amount of cooperation.,title='fig:',width=294 ]   for mobilities @xmath34 ( top ) and 1 ( bottom ) , @xmath6 , @xmath5 , @xmath39 and several values of @xmath4 in the cod case .

notice that @xmath23 may either increase ( @xmath42 is optimal ) or decrease ( a small , but non zero , @xmath32 is optimal ) , depending on the parameters , and that there is a discontinuity at @xmath34.,width=294 ]    ref .
@xcite considered only the weak limit @xmath43 of the pd game for @xmath39 and @xmath5 , that is , inside the region where , for @xmath33 , both strategies coexist along with active sites .
when @xmath44 , this region may comprise values of @xmath4 both in the pd and in the sd regimes , that is , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively .
[ fig.cod_rhoc2 ] and [ fig.cod_s ] show that the results found in ref .
@xcite with the cod dynamics remain unchanged for this rather broad range of @xmath4 . indeed , the line labeled @xmath40 in fig
.  [ fig.cod_rhoc2 ] exactly superposes with the results for all values of @xmath4 in the aforementioned interval , @xmath15 included .
this can be more clearly seen in fig .
[ fig.cod_s ] , where @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath4 are varied , and a plateau in the interval @xmath45  @xcite is observed ( although the value of @xmath23 in the plateau depends on both @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) .
besides this active phase , the system presents a large number of different phases , with sharp transitions between them . for comparison , the no mobility case  @xcite , @xmath34 ,
is also included , as well as the cooperators density when @xmath33 ( solid black line ) .
the transition points , calculated considering the several possible local neighborhoods  @xcite , are represented by vertical dashed and dotted lines located at the points where @xmath4 equals to @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .
in addition to these transitions , a few more are introduced when the system is diluted ( vertical dotted lines ) , @xmath53 , each phase being characterized by the fraction of cooperators and by the way they organize spatially  @xcite . when mobility is introduced after the offspring generation ( cod dynamics )
, no new transition appears . dilution ( without mobility ) allows cooperation for small values of @xmath4 ( @xmath54 ) , which is absent with @xmath33 . for low densities in particular ,
clusters are small and isolated ; therefore , depending on the initial condition , cooperators succeed in forming pure clusters .
however , as soon as mobility is introduced , this disorder driven phase disappears since small cooperative clusters are easily predated by wandering defectors . in this low density situation ,
cooperation is only sustained when the exploitation is not too strong ( larger values of @xmath4 ) , as can be seen in the case @xmath55 and @xmath42 , where cooperation exists only for @xmath56 . for intermediate densities ,
some phases may coalesce , like the large @xmath4 region for @xmath57 where @xmath58 .
interestingly , mobility has a non trivial effect in the negative response that is already present at @xmath33 or @xmath34 . when the sucker s payoff @xmath4 increases ( less exploitation ) , one expects higher levels of cooperation . but the opposite behavior is sometimes observed , and the number of cooperators may also decrease .
an example occurs when @xmath33 as @xmath4 increases beyond the transition point 0.6 , and @xmath23 attains a new plateau , far below the previous one .
however , with mobility such effect may be enhanced , attenuated or reverted .
[ fig.cod_s ] depicts many examples of such behavior .
moreover , for a fixed @xmath31 , mobility affects different phases in diverse ways .
for example , for @xmath57 , when @xmath32 changes from 0.1 to 0.5 , the cooperative phase at @xmath59 disappears , while the one for @xmath60 suffers no alteration .
when @xmath42 , instead , this region splits into five smaller regions .
therefore , whether large or small mobility is better for cooperators strongly depends on both @xmath32 and @xmath31 .
for example , for @xmath61 , @xmath23 increases with @xmath32 when @xmath4 is large and decreases for smaller values .
the behavior of @xmath23 as a function of the mobility is shown in fig .
[ fig.cod_m ] . in some cases cooperation is an increasing function of the mobility and the optimal value is thus @xmath42 . on the other hand , it may also be detrimental for cooperation , and @xmath23 steadily decreases with @xmath32 . in this latter case
, a non zero but very small mobility gives the optimal value .
the most important result is obtained when we compare the simulations with what one would obtain in a large randomly mixed population .
a simple mean field  @xcite argument leads to three possible solutions : two absorbing states , @xmath62 and 1 , and a mixed case with @xmath63 where we have already considered @xmath5 and @xmath6 .
depending on the values of @xmath4 and @xmath3 , one of these solutions may become the stable one . in the mean - field pd case
, there is no cooperation and @xmath62 is the stable solution . for the sh , the stable solution depends also on the initial density of cooperators @xmath64 and eq .
[ eq.mf ] delimits the basin of attraction of each solution : @xmath62 if @xmath65 and 1 otherwise .
the solution given by eq .
[ eq.mf ] , shown in fig .
[ fig.cod_s ] as a curved line , is only stable in the sd game .
it has been known that a structured spatial distribution of agents often inhibits cooperation  @xcite in the sd game , as opposed to what happens in the pd and sh games .
nevertheless , when both dilution and mobility are introduced , cooperation is not so often inhibited . indeed , in fig .
[ fig.cod_s ] one can see that in many cases the spatially distributed population outperforms the randomly mixed population in terms of cooperative behavior .     for mobilities @xmath34 ( top ) and @xmath42 ( bottom ) , @xmath6 , @xmath5 , @xmath66 and several values of @xmath4 with cod dynamics for the sh game .
notice the strong effect of the inclusion of mobility .
the chosen values correspond to the different plateaux seen in fig .
[ fig.cod_s_sh ] .
the density of cooperators is a monotonically increasing function of the total density for @xmath67 , while it is either non - monotonic or monotonically decreasing for @xmath34.,title='fig:',width=294 ]   for mobilities @xmath34 ( top ) and @xmath42 ( bottom ) , @xmath6 , @xmath5 , @xmath66 and several values of @xmath4 with cod dynamics for the sh game .
notice the strong effect of the inclusion of mobility .
the chosen values correspond to the different plateaux seen in fig .
[ fig.cod_s_sh ] .
the density of cooperators is a monotonically increasing function of the total density for @xmath67 , while it is either non - monotonic or monotonically decreasing for @xmath34.,title='fig:',width=294 ]          besides the pd and sd games , we also studied the effect of mobility in the sh game .
[ fig.sh_rhocm1 ] shows the normalized fraction of cooperators as a function of the total density for several values of @xmath13 and @xmath68 when the mobility is either high ( @xmath42 ) or absent ( @xmath34 ) . without mobility ,
isolated clusters of cooperators are able to survive and even at very low densities cooperation is sustained .
once mobility is included , cooperation at low densities is destroyed as small cooperator clusters are easily predated by mobile defectors . on the other hand , at higher densities cooperation
is strongly enhanced and @xmath58 for all values of @xmath13 .
it is interesting to notice that mobility also changes the dependence on the density : with @xmath42 all curves are monotonically increasing functions of @xmath31 , while for @xmath34 they are always decreasing for low @xmath4 and non - monotonic for larger values .
the general dependence on @xmath4 , for several values of the mobility can be observed in fig .
[ fig.cod_s_sh ] .
no negative response appears and the amount of cooperation increases with @xmath4 , as expected .     versus @xmath4 ( @xmath39 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) for different values of the mobility and @xmath31 in the cdo case .
the solid black line is the case @xmath33 , while the vertical ones locate the transition points for both @xmath33 and @xmath53 ( see fig .  [ fig.cod_s ] and text ) . differently from the cod case ,
mobility introduces new transitions ( indicated by vertical solid lines ) at @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath22 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 and 0.,title='fig:',width=294 ]   versus @xmath4 ( @xmath39 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) for different values of the mobility and @xmath31 in the cdo case .
the solid black line is the case @xmath33 , while the vertical ones locate the transition points for both @xmath33 and @xmath53 ( see fig .
[ fig.cod_s ] and text ) .
differently from the cod case , mobility introduces new transitions ( indicated by vertical solid lines ) at @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath22 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 and 0.,title='fig:',width=294 ]    when the diffusion step is performed before the offspring laying ( cdo dynamics ) , the amount of cooperation is often strongly enhanced , as can be observed in fig .
[ fig.cdo_s ] .
cooperators close to defectors have low payoff ; therefore , if they do not move , in the next step their strategy will be replaced by d. on the other hand , if they do move away , there is a probability of surviving depending on the new neighborhood they encounter ( at low densities , for example , they may be isolated after the move , and thus survive ) .
moreover , cooperators that detach from a cooperative neighborhood have high payoff and may replace the defectors they find .
indeed , for many values of the parameters @xmath31 and @xmath32 , cooperators fully dominate the system , even in the region of small @xmath4 values where the cod dynamics allows no cooperators to survive . while all phases appearing in the cod dynamics were already present when @xmath34 , in the cdo case a few new phases appear .
these mobility driven transitions can be seen in fig .
[ fig.cdo_s ] and are marked by solid vertical lines at @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath22 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 and 0 .
in particular , a new transition appears at @xmath15 and , differently from all other cases where the weak pd behavior was representative of a wide range of values of @xmath4 , in this case , although the weak and the strict pd ( @xmath18 ) still behave in the same way , the small-@xmath4 sd becomes different .
even though the density of the two phases is very similar , they are in fact different since the final configurations are slightly different even if we prepare two systems ( for example , one with @xmath73 and the other with @xmath74 ) with identical initial conditions and subject to the same sequence of random numbers .
the main question posed at the beginning was how mobility affects the outcome of different games beyond the weak dilemma at the frontier between the pd and the sd studied in ref .
a main novelty emerges in the context of the sd game : mobility restores the enhancing factor of the spatial structure also found in the pd game , at variance with the @xmath34 case where cooperation is usually lower than the fully mixed case  @xcite . in general , when agents are able to randomly diffuse on the lattice , unmatched levels of cooperation can be attained for wide ranges of the parameters .
moreover , differently from the pd and sh games , the spatial sd presents negative responses when the value of @xmath4 increases : instead of enhancing the amount of cooperation as one would expect , @xmath23 sometimes decreases .
this effect , absent in the fully mixed case , is also observed even in the absence of mobility , something that has not been previously noticed .
cooperators are spatially organized in different ways depending on the game they play .
for example , the clusters may be more compact or filamentous .
this spatial structure rules the effect that mobility has on the fate of the game .
we considered three regions of interest in the @xmath3 and @xmath4 plane , the genuine prisoner s dilemma ( pd ) game ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) , the snowdrift ( sd ) game ( @xmath12 and @xmath14 ) and the stag hunt ( sh ) game ( @xmath17 and @xmath13 ) .
let us analyze what happens for each of the three games separately .
we start with the genuine pd where qualitative differences with respect to the weak dilemma occur only for values of @xmath4 below a threshold @xmath75 , a region in which cooperation is completely extinguished in the presence of mobility .
this is reasonable since by increasing the penalization for the sucker s behavior ( decreasing @xmath4 ) one finally reaches a point below which c agents perform badly and can not overcome the filter of selection . for the cod variant at @xmath39 , @xmath76 no matter the density @xmath31 and for all @xmath77 considered .
on the other hand , for the cdo variant , @xmath75 depends strongly on @xmath31 .
it is remarkable that , even for very severe sucker s penalizations ( down to @xmath78 in the figure , but whatever smaller value will do , and since there is no further transition below @xmath69 , even any negativelly large one ) , for intermediate values of @xmath31 ( e.g. @xmath79 ) , the universal cooperation state ( @xmath58 ) , or a state very close to that , can still be attained .    in less severe dilemmas than the pd
 mutual defection pays less than the sucker s payoff in the sd , and mutual cooperation pays more than cheating in the sh  cooperation is , as one would have expected , in general higher . in the case of the sd , cooperation is often enhanced with respect to the weak dilemma with cod dynamics , while an unprecedented state of universal cooperation ( @xmath58 ) can be sometimes reached with the cdo one .
hauert and doebeli  @xcite noticed that cooperation is often inhibited by spatial structure with @xmath23 being usually lower than its value in a randomly mixed population , where for large systems one of the three solutions @xmath80 , 0 or 1 is stable .
dilution and mobility change dramatically this scenario .
when only dilution ( but no mobility ) is present , cooperation in a spatially distributed system is higher than in the random mixed limit either for intermediate densities or small values of @xmath4 .
when mobility is added , only high densities follow the behavior of the @xmath81 situation where spatial structure inhibits cooperation . on the contrary , for not so high densities cooperation is enhanced in the sd game when @xmath67 . in this way , in the presence of mobile agents , it is again possible to make the statement that spatial structure promotes cooperation . in the cod sh
, the combination of mobility and large density ( @xmath82 ) leads to a boost in @xmath23 or even to universal cooperation .
on the other hand , for smaller values of @xmath31 , provided the sucker s
payoff @xmath4 is also small , @xmath23 is lower .
so a crucial difference is that , for a given mobility , the level of cooperation grows with the density of agents , different from the behavior at @xmath34 .
accessing the actual payoff involved in real situations is not an easy task , and it has been suggested that many examples that have been interpreted as realizations of the pd are also compatible with the sd and the sh games ( see @xcite and references therein ) .
in addition to this , mobility effects on the cooperation of real organisms are still largely unknown , as they are difficult to isolate from other factors and , as the theoretical results presented here have shown , even a tiny amount of mobility is able to produce very strong changes in the final result .
although mobility may have an effect similar to noise , allowing shallow basins to be avoided , they are not equivalent . for example , in ref .
@xcite , several different dynamics , with and without noise , gave consistent results for the inhibition of cooperation in the sd game with spatial structure , while mobility drastically changes this outcome .
since the results seem to strongly depend on the chosen dynamics ( although we have only considered `` best - takes - over '' updatings , it has two possible variants , cdo and cod ) , an important , yet open , question concerns the existence of an unifying principle , in hamilton s sense  @xcite , relating the parameters of the game , that tells us when cooperative behavior might be expected when mobile agents are present .

"in a recent preprint james owen weatherall has attempted a local and deterministic model for the epr - bohm experiment , which he affirms to have been inspired by my work on bell s theorem .
although his analysis mainly concerns his attempted reconstruction of my model and why the attempt fails , his preprint has been worded in a manner that has allowed some readers to embrace his discussion as a criticism of my work on bell s theorem . here
i demonstrate that ( as he himself stresses to some extent ) the analysis weatherall presents in his preprint has nothing to do with my model , or with the physics and mathematics of the epr - bohm correlation .
in fact his analysis exhibits no understanding of how my local - realistic framework works , nor of the reasons why it explains the origins of all quantum correlations .
i show this by first calculating the epr - bohm correlation in a successful local - deterministic model based on the spinor representation of su(2 ) , and then revealing a number of misconceptions and unwarranted assumptions in weatherall s reconstruction of my model as it relates to the bell - chsh inequalities .
i conclude that , contrary to first impressions , weatherall s thinly veiled criticism of my work is entirely vacuous .
in order to bring out the erroneous assumptions in weatherall s analysis , it would be convenient to assess it in the light of a successful model for the epr - bohm correlation .
this will allow us to unveil his assumptions more easily .
to this end , let us recall bell s definition of a _ complete _ theory .
he considered a physical theory to be complete just in case its predictions for the epr - bohm experiment are dictated by local - deterministic functions of the form @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the space of 3-vectors @xmath4 , @xmath5 is a space of the complete states @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is a unit 0-sphere .
he then proved a mathematical theorem concluding that no pair of functions of this form can reproduce the correlation as strong as that predicted by quantum mechanics for the rotationally invariant singlet state : @xmath8 \,\not=\,-\,{\bf a}\cdot{\bf b}\ , .
\label{corre-1 - 1}\ ] ]    as it stands , this conclusion of bell is entirely correct and beyond dispute , provided we accept prescription ( [ map-1 - 1 ] ) as codifying a complete specification of the singlet state . in his preprint , following bell and chsh , weatherall accepts ( [ map-1 - 1 ] ) as codifying a complete specification of the singlet state , whereas my work begins by recognizing that ( [ map-1 - 1 ] ) _ does not _ , and
_ can not _ , codify a complete specification of the singlet state .
i have argued that bell s prescription is based on an incorrect underpinning of both the epr argument and the actual topological configurations involved in the epr - bohm experiments , even if we leave the physics and mathematics underlying the correlation aside .
my argument is rather subtle and requires a clear understanding of what is meant by both a _ function _ in mathematics and the geometry and topology of a parallelized 3-sphere .
but the bottom line of the argument is that , for any two - level system , the epr criterion of completeness demands the correct measurement functions to be necessarily of the form @xmath9 with the _ simply - connected _
codomain @xmath10 of @xmath11 replacing the _ totally disconnected _
codomain @xmath12 assumed by bell .
thus @xmath13 now represents a point of a parallelized 3-sphere , @xmath10 . as a function
, it takes values from the domain @xmath14 and ends up _ belonging _ to the codomain @xmath10 .
consequently , any correlation between a pair of such results is a correlation between points of a parallelized 3-sphere .
unless based on a prescription of this precise form , any bell - type analysis simply does not get off the ground , because without completeness there can be no theorem .    here
@xmath10which can be thought of as the configuration space of all possible rotations of a rotating body ( including spinorial sign changes)is defined as the set of all unit quaternions isomorphic to a unit parallelized 3-sphere : @xmath15}\ ; \bigg|\;||\,{\bf q}(\psi,\,{\bf r})\,||^2=1\right\}\ !
, \label{nonoonpara}\ ] ] where @xmath16 is a bivector rotating about @xmath17 with the rotation angle @xmath18 in the range @xmath19 . throughout this paper
i will follow the concepts , notations , and terminology of geometric algebra .
accordingly , @xmath20 can be parameterized by a unit vector @xmath21 as @xmath22 with @xmath23 . here
the trivector @xmath24 ( which also squares to @xmath25 ) represents a volume form of the physical space .
each configuration of the rotating body can thus be represented by a quaternion of the form @xmath26 which in turn can always be decomposed as a product of two bivectors belonging to an @xmath27 , @xmath28 with @xmath18 being its rotation angle from @xmath29 .
note also that @xmath30 reduces to @xmath31 as @xmath32 for @xmath33 .
it is of paramount importance to note here that our topologically corrected prescription ( [ map-1 - 2 ] ) does not alter the actual measurement results . for a given vector @xmath4 and an initial state @xmath6 ,
both operationally and mathematically we still have @xmath34 as the _ image points _ of the function @xmath11 as demanded by bell , but now the topology of its _ codomain _ has changed from a 0-sphere to a 3-sphere , with the latter embedded in @xmath35 in such a manner that the prescriptions ( [ map-1 - 1 ] ) and ( [ map-1 - 2 ] ) are _ operationally identical _ . on the other hand , without this topological correction it is impossible to provide a complete account of all possible measurement results in the sense specified by epr .
thus the selection of the codomain @xmath36 in prescription ( [ map-1 - 2 ] ) is not a matter of choice but necessity .
what is responsible for the epr correlation is _ the topology of the set of all possible measurement results_. but once the codomain of @xmath11 is so corrected , the proof of bell s theorem ( as given in refs.@xmath37 ) simply falls apart .
moreover , it turns out that the strength of the correlation for _ any_@xmath37 physical system is entirely determined by the torsion within the codomain of the local functions @xmath11 .    returning to weatherall s analysis
, it should be clear now that , because it is based on a prescription other than ( [ map-1 - 2 ] ) , it too is a _ non - starter _ .
more importantly , once we recognize that the _ only _ way of providing a complete account of all possible measurement results for the singlet state is by means of prescription ( [ map-1 - 2 ] ) , the statistical procedure for analyzing the correlation must be consistently customized for the set @xmath10 of all unit quaternions , _ which weatherall fails to do_.since this procedure can be appreciated more readily by studying the explicit construction of my model from my book and elsewhere , i now proceed to reproduce the model in some detail in the following subsections . doing so will also dispel a persistent but gravely disingenuous charge that my model encounters `` certain technical complications '' .
once the measurement results are represented by functions of the form ( [ map-1 - 2 ] ) , it is easy to reproduce the epr - bohm correlation in a manifestly local , realistic , and deterministic manner .
this is because a parallelized 3-sphere has quite a unique and distinctive topological structure .
it is one of the only two parallelizable spheres with non - vanishing torsion  the other one , with variable torsion , being the 7-sphere .
once parallelized by a constant torsion , the 3-sphere remains closed under multiplication , and forms one of the only four possible normed division algebras .
these are profound concepts underlying the very existence and strength of quantum correlations . by ignoring them and dismissing them as irrelevant , weatherall is ignoring the physics and mathematics of the quantum correlations .
more importantly , because of the unique and distinctive topological characteristics of the 3-sphere , the measurement functions such as @xmath11 for the epr - bohm correlation have to be constructed in a very specific manner for any model to be successful . to this end , let us begin with the following definition of the orientation of a vector space :    an orientation of a finite dimensional vector space @xmath38 is an equivalence class of ordered basis , say @xmath39 , which determines the same orientation of @xmath38 as the basis @xmath40 if @xmath41 holds with @xmath42 , and the opposite orientation of @xmath38 as the basis @xmath40 if @xmath43 holds with @xmath44 .
( here repeated indices are summed over . )
thus each positive dimensional real vector space has precisely two possible orientations , which ( rather suggestively ) can be denoted as @xmath45 or @xmath46 .
more generally an oriented smooth manifold such as @xmath10 consists of that manifold together with a choice of orientation for each of its tangent spaces .
it is important to note that orientation of a manifold is a _ relative _ concept . in particular , the orientation of a tangent space @xmath38 of a manifold defined by the equivalence class of ordered basis such as @xmath39 is meaningful only with respect to that defined by the equivalence class of ordered basis @xmath40 , and vice versa . to be sure ,
we can certainly orient a manifold absolutely by choosing a set of ordered bases for all of its tangent spaces , but the resulting manifold can be said to be left or right oriented only with respect of another such set of ordered basis .
now the natural configuration space for an epr - bohm type experiment is a unit parallelized 3-sphere , which can be embedded in @xmath35 with a choice of orientation , say @xmath45 or @xmath25 .
this choice of orientation can be identified with the initial state of the particle pair in the singlet state with respect to the orientation of the detector basis as follows .
we first characterize the embedding space @xmath35 by the graded basis @xmath47 with @xmath48 representing the two possible orientations of @xmath10 and the basis elements @xmath49 satisfying the algebra @xmath50 with an arbitrary metric @xmath51 on @xmath10 . here
the bivectors @xmath52 will represent the spin angular momenta of the particles , with @xmath53 = 1 , 2 , 3 and the repeated indices summed over .
these momenta can be assumed to be detected by the detector bivectors , say @xmath54 , with the corresponding detector basis @xmath55 satisfying the algebra @xmath56 and related to the spin basis @xmath57as @xmath58 evidently , the determinant of this matrix works out to be @xmath59 .
since @xmath60 and @xmath61 is a @xmath62 identity matrix , this relation can be more succinctly written as @xmath63 or equivalently as @xmath64 and @xmath65 these relations reiterate the fact that orientation of any manifold is a _ relative _ concept .
in particular , orientation of @xmath10 defined by the spin basis @xmath66 is meaningful only with respect to that defined by the detector basis @xmath67 with the orientation @xmath45 , and vice versa .
thus the spin basis are said to define the _ same _ orientation of @xmath10 as the detector basis if @xmath68 , and the spin basis are said to define the _ opposite _ orientation of @xmath10 as the detector basis if @xmath69 . note also that the numbers @xmath70 and @xmath71 are treated here on equal footing .
we are now in a position to define the functions @xmath72 and @xmath73 as results of measurement interactions ( or clifford products ) between detector bivectors @xmath74 and @xmath75 and spin bivectors @xmath76 and @xmath77 as follows : @xmath78 and @xmath79 where the relative orientation @xmath6 is now assumed to be a random variable , with 50/50 chance of being @xmath80 or @xmath81 at the moment of creation of the singlet pair of spinning particles . in what follows
, i will assume that the orientation of @xmath10 defined by the detector basis @xmath82 has been fixed before hand .
thus the spin bivector @xmath52 is a random bivector with its handedness determined _ relative _ to the detector bivector @xmath83 , by the relation @xmath84 where , as a direct consequence of the algebra ( [ wh - o88 ] ) with @xmath85 , the bivectors @xmath76 satisfy the following identity : @xmath86 using these relations the spin detection events ( [ 88-oi ] ) and ( [ 99-oi ] ) follow at once from the algebras defined in ( [ wh - o88 ] ) and ( [ wh - o99 ] ) .
evidently , the measurement results @xmath72 and @xmath73 as defined above , in addition to being manifestly realistic , are strictly local and deterministically determined numbers . in fact
, they are not even contextual .
alice s measurement result @xmath72although it refers to a freely chosen direction @xmath87depends only on the initial state @xmath6 ; and likewise , bob s measurement result @xmath73although it refers to a freely chosen direction @xmath88depends only on the initial state @xmath6 .
let us also not overlook the fact that , as binary numbers , @xmath89 and @xmath90 are still points of a parallelized 3-sphere . to confirm this , recall that a parallelized 3-sphere is a set of unit quaternions of the form @xmath91 and a measurement result such as @xmath92 is a limiting case of such a quaternion constituting the 3-sphere : @xmath93 here @xmath94 is the volume form , limit @xmath95 is equivalent to the limit @xmath32 for @xmath33 , @xmath96 is the rotation angle about the axis @xmath97 and @xmath98 is the angle between @xmath87 and @xmath99 .
it is important to note that the variables @xmath72 and @xmath73 defined in equations ( [ 88-oi ] ) and ( [ 99-oi ] ) are generated with _
different _ bivectorial scales of dispersion ( or different standard deviations ) for each measurement direction @xmath87 and @xmath88 .
consequently , in statistical terms these variables are raw scores , as opposed to standard scores . recall that a standard score , z , indicates how many standard deviations an observation or datum is above or below the mean .
if @xmath100 is a raw ( or unnormalized ) score and @xmath101 is its mean value , then the standard ( or normalized ) score , @xmath102 , is defined by @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the standard deviation of @xmath100 .
a standard score thus represents the distance between a raw score and population mean in the units of standard deviation , and allows us to make comparisons of raw scores that come from very different sources . in other words ,
the mean value of the standard score itself is always zero , with standard deviation unity . in terms of these concepts
the correlation between raw scores @xmath100 and @xmath105 is defined as @xmath106}{\sigma({\rm x})\;\sigma({\rm y } ) } \label{co } \\ & = \,\lim_{\,n\,\gg\,1}\left[\frac{1}{n } \sum_{k\,=\,1}^{n}\,{\rm z}({\rm x}^k)\;{\rm z}({\rm y}^k)\right ] .
\label{stan}\end{aligned}\ ] ] it is vital to appreciate that covariance by itself_i.e .
_ , the numerator of equation ( [ co ] ) by itself  does not provide the correct measure of association between the raw scores , not the least because it depends on different units and scales ( or different scales of dispersion ) that may have been used in the measurements of such scores .
therefore , to arrive at the correct measure of association between the raw scores one must either use equation ( [ co ] ) , with the product of standard deviations in the denominator , or use covariance of the standardized variables , as in equation ( [ stan ] ) .
now , as discussed above , the random variables @xmath72 and @xmath73 are products of two factors  one random and another non - random . within the variable @xmath72
the bivector @xmath76 is a random factor  a function of the orientation @xmath6 , whereas the bivector @xmath74 is a non - random factor , independent of the orientation @xmath107 : @xmath108 thus , as random variables , @xmath72 and @xmath73 are generated with _ different _
standard deviations_i.e .
_ , _ different _ sizes of the typical error . more specifically , @xmath72 is generated with the standard deviation @xmath74 , whereas @xmath73 is generated with the standard deviation @xmath75 .
these two deviations can be calculated as follows . since errors in the linear relations propagate linearly , the standard deviation @xmath109 of @xmath72 is equal to @xmath74 times the standard deviation of @xmath76 [ which i will denote as @xmath110 , whereas the standard deviation @xmath111 of @xmath73 is equal to @xmath75 times the standard deviation of @xmath77 [ which i will denote as @xmath112 : @xmath113 but since the bivector @xmath76 is normalized to unity , and since its mean value @xmath114 vanishes on the account of @xmath6 being a fair coin , its standard deviation is easy to calculate , and it turns out to be equal to unity : @xmath115 where the last equality follows from the normalization of @xmath76 .
similarly , it is easy to see that @xmath116 is also equal to @xmath70
. consequently , the standard deviation of @xmath89 works out to be @xmath74 , and the standard deviation of @xmath90 works out to be @xmath75 . putting these two results together , we arrive at the following standard scores corresponding to the raw scores @xmath117 and @xmath118 : @xmath119 and @xmath120 where i have used identities such as @xmath121 .
needless to say , these standard scores are pure bivectors : @xmath122      as noted towards the end of subsection ii@xmath37a , one of several oversights in weatherall s reading of my model concerns his failure to recognize the necessity of applying the correct statistical procedure for analyzing the correlation between the measurement results defined by ( [ 88-oi ] ) and ( [ 99-oi ] ) .
this is surprising , because i pointed out this oversight to him in a private correspondence more than eighteen months ago . as we noted above
, a parallelized 3-sphere is a set of unit quaternions .
each point of a parallelized 3-sphere is thus represented by a unit quaternion . as a result
, the correct statistical procedure within my model must take into account how errors propagate in a 3-sphere of unit quaternions .
accordingly , let a probability density function @xmath123}$ ] of random quaternions over @xmath10 be defined as : @xmath124 where the square root of @xmath125 , @xmath126 , is defined as @xmath127 it is a matter of indifference whether the distribution of @xmath128 so chosen happens to be normal or not . here
@xmath129 is an arbitrary quaternion within @xmath130 of the form ( [ quat-0 ] ) , which is a sum of a scalar and a bivector ( treated on equal footing ) , with @xmath131 being the double - covering rotation angle about @xmath4-axis . the mean value of @xmath129 is defined as @xmath132 and the standard deviation of @xmath133 is defined as @xmath134\ , : = \,\sqrt{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k\,=\,1}^{n}\,\left\{\,{\bf q}^k(\psi)\,-\,m({\bf q})\right\}\ , \left\{\,{\bf q}^k(2\pi-\psi)\,-\,m({\bf q})\right\}^{\dagger}\;}.\label{standipo}\ ] ]    note that in this definition @xmath135 is coordinated by @xmath18 to rotate from @xmath136 to @xmath137 , whereas the conjugate @xmath138 is coordinated by @xmath18 to rotate from @xmath137 to @xmath136 .
thus , for a given value of @xmath6 , both @xmath135 and @xmath138 represent the same sense of rotation about @xmath4 ( either both represent clockwise rotations or both represent counterclockwise rotations ) .
this is crucial for the calculation of standard deviation , for it is supposed to give the average rotational distance within @xmath10 from its mean , with the average being taken , not over rotational distances within a fixed orientation of @xmath10 , but over the changes in the orientation @xmath6 of @xmath10 itself .
note also that , according to the definition ( [ quat-0 ] ) , @xmath135 and its conjugate @xmath139 satisfy the following relation : @xmath140 consequently , the standard deviation of both @xmath138 and @xmath141 must , with certainty , give the same number : @xmath142\,\equiv\,\sigma[\,-\,{\bf q}(\psi)]\,.\ ] ] it is easy to verify that definition ( [ standipo ] ) for the standard deviation of @xmath135 does indeed satisfy this requirement , at least when @xmath143 .
what is more , from equation ( [ relat ] ) we note that the quantity being averaged in the definition ( [ standipo ] ) is essentially @xmath144 .
this quantity is insensitive to spinorial sign changes such as @xmath145 , but transforms into the quantity @xmath146 under orientation changes such as @xmath147 .
by contrast , the quantity @xmath148 would be insensitive to both spinorial sign changes as well as orientation changes .
thus @xmath149}$ ] , as defined in ( [ standipo ] ) , is designed to remain sensitive to orientation changes for correctly computing its averaging function on @xmath150 in the present context .
now , in order to evaluate @xmath151 and @xmath152 , we can rewrite the quaternion ( [ quat-0 ] ) rotating about @xmath153 as a product @xmath154 of a non - random , non - pure quaternion @xmath155 and a random , unit bivector @xmath76 satisfying @xmath156 note that @xmath157 reduces to the unit bivector @xmath158 for rotation angles @xmath159 , @xmath160 , and @xmath161 .
moreover , using the relations @xmath162 and @xmath163 it can be easily checked that the product in ( [ pro ] ) is indeed equivalent to the quaternion defined in ( [ quat-0 ] ) for @xmath153 .
it is also easy to check that the non - random quaternion @xmath157 satisfies the following relation with its conjugate : @xmath164 consequently we have @xmath165 thus , substituting for @xmath166 and @xmath167 from eqs.@xmath37([pro ] ) and ( [ non - pro ] ) into eq.@xmath37([standipo ] ) , together with @xmath168 we have @xmath169\ , & = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k\,=\,1}^{n}\,\left\{\,{\bf p}(\psi,\,{\bf a})\,{\bf l}({\bf a},\,\lambda^k)\,\right\}\ , \left\{\,{\bf l}^{\dagger}({\bf a},\,\lambda^k)\,{\bf p}(\psi,\,{\bf a})\,\right\}\ , } \notag \\ & = \,\sqrt{\,{\bf p}(\psi,\,{\bf a})\,\left\{\,\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k\,=\,1}^{n}\ , { \bf l}({\bf a},\,\lambda^k)\,{\bf l}^{\dagger}({\bf a},\,\lambda^k)\,\right\}\,{\bf p}(\psi,\,{\bf a})\ , } \notag \\ & = \,\sqrt{\,{\bf p}(\psi,\,{\bf a})\,{\bf p}(\psi,\,{\bf a})\,}\ , \notag \\ & = \,\pm\,{\bf p}(\psi,\,{\bf a})\ , .
\label{immminot}\end{aligned}\ ] ] here i have used the normalization of @xmath76 as in ( [ norml ] ) , and the last equality follows from the definition ( [ 1root1 ] ) .
it can also be deduced from the polar form of the product @xmath170    the result for the standard deviation we have arrived at , namely @xmath171\,=\,\pm\,{\bf p}(\psi,\,{\bf a})\ , , \label{minot}\ ] ] is valid for all possible rotation angles @xmath18 between the detector bivector @xmath74 and the spin bivector @xmath76 . for the special cases when
@xmath159 , @xmath172 , @xmath137 , @xmath173 , and @xmath174 , it reduces to the following set of standard deviations : @xmath175\,&=\,\sigma({\mathscr
a})\,=\,\pm\,{\bf d}({\bf a } ) \notag \\
\sigma[\,{\bf q}(\psi=\pi,\,{\bf a},\,\lambda)]\,&=\,\sigma({\bf l}_{\bf a})\,=\,\pm\,1 \notag \\
\sigma[\,{\bf q}(\psi=2\pi,\,{\bf a},\,\lambda)]\,&=\,\sigma({\mathscr a})\,=\,\pm\,{\bf d}({\bf a } ) \notag \\ \sigma[\,{\bf
q}(\psi=3\pi,\,{\bf a},\,\lambda)]\,&=\,\sigma({\bf l}_{\bf a})\,=\,\pm\,1 \notag \\
\text{and}\;\;\;\sigma[\,{\bf q}(\psi=4\pi,\,{\bf a},\,\lambda)]\,&=\,\sigma({\mathscr a } ) \,=\,\pm\,{\bf d}({\bf a})\ , .
\label{setresto}\end{aligned}\ ] ] to understand the physical significance of these results , let us first consider the special case when @xmath176 . then @xmath177 which can be seen as such from the definition ( [ quat-0 ] ) above .
similarly , for the conjugate of @xmath178 we have @xmath179 moreover , we have @xmath180 , since @xmath181 with @xmath182 being a fair coin . substituting these results into definition (
[ standipo])together with @xmath176we arrive at @xmath183 since @xmath184 .
similarly , we can consider the case when @xmath185 and again arrive at @xmath186 .
next , we consider the three remaining special cases , namely @xmath159 , @xmath137 , or @xmath174 .
these cases correspond to the measurement results , as defined , for example , in equation ( [ 88-oi ] ) . to confirm this , recall from equation ( [ amanda ] ) that a measurement result such as @xmath92 is a limiting case of the quaternion ( [ quat-0 ] ) .
if we now rotate the bivector @xmath187 to @xmath76 as @xmath188 using some @xmath189 , and multiply eq.([amanda ] ) from the left by @xmath189 and from the right by @xmath190 , then we arrive at @xmath191 where @xmath157 is defined in equation ( [ genno ] ) .
the limit @xmath95 is thus physically equivalent to the limit @xmath32 for @xmath33 .
we therefore have the following relation between @xmath192 and @xmath166 : @xmath193 and similarly between @xmath194 and @xmath195 : @xmath196 for example , for @xmath159 the definition ( [ quat-0 ] ) leads to @xmath197 this tells us that in the @xmath198 limit the quaternion @xmath166 reduces to the scalar point @xmath199 of @xmath10 .
moreover , we have @xmath200 , since @xmath180 as we saw above . on the other hand , from the definition ( [ quat-0 ] ) of @xmath166 we also have the following relation between the conjugate variables @xmath194 and @xmath201
: @xmath202 this tells us that in the @xmath203 limit the quaternion @xmath195 reduces to the scalar point @xmath204 of @xmath10 .
thus the case @xmath159 does indeed correspond to the measurement events .
the physical significance of the two remaining cases , namely @xmath160 and @xmath174 , can be verified similarly , confirming the set of results listed in ( [ setresto ] ) : @xmath205
substituting this and @xmath206 into eqs.@xmath37([nonvar - a ] ) and ( [ nonvar - b ] ) then immediately leads to the standard scores : @xmath207 this confirms the standard scores derived in the equations ( [ nonvar - a ] ) and ( [ nonvar - b ] ) of the previous subsection .    ' '' ''    ' '' ''    ' '' ''
so far i have assumed that randomness in the measurement results @xmath208 and @xmath209 originates entirely from the initial state @xmath6 representing the orientation of the 3-sphere . in other words ,
i have assumed that the local interaction of the detector @xmath210 with the random spin @xmath211 does not introduce additional randomness in the measurement result @xmath208 .
any realistic interaction between @xmath210 and @xmath211 , however , would inevitably introduce such a randomness , of purely local , experimental origin .
we can model this randomness by introducing an additional random variable , say @xmath212 $ ] , not dependent on @xmath6 .
physically we can think of @xmath213 as an alignment parameter between the detector bivector @xmath210 and the spin bivector @xmath211 , with @xmath214 representing the perfect alignment .
clearly , introduction of this additional random parameter will make all the bivectors and quaternions unnormalized , and the corresponding probability density function ( [ probdensi-8 ] ) would then represent a gaussian distribution 
provided we also assume that the orientation @xmath182 of @xmath215 itself is distributed non - uniformly between its values @xmath216 and @xmath217 . moreover , although the measurement results would then fall within the range @xmath218 , their mean value would be zero for a uniformly distributed @xmath6 , since the mean value of the product of the independent random variables @xmath219 and @xmath6 would then be the product of their mean values : @xmath220 more importantly , the standard scores computed above in equations ( [ standj ] ) and ( [ standi ] ) would not be affected by this more realistic random process @xmath221at
least for the special case of uniformly distributed @xmath6because they involve the ratios of the corresponding raw scores and standard deviations centered about the mean values @xmath222 : @xmath223    let us now try to understand the propagation of error within @xmath10 from this physically more realistic perspective . to this end , let the random variable @xmath224 be such that the measurement results @xmath225}$ ] remain as before , but the bivectors @xmath76 are subject to a random process @xmath221 such that @xmath226 with @xmath227}$ ] .
then the mean value @xmath228 and standard deviation @xmath229 of @xmath230 would be a bivector and a scalar : @xmath231 if we now take the detector bivector to be @xmath232 as before , then the measurement results can be identified as @xmath233 so that @xmath234 . since @xmath235 is a non - random bivector , errors generated within @xmath117 by the random process @xmath221 would stem entirely from the random bivector @xmath230 , and propagate linearly . in other words ,
the standard deviations within the random number @xmath117 due to the random process @xmath221 would be given by @xmath236 but since @xmath229 , as we noted , is a scalar , the typical error @xmath151 generated within @xmath117 due to the random process @xmath221 is a bivector . the standardized variable ( which must be used to compare the raw scores @xmath117 with other raw scores @xmath237 )
is thus also a bivector : @xmath238 .    as straightforward
as it is , the above conclusion may seem unusual .
it is important to recall , however , that in geometric algebra both scalars and bivectors are treated on equal footing .
they both behave as real - valued c - numbers , albeit of different grades . to appreciate the consistency and naturalness of the above conclusion ,
let @xmath239 be a continuous function generated by the geometric product of two bivectors @xmath240 and @xmath241 as before .
the natural question then is : how does a typical error in @xmath230 governed by the probability density ( [ probdensi-8])which can be represented by the 68% probability interval @xmath242\label{int-1no}\ ] ] as shown in the fig.@xmath37[fig-88]propagate from the random bivector @xmath230 to the random scalar @xmath117 , through the function @xmath243 ? to answer this question we note that the two end points of the interval ( [ int-1no ] ) represent two points , say @xmath244 and @xmath245 , of the 3-sphere , which is a riemannian manifold .
the geometro - algebraic distance between the points @xmath244 and @xmath245 can therefore be defined , say , as @xmath246 moreover , from definition ( [ defofa-0 ] ) of @xmath117 and a first - order taylor expansion of the function @xmath247 about the point @xmath248 we obtain @xmath249 now it is evident that the slope @xmath250 of this line is a constant .
therefore the mean @xmath251 and the standard deviation @xmath151 of the distribution of @xmath252 can be obtained by setting @xmath253 and @xmath254 : @xmath255 the probability distribution of @xmath117 is thus represented by the 68% interval @xmath256.\label{int-2no}\ ] ] if we now set @xmath257 and thereby assume that @xmath230 is in fact the unit bivector @xmath258 with a vanishing mean , then we have @xmath200 and @xmath259 , as in equation ( [ a30 ] ) above .    finally , it is instructive to note that , geometrically , the propagation of error within @xmath10 is equivalent to a simple change in the perspective ( cf .
fig.@xmath37[fig-88 ] ) : @xmath260{\text{\;\;\;\;\;\;${f({\bf s})}$\;\;\;\;\;}}\;\ ; \underbrace {      \overbrace{m({\mathscr a})}^\text{scalar } \,\;\pm\ ;      \overbrace{\sigma({\mathscr a})}^\text{bivector }     } _ \text{quaternion}.\ ] ] in particular , the probability density of the scalar @xmath117 over @xmath10 corresponding to interval ( [ int-2no ] ) is equivalent to that of the bivector @xmath230 over @xmath10 corresponding to interval ( [ int-1no ] ) . with this , we are now ready to derive the epr - bohm correlations .
we begin by noting that , according to my model , epr - bohm correlations are correlations among the points of a parallelized 3-sphere . now , since we have assumed that initially there was 50/50 chance between the right - handed and left - handed orientations of the 3-sphere ( _ i.e. _ , equal chance between the initial states @xmath261 and @xmath262 ) , the expectation values of the raw scores @xmath72 and @xmath73 vanish identically . on the other hand ,
as discussed above , the correlation between these raw scores ( or their first product moment coefficient _  la _ pearson ) can be obtained only by computing the covariance between the corresponding standardized variables @xmath263 and @xmath264 , which gives @xmath265 \notag \\ & = \lim_{\,n\,\gg\,1}\left[\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k\,=\,1}^{n}\ , \left\{\,a_{\mu}\;l_{\mu}(\lambda^k)\,\right\}\,\left\{\,b_{\nu}\;l_{\nu}(\lambda^k)\,\right\}\right ] \notag \\ & = \,-\,g_{\mu\nu}\,a_{\mu}\,b_{\nu}\,-\lim_{\,n\,\gg\,1}\left[\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k\,=\,1}^{n}\ , \left\{\,\epsilon_{\mu\nu\rho}\;a_{\mu}\,b_{\nu}\;l_{\rho}(\lambda^k)\,\right\}\right ] \notag \\ & = \,-\,g_{\mu\nu}\,a_{\mu}\,b_{\nu}\,-\lim_{\,n\,\gg\,1}\left[\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k\,=\,1}^{n}\ , \lambda^k\right]\left\{\,\epsilon_{\mu\nu\rho}\;a_{\mu}\,b_{\nu}\;d_{\rho}\,\right\ } \notag \\ & = \,-\,g_{\mu\nu}\,a_{\mu}\,b_{\nu}\,-\,0\ , , \label{corwedid}\end{aligned}\ ] ] where i have used algebra defined in ( [ wh - o88 ] ) and the relation ( [ ojs ] ) .
consequently , as explained in the paragraph just below eq.@xmath37([stan ] ) , when the raw scores @xmath0 and @xmath1 are compared , their product moment will inevitably yield @xmath8\ , = \,-\,g_{\mu\nu}\,a_{\mu}\,b_{\nu}\ , , \label{darcor}\ ] ] since the correlation between the raw scores @xmath266 and @xmath118 is equal to covariance between the standard scores @xmath267 and@xmath268 .
so far in this section we have put no restrictions on the metric tensor , which , in the normal coordinates centered at a point of @xmath10 would be of the form @xmath269 in other words , the algebra ( [ wh - o88 ] ) we have used in the derivation of correlation ( [ darcor ] ) is a general clifford algebra , with no restrictions placed on the quadratic form . on the other hand ,
if the codomain of the measurement functions @xmath72 is taken to be a parallelized 3-sphere , then the above metric tensor specializes to the euclidean metric @xmath270 , because the riemann curvature tensor of a parallelized 3-sphere vanishes , inducing a non - vanishing torsion .
this case corresponds to the geometry of the group su(2 ) and specializes the correlation ( [ darcor ] ) to exhibit maximum strength : @xmath271 which in turn manifests the sensitivity of @xmath72 and @xmath73 to spinorial sign changes . to appreciate the significance of these changes , recall from subsection ii@xmath37a that a parallelized 3-sphere is a set of unit quaternions of the form @xmath272 with @xmath18 being the rotation angle .
it is easy to check that @xmath30 respects the following rotational symmetries : @xmath273 thus @xmath30 correctly represents the state of a body that returns to itself only after even multiples of a @xmath137 rotation .
it is very important to appreciate that the strong correlation derived in ( [ robisanan ] ) are correlation among the points of a parallelized 3-sphere , @xmath10 , taken as the codomain of the measurement functions @xmath11 .
thus the strength and the very existence of the epr - bohm correlation ( or of _ any _ correlation for that matter ) stem entirely from the topological properties of the codomain of the measurement functions @xmath11 .
had we chosen the codomain of @xmath11 to be any manifold other than a parallelized 3-sphere , the resulting correlation would not have been as strong as @xmath274 .
returning to the expectation value ( [ darcor ] ) in its most general form we can now proceed to derive the bell - chsh - type bound on possible correlations . to this end , consider four observation axes , @xmath87 , @xmath99 , @xmath88 , and @xmath275 , for the standard epr - bohm experiment .
then the corresponding chsh string of expectation values , namely the coefficient @xmath276 would be bounded by the constant @xmath277 , as discovered by tsirelson within the setting of clifford algebra applied to quantum mechanics in general . here
each of the joint expectation values of the raw scores @xmath89 and @xmath90 are defined as @xmath8,\label{exppeu}\ ] ] with the binary numbers such as @xmath72 defined by the limit @xmath278 thus @xmath72 and @xmath73 are points of a parallelized 3-sphere and @xmath279 evaluated in ( [ exppeu ] ) gives correlation between such points of the 3-sphere .
the correct value of the correlation , however , can not be obtained without appreciating the fact that the number @xmath89 is defined as a product of a @xmath6-_in_-dependent constant , namely @xmath74 , and a @xmath6-dependent random variable , namely @xmath76 .
thus the correct value of the correlation is obtained by calculating the covariance of the corresponding standardized variables @xmath280 as we discussed just below equation ( [ stan ] ) . in other words ,
correlation between the raw scores @xmath72 and @xmath73 is obtained by calculated the covariance between the standard scores @xmath263 and @xmath264 , as in equation ( [ corwedid ] ) above : @xmath281\,=\,-\,g_{\mu\nu}\,a_{\mu}\,b_{\nu}\,.\label{stand - exppeu}\ ] ] the correlation between the raw scores is thus necessarily equal to the covariance between the standard scores : @xmath282 \,=\lim_{\,n\,\gg\,1}\left[\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k\,=\,1}^{n}\ , { a}({\bf a},\,{\lambda}^k)\;{b}({\bf b},\,{\lambda}^k)\right]\,=\,-\,g_{\mu\nu}\,a_{\mu}\,b_{\nu}\,.\ , } \label{stoppsa}\ ] ] using this identity we can now rewrite the chsh string of expectation values ( [ b1 - 11 ] ) in two equivalent expressions , @xmath283\,+\ , \lim_{\,n\,\gg\,1}\bigg[\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k\,=\,1}^{n}\ , { \mathscr a}_{\bf a}({\lambda}^k)\,{\mathscr b}_{\bf b'}({\lambda}^k)\bigg]\ , \notag \\ & + \,\lim_{\,n\,\gg\,1}\bigg[\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k\,=\,1}^{n}\ , { \mathscr a}_{\bf
a'}({\lambda}^k)\,{\mathscr b}_{\bf b}({\lambda}^k)\bigg]\,-\ , \lim_{\,n\,\gg\,1}\bigg[\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k\,=\,1}^{n}\ , { \mathscr a}_{\bf a'}({\lambda}^k)\,{\mathscr b}_{\bf b'}({\lambda}^k)\bigg ] \label{probnonint}\end{aligned}\ ] ] and @xmath284\,+\ , \lim_{\,n\,\gg\,1}\bigg[\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k\,=\,1}^{n}\ , { a}_{\bf a}({\lambda}^k)\,{b}_{\bf b'}({\lambda}^k)\bigg]\ , \notag \\ & + \,\lim_{\,n\,\gg\,1}\bigg[\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k\,=\,1}^{n}\ , { a}_{\bf a'}({\lambda}^k)\,{b}_{\bf b}({\lambda}^k)\big\}\bigg]\,-\ , \lim_{\,n\,\gg\,1}\bigg[\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k\,=\,1}^{n}\ , { a}_{\bf a'}({\lambda}^k)\,{b}_{\bf b'}({\lambda}^k)\bigg ] .
\label{probnonrrint}\end{aligned}\ ] ] our goal now is to find the upper bound on these strings of expectation values .
to this end , we first note that the four pairs of measurement results occurring in the above expressions do not all occur at the same time .
let us , however , conform to the usual assumption of counterfactual definiteness and pretend that they do occur at the same time , at least counterfactually , with equal distribution .
this assumption allows us to simplify the above expressions as @xmath285 \label{probnontint}\ ] ] and @xmath286 .
\label{probnonint - b}\ ] ]    the obvious question now is : which of these two expressions should we evaluate to obtain the correct bound on @xmath287 ?
clearly , in view of the identity ( [ stoppsa ] ) both expressions would give one and the same answer .
thus it should not matter which of the two expressions we use to evaluate the bound .
but it is also clear from the discussion in subsections ii@xmath37c and ii@xmath37d that the correct bound on the expression ( [ probnontint ] ) involving the raw scores @xmath117 and @xmath118 can only be obtained by evaluating the expression ( [ probnonint - b ] ) involving the standard scores @xmath267 and @xmath288 . stated differently ,
if we tried to obtain the bound on @xmath287 by disregarding how the measurement results have been generated in the model statistically , then we would end up getting a wrong answer . by following the bell - chsh reasoning
blindly weatherall ends up making such a mistake . in the end
@xmath287 is a functional of a _ random _ variable , and as such proper statistical procedure tailored to my model must be employed for its correct evaluation .
this is an important point and the reader is urged to review the discussions in subsections ii@xmath37c and ii@xmath37d once again to appreciate its full significance .    with these remarks in mind
we proceed to obtain the upper bound on @xmath287 by evaluating the expression ( [ probnonint - b ] ) as follows . since the standard scores @xmath289 and @xmath290 appearing in this expression represent two independent equatorial points of the 3-sphere
, we can take them to belong to two disconnected `` sections '' of @xmath10 ( _ i.e. _ , two disconnected 2-spheres within @xmath10 ) , satisfying @xmath291\,=\,0\ , \;\;\;\forall\;\,{\bf
r}\;\,{\rm and}\;\,{\bf r'}\,\in\,{\rm i\!r}^3,\label{com}\ ] ] which is equivalent to anticipating a null outcome along the direction @xmath292 exclusive to both @xmath4 and @xmath293 . if we now square the integrand of equation ( [ probnonint - b ] ) , use the above commutation relations , and use the fact that all bivectors square to @xmath25 , then the absolute value of @xmath287 leads to the following variance inequality : @xmath294},\label{yever}\end{aligned}\ ] ] where the classical commutators @xmath295 \,=\,-\,a_{{\bf a}\times{\bf a'}}(\lambda ) \label{aa - potorsion-666}\ ] ] and @xmath296\,=\,-\,b_{{\bf b'}\times{\bf b}}(\lambda)\label{bb - potor}\ ] ] are the geometric measures of the torsion within @xmath10 .
thus , it is the non - vanishing torsion @xmath297 within the parallelized 3-sphere  the parallelizing torsion which makes its riemann curvature tensor vanish  that is ultimately responsible for the strong quantum correlation .
we can see this at once from eq.@xmath37([yever ] ) by setting @xmath298 , and in more detail as follows : using definitions ( [ dumtit-1 ] ) and ( [ dumtit-2 ] ) for @xmath299 and @xmath300 and making a repeated use of the bivector identity @xmath301 specialized for the metric @xmath85 on @xmath10 , the above inequality for @xmath287 can be further simplified to @xmath302 } \notag \\ & \leqslant\sqrt{\!4 - 4\,({{\bf a}}\times{\bf a'})\cdot({\bf b'}\times{{\bf b}})- 4\!\lim_{\,n\,\gg\,1}\left[\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k\,=\,1}^{n}\lambda^k\right]{{\bf d}}({\bf z } ) } \notag \\ & \leqslant\,2\,\sqrt{\,1-({{\bf a}}\times{\bf a ' } ) \cdot({\bf b'}\times{{\bf b}})\,-\,0\,}\,,\label{before - opppo-666}\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath303 , and  as before  i have used the relation ( [ ojs ] ) between @xmath304 and @xmath305 from subsection ii@xmath37b . finally , by noticing that @xmath306 is bounded by trigonometry as @xmath307 the above inequality can be reduced to the form @xmath308 which exhibits an extended upper bound on possible correlations .
thus , when in an epr - bohm experiment raw scores @xmath0 and @xmath1 are compared by coincidence counts , the normalized expectation value of their product @xmath309}{\big[c_{++}({\bf a},\,{\bf b})\,+\,c_{--}({\bf a},\,{\bf b } ) \,+\,c_{+-}({\bf a},\,{\bf b})\,+\,c_{-+}({\bf a},\,{\bf b})\big ] } \label{coniii}\ ] ] is predicted by my model to respect , not the bell - chsh upper bound 2 , but the tsirelson upper bound @xmath277 , where @xmath310 _ etc._@xmath311represent the number of joint occurrences of detections @xmath312 along @xmath87 and @xmath81 along @xmath88 _
etc_.    this completes the presentation of my local , realistic , and deterministic model for the epr - bohm correlation .
with the successful model firmly in place , we are now in a position to understand why weatherall s model fails . to begin with ,
his model is based on a different representation of the rotation group .
it is in fact based , not on the spinorial rotation group su(2 ) , but something akin to its tensorial cousin so(3 ) , which is a group of all proper rotations in @xmath3 , _ insensitive _ to spinorial sign changes .
in fact , weatherall takes a rather odd space , namely @xmath313 , for the codomain of his measurement functions @xmath11 , and then introduces another projection map to arrive at the measurement results @xmath314 .
compared to my measurement functions ( [ 88-oi ] ) obtained through a smooth limiting process ( [ amanda ] ) , his two - step measurement process is rather artificial .
since his is not a simply - connected , parallelized codomain such as @xmath10 that remains closed under multiplication , it can not possibly satisfy the completeness criterion of epr .
it is therefore not surprising why weatherall is unable to find strong correlation among its points .
moreover , at the end of his two - step process his measurement results @xmath314 are no longer the image points within the codomain @xmath313 of his measurement functions .
this is in sharp contrast with the situation in my model , where my measurement results @xmath314 remain very much a part of the codomain @xmath10 of my measurement functions .
the reason why this comes about naturally within my model is because @xmath10 , the set of unit quaternions , is a simply - connected surface embedded in @xmath35 that is equipped with a _ graded _
basis made of both scalars and bivectors : @xmath315 thus the scalars @xmath314 are as much a part of @xmath10 as the bivectors @xmath316 are , regulated by these unified basis .
i am tempted to quip : _ what nature has joined together , let no man put asunder_. by contrast weatherall s codomain is disconnected between the space @xmath313 of `` bivectors '' and the set @xmath314 of scalars .
his image points can thus be at best either bivectors or scalars , but not both .
it is a disjoint world , more like the world of quantum mechanics .    ' '' ''    ' '' ''    [ fig-55 ]    ' '' ''    let us , however , be more charitable to weatherall .
let us grant him the codomain of his measurement functions to be the connected real projective space @xmath317 , which is homeomorphic to the rotation group so(3 ) .
after all , he does mention the lie algebra @xmath318 in one of his footnotes .
so let us grant him the smooth one - step measurement process @xmath319 to reach the image subset @xmath314 .
this smooth map is well - defined within my model , since @xmath317 is simply the set @xmath10 of unit quaternions ( cf .
eq.@xmath37([nonoonpara ] ) ) with each point identified with its antipodal point .
the measurement results @xmath320 are thus limiting points of a quaternion , just as in equation ( [ amanda ] ) . the map that takes us from @xmath10 to @xmath317
can now be used to project the metric @xmath270 on @xmath10 onto @xmath317 to obtain the following induced metric on @xmath317 : @xmath321 further details of how this metric is obtained from the metric on @xmath10 can be found in section iii of ref.@xmath37 .
the two metrics @xmath270 and @xmath322 thus provide relative measures of geodesic distances on the manifolds @xmath10 and @xmath317 , respectively . substituting the metric on @xmath317 into equation ( [ corwedid ] ) the correlation between the points of so(3 )
then works out to be @xmath323 the two sets of correlations , ( [ robisanan ] ) and ( [ equawhichr-2 ] ) , are compared in fig.@xmath37[fig-55 ] .
the general correlation function @xmath279 derived in equation ( [ corwedid ] ) can thus serve to distinguish the geodesic distances @xmath324 on the groups su(2 ) and so(3 ) .
it is crucial to appreciate that even when we choose so(3 ) as the codomain of the function @xmath11 the correct statistical procedure that must be followed is the one described in subsections ii@xmath37c and ii@xmath37d above .
this is because , as weatherall himself notes , the lie algebras of su(2 ) and so(3 ) are isomorphic to each other . in other words , the local algebraic or tangent space structures on su(2 ) and so(3 ) are identical , but not their metrical structures in the sense of geodesic distances .
thus the above statistical procedure , tailored to the graded basis ( [ graded ] ) , leading up to the general expression ( [ darcor ] ) for correlations and beyond , is equally inevitable in the case of so(3 ) . comparing the two sets of correlations resulting from this procedure 
one for the prescription ( [ map-1 - 2 ] ) and other for the prescription ( [ map-1 - 3])it is then easy to see why we have lost the strong correlation in the second case .
we started out with @xmath10 as a codomain of @xmath11 and then , for the case of so(3 ) , we identified each point of @xmath10 with its antipodal point .
but in doing so we lost the following spinorial rotation symmetry satisfied by @xmath30 , as described in equations ( [ clacct ] ) and ( [ non - clacct ] ) above : @xmath325 in other words , by identifying the antipodal points of @xmath10 we lost the sensitivity to spinorial sign changes . as a result , @xmath30 now represents the state of a rotating body that returns to itself after any and all multiples of @xmath137 rotation : @xmath326 this is the real reason why we lost the strong correlation for the so(3 ) case .
the reason weatherall has argued for is an artifact of his bad choice of measurement functions .
it stems from a failure to appreciate the unified nature of the graded basis ( [ graded ] ) and the associated fact that the scalars @xmath314 and the bivectors @xmath316 occur as image points within the same codomain @xmath10 in my model .
thus the loss of correlation has nothing to do with the fact that ultimately the measurement functions must map to the image subset @xmath314 .
manifestly do _ in my model [ cf .
eqs.@xmath37([88-oi ] ) , ( [ 99-oi ] ) , and ( [ amanda ] ) ] . the raw scalar numbers @xmath0 and @xmath1 mapped to the image subset @xmath314according to my model  are indeed the numbers used by alice and bob for calculating the correlation in the usual manner . and
when , at the end of their experiment , they evaluate the statistical quantity @xmath287 involving these numbers as @xmath285,\ ] ] they will inevitably find that it exceeds the bound of 2 and extends to the bound of @xmath277 .
this conclusion may seem odd from the perspective of bell - type reasoning , but the evidence presented for it in subsection ii@xmath37f is incontrovertible .
in addition to the main issue discussed above , it is instructive to reflect on the broader reasons why weatherall s model fails .
we can in fact identify at least six erroneous steps which engender the failure of his model from the start :    1 .
choice of incomplete codomain of the measurement functions @xmath11 ( although with correct image points @xmath31 ) .
2 .   neglect of putting scalars and bivectors on equal footing within a single , comprehensive , real number system .
3 .   failure to implement a spinor representation of su(2 ) by recognizing the significance of spinorial sign changes .
4 .   lack of appreciation of the role played by the parallelizing torsion within @xmath10 for the existence and strength of strong correlations ( or not recognizing the discipline of parallelization as the true source of strong correlations ) .
failure to appreciate how errors propagate within @xmath10 , when taken as a codomain of the measurement functions
neglect of the correct statistical procedure in the derivations of both the correlation and the upper bound @xmath277 .
although interconnected , any one of these reasons is sufficient for the failure of weatherall s model . recognizing this ,
i must conclude that , contrary to first impressions , weatherall s thinly veiled criticism of my work is entirely vacuous .
i am grateful to lucien hardy for several months of correspondence which led to improvements in section ii@xmath37d .
i am also grateful to martin castell for his hospitality in the materials department of the university of oxford .
this work was funded by a grant from the foundational questions institute ( fqxi ) fund , a donor advised fund of the silicon valley community foundation on the basis of proposal fqxi - mga-1215 to the foundational questions institute .    ' '' ''    ' '' ''    [ fig-56 ]    ' '' ''
in this appendix i demonstrate explicit violations of both the chsh and the clauser - horne inequalities within the strictly local model described in the previous pages .
this will further lay bare the vacuity of weatherall s analysis . to this end , let us first confirm the following probabilistic predictions of quantum mechanics within our local model : @xmath328 here @xmath329 is the angle between @xmath87 and @xmath88 .
as is well known , confirming these probabilities is equivalent to confirming @xmath330 \notag \\ & = \,\frac{(p^{++}\,+\,p^{--})\times({\mathscr a}{\mathscr b}=+1 ) \,+\,(p^{-+}\,+\,p^{+-})\times({\mathscr a}{\mathscr b}=-1)}{p^{++}\,+\,p^{--}\,+\,p^{-+}\,+\,p^{+-}}\ , \notag \\ & = \,(p^{++}\,+\,p^{--}\,-\,p^{-+}\,-\,p^{+-})/(p^{++}\,+\,p^{--}\,+\,p^{-+}\,+\,p^{+-})\ , \notag \\ & = \,\frac{1}{2}\sin^2\left(\frac{\eta_{{\bf a}{\bf b}}}{2}\right)\ , + \,\frac{1}{2}\sin^2\left(\frac{\eta_{{\bf a}{\bf b}}}{2}\right)\ , -\,\frac{1}{2}\cos^2\left(\frac{\eta_{{\bf a}{\bf b}}}{2}\right)\ , -\,\frac{1}{2}\cos^2\left(\frac{\eta_{{\bf a}{\bf b}}}{2}\right)\,=\,-\,\cos\eta_{{\bf a}{\bf b}}\ , , \label{corappenir}\end{aligned}\ ] ] which is the strong correlation ( [ robisanan ] ) predicted by our local model ( see also ref.@xmath37 ) . to confirm this result explicitly ,
suppose initially a pair of spins , @xmath331 and @xmath332 , is created in a singlet configuration , where @xmath333 is a random direction about which the spins are rotating at the moment of their creation , and @xmath182 is their initial state , which , in our model , is taken to be the orientation of a parallelized 3-sphere within which the events @xmath117 and @xmath118 are occurring .
at a later time , @xmath334 , let alice and bob detect the spins with detectors @xmath240 and @xmath335 , respectively .
thus , at time @xmath334 , the spin bivectors @xmath336 and @xmath337 are projected by them onto the detector bivectors @xmath240 and @xmath335 , respectively . then
, as we defined in equations ( [ 88-oi ] ) and ( [ 99-oi ] ) above , we have the following measurement results [ cf . also eq.@xmath37([amanda ] ) ] : @xmath338 and @xmath339 let me stress once again that the measurement results @xmath72 and @xmath73 as defined above , in addition to being manifestly realistic , are strictly local and deterministically determined numbers within the 3-sphere .
in fact , they are not even contextual .
alice s measurement result @xmath72although it refers to a freely chosen direction @xmath87depends only on the initial state @xmath6 ; and likewise , bob s measurement result @xmath73although it refers to a freely chosen direction @xmath88depends only on the initial state @xmath6 . in other words , they are statistically independent events within @xmath10 .    now , for the purposes of our calculations below , it is convenient to make a note of the following useful identities : @xmath340 thus , with @xmath333 uniformly distributed in @xmath3 , the measurement results ( [ 888-oi ] ) and ( [ 999-oi ] ) can be expressed equivalently as @xmath341 and @xmath342 note again that measurement functions @xmath343 and @xmath344 are manifestly local , precisely as demanded by bell .
apart from the _ common causes _ @xmath6 and @xmath333 , their values depend _ only _ on @xmath87 and @xmath88 , respectively , and nothing else .
moreover , since @xmath333 is uniformly distributed within @xmath3 and @xmath6 has 50/50 chance of being @xmath31 , their averages vanish : @xmath345    let us confirm this averaging conditions in some more detail by explicitly rewriting equations ( [ 888-oi ] ) and ( [ 999-oi ] ) as @xmath346 here @xmath347 ; @xmath348 is the angle between @xmath87 and @xmath349 ; @xmath350 ; and @xmath351 . now , since @xmath352 is a _ random _ unit vector in @xmath3 , the quantity @xmath353
, being a function of this random variable , acts as a loaded die , taking values in the interval @xmath354}$ ] , with 50% chance of landing on its face marked@xmath355 : @xmath356 with 50% chance for the occurrence be the probability density function defined over a 2-sphere of unit radius with respect to a fixed reference vector @xmath357 , for observing a measurement result @xmath358 or @xmath359 : @xmath360\ , .
\notag\ ] ] for the purposes of our calculation a particular vector @xmath352 on the 2-sphere can be specified by the angle @xmath348 in the range @xmath361}$ ] with respect to the fixed vector @xmath87 .
consequently , we can calculate the probability @xmath362 of occurrence of a result @xmath358 or @xmath25 by integrating over @xmath363 as follows : @xmath364 where @xmath365 is the differential solid angle on the 2-sphere , with @xmath366 being the azimuthal angle from the @xmath367-axis and @xmath348 being the polar angle from @xmath357 .
now it is evident from eq.@xmath37([888999-oi ] ) that for the result @xmath358 the angle @xmath348 must fall in the range @xmath368}$ ] for @xmath45 , and in the range @xmath369}$ ] for @xmath46 .
consequently , the probability of observing @xmath358 is @xmath370 similarly , it is evident from eq.@xmath37([888999-oi ] ) that for the result @xmath359 the angle @xmath348 must fall in the range @xmath369}$ ] for @xmath45 , and in the range @xmath368}$ ] for @xmath46 , with the probability density remaining positive : @xmath371 . consequently , the probability of observing @xmath359 is @xmath372 these probabilities [ and the corresponding odds for @xmath373
are confirmed in the event - by - event simulation described in fig.@xmath37[fig-57 ] . ]
@xmath374 and similarly for @xmath375 .
note that for a fixed orientation @xmath6 , say @xmath45 , @xmath376 has only 25% chance of landing on its face marked @xmath80 .
but for @xmath45 _ or _
@xmath46 , which is equivalent to the possibilities @xmath377 _ or _
@xmath378 in the @xmath379 part of @xmath343 , @xmath380 has further 25% chance of landing on its face @xmath80 , because @xmath45 _ or _ @xmath46 are two mutually exclusive possibilities .
consequently , the die @xmath380 has exactly 50/50 chance of landing on its faces @xmath80 or @xmath25 in general .
thus , the measurement outcomes @xmath358 or @xmath25 observed by alice ( regardless of bob ) is a result of a throw of the die @xmath380 , which has 50/50 chance of landing on its face marked @xmath80 or @xmath25 , depending on the values of @xmath348 .
one can confirm these odds for @xmath380 in a computer simulation , as in fig.@xmath37[fig-57 ] .
the question now is : how do the actual values @xmath117 and @xmath118 of the functions @xmath343 and @xmath344 come about within the 3-sphere when they are observed _ simultaneously _ by alice and bob ? to answer this question , recall
that 3-sphere remains closed under multiplication , with its points represented by quaternions of the form ( [ defi-2 ] ) , and @xmath117 and @xmath118 are limiting values of such quaternions .
therefore the values @xmath117 and @xmath118 observed by alice and bob are constrained by the value @xmath381 of the product @xmath382 , which is a limiting value of the _ product _ quaternion : @xmath383,\label{ntt-2}\ ] ] where i have omitted explicit reference to @xmath6 in the rhs because it drops out from the product .
let me stress again that , since @xmath10 remains closed under multiplication , a limit like this one is the only legitimate way of determining the correct values of @xmath117 , @xmath118 , and @xmath384 , since all three of them are constrained to be what they possibly could be by the very geometry and topology of the 3-sphere . in other words , by taking the orientation @xmath6 of @xmath10 as the initial state of the spin system , we have in fact taken the entire geometry and topology of @xmath130 as the _ common cause _ that determines the actual values @xmath117 and @xmath118 , which are thus dictated to be what they turn out to be by the product @xmath384 resulting in the limit ( [ ntt-2 ] ) . hence our goal is to find the correct product quaternion whose limit is the value @xmath385 or @xmath25 .    to this end , let us work out the product appearing on the rhs of the above limit equation explicitly , which gives @xmath386 although it may not be obvious at first sight , this product is necessarily a unit quaternion of the form ( [ defi-2 ] ) : @xmath387 in other words , the product ( [ mni - identity ] ) is a sum of a scalar part and a bivector part , and when its scalar part , @xmath388 , reduces to @xmath389 , its bivector part reduces to zero , because the coefficient , @xmath390 , of the bivector @xmath391 reduces to zero . in view of ( [ ntt-2 ] ) , ( [ mni - identity ] ) , and ( [ defi-3 ] )
it is thus clear that the limits @xmath392 or @xmath25 are equivalent to the limits @xmath393 but since @xmath333 is a uniformly distributed _ random _ unit vector in @xmath3 ,
the quantity @xmath394 is also a _ random _
variable , taking values from the interval @xmath354}$ ] : @xmath395 thus , just as @xmath380 in eq.@xmath37([notpr ] ) , @xmath394 is a die with certain propensities for landing on its faces @xmath80 or @xmath25 .
in particular , for a sufficiently large number of random vectors @xmath333 , the random variable @xmath394 has 47% chance of landing on its face marked @xmath25 for @xmath396 , and 47% chance of landing on its face marked @xmath80 for @xmath397 .
what is more , from the lhs of the conditions ( [ c-1 ] ) and ( [ c-2 ] ) , using the limits @xmath398 and @xmath399 , it is easy to verify that @xmath400 where the second result is due to the spinorial sign change that the quaternion @xmath401 undergoes with respect to the quaternion @xmath402 upon rotation by angle @xmath403 .
[ @xmath37it is worth noting here that weatherall s model is incapable of exhibiting such a change from @xmath404 to @xmath385 in the product of the observed numbers @xmath117 and @xmath118 .
his model has been deliberately manufactured to fail this first test , in anticipation of his intended goal . ]
the above results are of course two very special cases .
they are the cases when the measurement axes chosen by alice and bob happen to be aligned or anti - aligned with each other . in more general cases ,
when the measurement axes of alice and bob happen to subtend angles different from @xmath405 or @xmath172 , it takes a bit more effort to deduce what values the results @xmath117 and @xmath118 and their product @xmath384 within @xmath10 would turn out to have .
in fact , because @xmath394 is a random variable , in more general cases statistical considerations are inevitable .
the question we must ask in the general cases is the following : given the random variable @xmath394 taking values in the interval @xmath354}$ ] , what are the chances  as functions of the angle @xmath329 between @xmath87 and @xmath88for the occurrences of the events @xmath385 and @xmath404 ?
the answer to this question can be obtained by computing the following set of conditional probabilities : @xmath406 where the random variable @xmath394which ( as we saw above ) can be thought of as a loaded die  is now given by @xmath407 in the form of eq.@xmath37([defi-3 ] ) , this is the scalar part of the product of the following two manifestly local quaternions : @xmath408 where @xmath409 and @xmath410 are the normalizing factors . needless to say , @xmath411 specified in eq.@xmath37([c-23-want ] ) is the same as that specified in eqs.@xmath37([c-1 ] ) and ( [ c-2 ] ) apart from the phase shifts @xmath412 , @xmath413 , @xmath414 , and @xmath415 .
these phase shifts contribute to the rotations of the product quaternion about the random vector @xmath416 [ which is different in general from the vectors @xmath417 and @xmath418 .
they are simply numerical constants , independent of the parameter vectors @xmath87 and @xmath88 , or of the random vector @xmath333 .
they are thus parts of the geometry of the 3-sphere .
together with @xmath333 , they form what bell referred to as the `` past causes . ''    ' '' ''    ' '' ''    ' '' ''    in terms of the product of the quaternions ( [ quat - aaa ] ) and ( [ quat - bbb ] ) , we are now in a position to express the measurement results @xmath343 and @xmath344 , and their product @xmath381 , in the following manifestly local - realistic forms : @xmath419 here the vector @xmath416 depends on both @xmath417 and @xmath420 , as well as on the other past causes .
although we do not require its explicit expression , it can be easily worked out by evaluating the geometric product of the quaternions @xmath421 and @xmath422 .
the 3-sphere analogue of bell s factorizability condition then appears as @xmath423 which , in the measurement limits ( [ eieipo ] ) and ( [ eieilo ] ) , reduces to the factorization of the corresponding scalar values : @xmath424 needless to say that the constraints ( [ nimpo-1 ] ) and ( [ nimpo-2 ] ) , which are manifestations of the geometry and topology of the 3-sphere , put strong restrictions on the possible values of the phase shifts @xmath412 , @xmath413 , @xmath414 , and @xmath415 . one possible set of their values in degrees is @xmath425 . with these values ,
the scalar parts of @xmath343 and @xmath344 are given by @xmath426 and @xmath427,respectively , whereas the scalar part @xmath411 of @xmath381 is the one stated in equation ( [ c-23-want ] ) .    ' '' ''    ' '' ''    [ fig-60 ]    ' '' ''    as depicted in fig.@xmath37[fig-56 ] , ( [ eieipo ] ) , ( [ eieilo ] ) , and ( [ eieioo ] ) are the explicit expressions of the three points of the 3-sphere we have been looking for . using these expressions we can now compute the probabilities for the occurrences of simultaneous events at the two ends of the epr experiment : @xmath428 , @xmath429 , @xmath430 , and @xmath431 . from the factorizability conditions ( [ nimpo-1 ] ) and ( [ nimpo-2 ] ) it is easy to see , however , that in the measurement limits these probabilities are causally constrained by the respective values of @xmath411 , as indicated in eqs.@xmath37([ghp-1 ] ) to ( [ ghp-4 ] ) .
thus , for example , the probability of the simultaneous occurrence of the results @xmath359 and @xmath432 is given by the probability of the die @xmath411 landing on its face marked @xmath25 .
the results of numerical computations of such probabilities are illustrated in fig.@xmath37[fig-57 ] .
they turn out to be as follows : @xmath433 as described in eq.@xmath37([corappenir ] ) , the correlation predicted by our local model can now be readily calculated as follows : @xmath434 this correlation can also be computed directly in the simulation described in fig.@xmath37[fig-57 ] .
the result is depicted in fig.@xmath37[fig-59 ] .    ' '' ''    ' '' ''    ' '' ''    let me stress that the above correlation is produced entirely within a strictly local and deterministic model of the physical reality . as we have already noted several times , the measurement results @xmath343 and @xmath344 defined in ( [ eieipo ] ) and ( [ eieilo ] ) are manifestly local . moreover , the product quaternions @xmath435 , and hence their scalar limits @xmath436 , are intrinsically factorizable , as shown in equations ( [ nimpo-1 ] ) and ( [ nimpo-2 ] ) . @xmath343 and @xmath344 are thus determined by a common cause 
namely , the geometry and topology of the 3-sphere  and the local vectors @xmath87 and @xmath88 . in practical terms , this common cause is translated into the set @xmath437 . the actual measurement results @xmath117 and @xmath118 observed by alice and bob are thus only dependent on these common causes and the local vectors .    for completeness ,
let me also note that the above correlation gives rise to the following string of expectation values : @xmath438 it is well known that the right - hand - side of the above equation violates the celebrated bell - chsh inequality .
it is worth noting here that the local - realistic model described above violates not only the bell - chsh inequality , but also the clauser - horne inequality : @xmath439 to appreciate this , recall the following predictions of our local model : @xmath440 these predictions are the same as the ones stated in eqs.@xmath37([lesson-1 ] ) to ( [ lesson])which , in turn , are the same as those predicted by quantum mechanics .
consequently , clauser - horne inequality is inevitably violated by our local model .
it is also worth recalling here that once the topology of the codomain of the measurement functions is correctly specified , not only the epr - bohm correlation , but also the correlations predicted by the rotationally non - invariant quantum states such as the ghz states and the hardy state  and in fact those predicted by _ all _ quantum states  can be reproduced exactly in a purely classical , local - realistic manner .
thus , contrary to the widespread belief , the correlations exhibited by such states are not irreducible quantum effects , but purely local - realistic , topological effects .
needless to say , this vindicates einstein s suspicion that quantum state merely describes statistical ensemble of physical systems , and not the individual physical system .
it is this inevitable conclusion that weatherall is resisting .
the above results once again confirm the fact that epr - bohm correlations are local - realistic correlations among the points of a parallelized 3-sphere . as we saw in section ii , however , this fact can be expressed more elegantly by understanding how random errors propagate within a parallelized 3-sphere . in particular
, we saw that epr - bohm correlations can be derived by recognizing that the raw scores @xmath72 and @xmath73 are generated within @xmath10 with _ different _ bivectorial scales of dispersion , and hence the correct correlation between them can be determined only by calculating the covariation of the corresponding standardized variables @xmath76 and @xmath77 : @xmath441 \,=\lim_{\,n\,\gg\,1}\left[\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i\,=\,1}^{n}\ , { \bf l}({\bf a},\,\lambda^i){\bf l}({\bf b},\,\lambda^i)\right]\,=\,-\,{\bf a}\cdot{\bf b}\ , , \label{afort}\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath442 and the standardized variables are defined as @xmath443}\,= \frac{\,{\mathscr a}({\bf a},\,\lambda)\,-\,m({\mathscr a})}{\sigma[\,{\mathscr a}({\bf a},\,\lambda)]}\,.\ ] ] note that this definition holds for any point @xmath166 of @xmath10 , and not just for the limiting point @xmath444 @xmath445 obtained in equation ( [ amanda ] ) . the epr - bohm correlations @xmath446 are thus correlations between any two points @xmath166 and @xmath447 of @xmath10 , with the scalar points @xmath92 and @xmath448 being only a special case .
it is also noteworthy that the correlation between the raw scores @xmath72 and @xmath73 is determined in eq.@xmath37([afort ] ) by calculating their covariance divided by the product of their standard deviations @xmath449}$ ] and @xmath450}$ ] : @xmath451\;\sigma[\,{\mathscr b}({\bf b},\,\lambda)\,]\,=\ , -\,{\bf d}({\bf a}){\bf d}({\bf b})\,=\,(-i\cdot{\bf a})(+i\cdot{\bf b } ) \,=\,{\bf a}{\bf b}\,=\,{\bf a}\cdot{\bf b}\,+\,{\bf a}\wedge{\bf b}\,.\ ] ] this product , however , is precisely the rotor that quantifies the twist in the fibration of the 3-sphere .
its value varies from @xmath80 for @xmath452 to @xmath25 for @xmath453 and back , producing the correct combination of observed probabilities .
it should be evident from the above results that there is a valuable lesson to be learned from weatherall s analysis : an explicit , constructive , quantitatively precise physical model x can not be undermined by repudiating its distorted misrepresentation y , even by appealing to a formal theorem ( especially when that theorem is grounded on unphysical assumptions ) .
such a strategy only serves to exemplify an elementary logical fallacy  namely , the straw - man fallacy .
inspired by the simulation of the 3-sphere model by chantal roth discussed in the previous appendix , michel fodje has produced another explicit , event - by - event simulation of the model that is worth elaborating on here .
while the simulation by chantal roth is primarily based on the joint probability density function @xmath454 defined in ( [ c-23-want ] ) , the simulation by michel fodje is based on the individual probability density functions @xmath455 and @xmath456 . from footnote 1 above we see that the individual probability density functions @xmath457 satisfy the relation @xmath458 with respect to any fixed vector @xmath87 .
this suggests that the constraints @xmath459 for arbitrary angles @xmath460 and @xmath461 should play a crucial role in dictating the integrity and strength of the correlation between the results @xmath462 and @xmath463 , for any given angle @xmath464}$ ] . according to these constraints the probability densities @xmath465 and @xmath466 for observing the measurement results @xmath462 and @xmath463 depend on the common parameter @xmath467 , just as they depend on the common random vector @xmath333 . this in turn suggests that we may treat @xmath467 as an additional random parameter , and take the set @xmath468 as the complete or initial state of our physical system . given this complete state , the outcomes of measurements are deterministically determined by the topological constraints within the 3-sphere . from a geometrical point of view , the parameter @xmath467 links two disconnected `` sections '' of @xmath10 ( _ i.e. _ , two `` orthogonal '' 2-spheres within @xmath10 ) defined by the bivectors @xmath469 and @xmath470 , by means of the constraints ( [ con - michel ] ) [ see fig.@xmath37[fig-588778 ] for the relationship between these two 2-spheres ] .          with these considerations ,
we define the measurement functions simply as @xmath471\ , , \label{mmm999-oi}\\ \text{and}\;\;\;s^3\ni\pm\,1\,=\,{\mathscr b}({\bf b};\,{\bf e}_o,\,\theta ) \,&=\,sign\{\,+\cos(\,\eta_{{\bf
b}{\bf e}_o}\,)\},\,\;\;\text{for a given}\,\;\theta\in[0,\,\pi/2]\,,\label{999mmm - oi}\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath333 and @xmath467 are common to both @xmath462 and @xmath463 , and @xmath87 and @xmath88 are specific instances of the vector @xmath472 .
once again let me stress the obvious that these functions define manifestly _ local _ measurement outcomes .
what is more , given the initial or complete state @xmath473 , the outcomes @xmath462 and @xmath463 are deterministically determined to be either @xmath80 or @xmath25 , for any freely chosen vectors @xmath87 and @xmath88 . here
@xmath333 is a random vector on @xmath363 as defined before , and @xmath467 is a random angle , chosen from the interval @xmath474}$ ] .
the correlation is then calculated quite simply as @xmath475 \,=\,-\,{\bf a}\cdot{\bf b}\ , .
\label{notafort}\end{aligned}\ ] ]          what is more , for the measurement functions defined in ( [ mmm999-oi ] ) and ( [ 999mmm - oi ] ) the probabilities of observing the specific outcomes @xmath80 or @xmath25 turn out to be exactly @xmath476 , with 100% detector efficiency . in other words ,
every particle that emerges in a state @xmath477 defined by the set ( [ thesette ] ) ends up being detected by the detector , just as in the previous simulation .
on the other hand , the probabilities of jointly observing the results @xmath462 and @xmath463 turn out to be exactly those predicted by quantum mechanics [ cf .
eqs.@xmath37([lesson ] ) to ( [ lesson-6 ] ) ] .
consequently , not only the correlations between these results turn out to be those predicted by quantum mechanics [ cf . eq.@xmath37([molnot ] ) ] , but also the clauser - horne inequality is necessarily violated in this simulation , just as it is violated in the previous simulation [ cf . eq.@xmath37([pp2 ] ) ] .

"heterogeneous wireless networks , comprising of small cell base stations ( sbss ) underlying the macrocellular network , is a promising solution to improve capacity , coverage and users quality - of - experience ( qoe ) @xcite . at the same time
, the unplanned deployment of dense small cells further renders these problems very challenging @xcite @xcite .
recently , content caching at the network edge ( i.e. , sbss , user devices etc . )
has been proposed as a cost - efficient solution to offload cellular / backhaul traffic , while satisfying users qoe and alleviating network congestion @xcite @xcite .
although content caching and spectrum sharing received significant attention in recent years , most of the existing works consider spectrum allocation and caching separately , and little work has been done in exploring their joint benefits . in this respect
, @xcite proposes a collaborative caching mechanism for wireless multimedia streaming exploiting storage and bandwidth auctions .
however , the distribution of caches is considered fixed . meanwhile , @xcite studies the gains of caching in a stochastically distributed small cell scenario , where the effects of storage size and file popularity are investigated .
furthermore , the work in @xcite characterizes the outage probability in small cell networks for uniform content distribution .
however , the impact of spectrum has not been addressed in @xcite @xcite .
+ unlike @xcite , this letter characterizes the outage probability in serving user requests over a coverage area by jointly exploiting spectrum and caching . by considering the distribution of macro cellular base stations ( mbss ) ( with large cache ) and sbss ( with limited cache ) as poisson point processes ( ppps ) , we derive a closed form expression of the outage probability for a given content distribution .
the outage probability is defined as the probability of not satisfying users requests over a given coverage area , as a function of signal - to - interference ratio ( sir ) , cache size and sbss density .
we emphasize that the proposed model is pessimistic in the sense that it provides a lower bound on the overall network performance and focuses on the regime with large sbs density . for spectrum allocation
, we define the spectrum access factor as a measure of spectrum accessed by the sbss .
we also show the interplay of caching and spectrum sharing in such heterogeneous networks , drawing insights on the tradeoff between cache size and spectrum access factor , for different content popularity models .
consider the downlink transmission of a two - tier cellular network comprising of sbss , underlying mbss in a two - dimensional euclidean plane @xmath0 as shown in fig .
[ fig : net_diagram5 ] .
hereafter , we will use the subscripts `` @xmath1 '' and `` @xmath2 '' to refer to the system variables associated to the small- and macro - base - stations , respectively .
we assume that mbss are deployed according to a homogeneous ppp , @xmath3 with intensity @xmath4 ( mbss per square meter ) , where @xmath5 represents the spatial location of the @xmath6-th mbs ( in relation to the origin ) .
similarly , sbss distribution is modeled as a homogeneous ppp , @xmath7 , with intensity @xmath8 ( sbss per square meter ) , such that @xmath9 and @xmath10 denotes the spatial location of the @xmath11-th sbs .
we consider a spectrum configuration where the bandwidth @xmath12 is divided into @xmath13 equal sub - channels and each sbs randomly ( and independently ) accesses @xmath14 sub - channels , such that @xmath15 $ ] .
hereafter , @xmath16 is referred to as spectrum access factor .
the transmit power of mbs and sbs is represented by @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively where @xmath19 and @xmath20 is the maximum transmit power of mbs and sbs , respectively .
+ let each mbs be equipped with a large storage to cache contents from a given library @xmath21 , with size @xmath22 .
all library contents are of equal size ( in bits ) .
each sbs , in turn , is equipped with a cache storage of size @xmath23 and stores a subset of library contents . for simplicity
, we express the cache size in terms of normalized cache size where @xmath24 .
let @xmath25 represent the specific content(s ) cached at the @xmath11-th sbs .
we assume that sbss cache contents following two different policies : a uniform caching policy ( ucp ) , where the sbss randomly caches contents regardless of their popularity , or popularity - based caching policy ( pcp ) , where the sbss hold the @xmath23 most popular contents . + we assume that a reference user  a mobile user  is located at the origin @xmath26 and analyze the system performance for the reference link assuming it requests a given content @xmath27 independently at each time slot .
we analyze two different distribution of users requests : ( i ) uniform , where the contents are equally popular , and ( ii ) zipf where the contents popularity follows a power - law distribution ( * ? ? ?
+    [ fig : net_diagram5 ]    we define a threshold distance @xmath28 and @xmath29 that specifies the maximum distance over which the mbs and sbs serves the user s content request respectively .
the reference user is associated to the nearest sbs with the cached content within @xmath29 .
if no sbs has cached the requested content , mbss may fulfill the user request . in this scenario ,
the user attempts to associate to the nearest mbs within @xmath28 such that @xmath30 . at each transmission , we assume a standard power loss propagation model with path loss exponent @xmath31 .
the multi - path effects are modeled as rayleigh fading whose gains @xmath32 are exponentially distributed with mean @xmath33 .
furthermore , we assume an interference - limited regime and therefore , neglect the effects of additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) . then , the sir is computed as : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the transmit power of @xmath36 , @xmath37 is the ( random ) distance of the reference link and @xmath38 is the interference experienced by the reference user .
the interference @xmath38 at the reference user is the interference from all the mbss and sbss transmitting on the same frequency . as the interference from sbss is a thinned ppp , @xmath39 with density @xmath40 , then the interference experienced by the reference user served by an sbs and mbs respectively
is given by :    [ eq : interference ] & i_o , = _
x_i _ p _ h_o , x_i^- + _
y_j _ \{o } p _
h_o , y_j^- , & + & i_o , = _ x_i _
h_o , x_i^- + _ y_j _ p _ h_o , y_j^- .
in this section , we derive a closed - form expression of the outage probability for serving user requests .
the analysis considers the content distribution in a static network where a single network realization considers @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 independently .
[ ssec : cache_hit_probability ] in order to define the cache hit probability , we first introduce a content replication @xmath44 defined as the probability that content @xmath27 is cached ( replicated ) at the sbs , expressed as : @xmath45 where @xmath27 is ordered by the content popularity ( i.e. @xmath46 is the most popular content , @xmath47 the second most popular and so on ) . as mentioned earlier ,
sbss employ two replication strategies , namely ucp and pcp . for ucp
, @xmath44 is the fraction of library contents stored by sbs ( i.e. , @xmath48 ) . for pcp ,
the sbss cache @xmath23 most popular contents . in this case
, @xmath44 is given by : @xmath49 user requests , represented by @xmath50 , are modeled as uniform or zipf distribution . while in the former user randomly requests library contents , the latter considers different file popularity .
for the zipf distribution , content requests are ranked from the most popular to the least such that the request for a content @xmath51 is : @xmath52 note that @xmath53 models the skewness of the popularity profile .
for @xmath54 the popularity profile is uniform over files , and becomes more skewed as @xmath53 grows larger .
is 0.8 and 1.2 for user - generated contents and video - on - demand contents respectively @xcite . ]
+ based on content replication , the cache hit probability is defined as the probability of existence of the content within @xmath29 or @xmath28 .
therefore , for a given reference user , the existence of the closest sbs within @xmath29 is given by : @xmath55    for the mbss , we proceed in a similar way , but considering that they have all contents in their library . then ,    _ & = 1 - ( r _ ) + & = 1 - e^- _ ( r_)^2 .    by considering the fact that the reference user always associates to the closest sbs having the requested content , the probability density function @xmath56 of the distance @xmath57 , given that the content @xmath27 exists within @xmath29 , is @xcite : @xmath58{0,0,1}{\beta p_c > 0}. \vspace{-0.1cm}\ ] ] for mbs ,
the probability density function @xmath59 is : @xmath60      let @xmath61 be the event that the requested content @xmath27 has been transmitted successfully given that @xmath27 has been cached by a sbs within @xmath29 .

the outage probability in serving a user requesting content @xmath27 is given by :    _ ( c ) = & _ ( c ) _ , ( c ) + ( 1 - _ ( c ) ) .
theorem [ coro_1 ] imply that if the content has been cached by a sbs within @xmath29 , the outage probability of serving the user request is given by .
otherwise , the mbs within @xmath28 serves the reference user with the desired content , given by .
therefore , the mean outage probability is the linear combination of and .
meanwhile , the average outage probability is given by : @xmath77
we present here a numerical analysis of the outage probability , validating our analytical results with monte - carlo simulations for a network grid of size @xmath78 .
we generate @xmath79 requests from a library of size @xmath80 according to the request distribution described in sec .
[ ssec : cache_hit_probability ] . for each request ,
the outage probability is evaluated over @xmath81 network realizations .
in addition , we assume @xmath82 while the maximum transmit powers of mbs and sbs are set to 43dbm and 23dbm , respectively .
[ fig : sbs_tradeoff ] shows the outage probability for various caching strategies as a function of sbs density by considering uniform and zipf content request distributions .
it can be clearly seen that the analytical results match very well the simulation results , thus validating the analytical expression . without caching , increasing @xmath8 only increases interference , resulting in an increased outage probability . when sbss cache contents , the outage probability varies with increasing @xmath8 depending on the content distribution . for each of the content distribution ,
the outage probability first increases before levelling off . under zipf distribution ,
the outage probability maximizes for smaller @xmath8 as sbss only cache the most popular contents . under uniform distribution ,
the outage probability is maximized for a relatively larger @xmath8 , thus requiring more sbss to fulfill user requests . in addition , the cache hit probability given by ( 7 ) is an increasing function of @xmath8 .
+    [ fig : sbs_tradeoff ]    fig .
[ fig : storage_bwtradeoff ] shows the tradeoff between cache size and bandwidth for different content distributions . in case of ucp
, the maximum outage probability is 0.2 for a large cache size . for a decreasing cache size , the outage probability increases under uniform distribution .
however , for pcp , the outage probability increases much slower as sbss cache the most popular contents .
meanwhile , for pcp , the maximum outage probability is 0.46 albeit utilizing the whole spectrum ( @xmath83 ) while uniform caching attains the maximum outage probability of 0.5 .
therefore , caching smartly requires less amount of spectrum to achieve the same cache hit probability .
hence , pcp makes use of the network resources more efficiently for a constrained cache size .
furthermore , pcp is preferred for a fixed bandwidth as it achieves the minimum outage probability .
finally , fig .
[ fig : threshold_tradeoff ] shows the impact of sir threshold on outage probability , showing that pcp relaxes the sir threshold requirement for a given outage probability .
furthermore , spectrum utilization without caching induces much higher outage probability than the joint cache - spectrum allocation .
[ fig : threshold_tradeoff ]
in this letter , we examined a cache - enabled small cell network underlying the macro cellular network , in which sbss strategically store contents . by considering the distribution of sbss to be a ppp , we analytically derived the outage probability of serving the requested content by jointly considering spectrum allocation and storage constraints .
in addition , we characterized the number of sbss required to satisfy a given cache hit probability for different content distributions .
this letter highlights the key tradeoff between cache size , node density and spectrum , underscoring the fact that larger cache size can be leveraged in conjunction with smaller spectrum access factor ." ," caching contents at the network edge is an efficient mean for offloading traffic , reducing latency and improving users quality - of - experience . in this letter 
 , we focus on aspects of storage - bandwidth tradeoffs in which small cell base stations are distributed according to a homogeneous poisson point process and cache contents according to a given content popularity distribution , subject to storage constraints . 
 we provide a closed - form expression of the cache - miss probability , defined as the probability of not satisfying users requests over a given coverage area , as a function of signal - to - interference ratio , cache size , base stations density and content popularity . 
 in particular , it is shown that for a given minimum cache size , the popularity based caching strategy achieves lower outage probability for a given base station density compared to uniform caching . 
 furthermore , we show that popularity based caching attains better performance in terms of cache - miss probability for the same amount of spectrum .    caching , heterogeneous networks , latency "
"current theoretical developments in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics have led to significant progress in the study of systems around states far from thermal equilibrium .
systems in nonequilibrium steady states ( ness ) are the simplest examples because the dynamics of their degrees of freedom @xmath0 under fixed control parameters @xmath1 can be statistically described by time - independent probability densities @xmath2 .
ness naturally occur in mesoscopic systems such as colloidal particles dragged by optical tweezeres , brownian ratches and molecular motors because of the presence of nonconservative or time - dependent forces @xcite . at these lengthscales fluctuations
are important so it is essential to establish a quantitative link between the statistical properties of the ness fluctuations and the response of the system to external perturbations . around thermal equilibrium
this link is provided by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem @xcite .
the generalization of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem around ness for systems with markovian dynamics has been achieved in recent years from different theoretical approaches @xcite .
the different generalized formulations of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem link correlation functions of the fluctuations of the observable of interest @xmath3 in the unperturbed ness with the linear response function of @xmath3 due to a small external time - dependent perturbation around the ness .
the observables involved in such relations are not unique but they are equivalent in the sense that they lead to the same values of the linear response function
. these theoretical relations may be be useful in experiments and simulations to know the linear response of the system around ness .
indeed the response can be obtaines from measurements entirely done at the unperturbed ness of the system of interest without any need to perform the actual perturbation .
nevertheless , the theoretical equivalence of the different observables involved in those relations does not translate into equivalent experimental accessibility : _
e.g. _ strongly fluctuating observables such as instantaneous velocities may lead to large statistical errors in the measurements @xcite .
besides , ness quantities themselves such as local mean velocities , joint stationary densities and the stochastic entropy are not in general as easily measurable as dynamical observables directly related to the degrees of freedom @xcite .
hence , before implementing the different fluctuation - response formulae in real situations it is important to test its experimental validity under very well controlled conditions and to assess the influence of finite data analysis . the experimental test of some fluctuation - dissipation relations has been recently done in refs .
@xcite for colloidal particles in toroidal optical traps .    in the present paper
we discuss the effects of the finite number of experimental data on the determination of the linear response function around a ness for a micron - sized system with markovian dynamics : a brownian particle in a toroidal optical trap . for this purpose
we perform the respective data analysis on the measurements reported in  @xcite . in sect .
[ sec : hs ] we briefly describe a generalized fluctuation - dissipation relation that has been derived for markovian dynamics around a ness exploiting the properties of the stationary density @xmath4 . in sect .

[ sec : gfd ] we discuss the two different kinds of finite - sampling effects that can appear in the computation of the differents terms involved in the fluctuation - dissipation relation .
we show that the generalized fluctuation - dissipation relation is verified experimentally when performing a careful data analysis , which takes into account these effects .
finally we present the conclusion .
the hatano - sasa relation provides a general identity for the transitions between either equilibrium or nonequilibrium steady states of markovian systems @xcite . in the following
we will focus on a langevin system with markovian dynamics described by a steady state probability density @xmath4 . when the system is subjected to a time - dependent variation of the control parameter @xmath5 between an initial time @xmath6 and a final time @xmath7
, the hatano - sasa identity reads @xmath8 where @xmath9 and the average @xmath10 is performed over an infinite number of realizations of a prescribed time - dependent protocol @xmath5 . from eq .
( [ eq : hatanosasa ] ) , prost _ et al . _ has directly derived a generalized fluctuation - dissipation relation that holds in the linear response regime around a ness @xcite @xmath11 in eq .
( [ eq : gfdtjpp ] ) @xmath12 is the linear response function of the observable @xmath13 due to a small external time - dependent perturbation @xmath14 around @xmath15 fixing an initial ness at time @xmath6 .
the averages @xmath16 and @xmath17 are performed over the perturbed and unperturbed processes , respectively .    in experiments the formal average involved in eq .
( [ eq : hatanosasa ] ) is not perfectly computed because of the finite number of independent realizations of @xmath5 . hence eq .  ( [ eq : hatanosasa ] ) allows one to estimate the experimental precision of ( [ eq : gfdtjpp ] ) computed from a given number of experimental data provided that one can measure the observable @xmath18 . in the next section
we tackle this problem for the experimental trajectories of a colloidal particle in a toroidal optical trap .     and undergoing a periodic potential @xmath19(b ) experimental profile of the observable @xmath20 defined in eq .
( [ eq : obs ] ) computed using the ness densities @xmath21 and @xmath22 around @xmath23 at fixed @xmath24.,title='fig : ' ]   and undergoing a periodic potential @xmath19(b ) experimental profile of the observable @xmath20 defined in eq .
( [ eq : obs ] ) computed using the ness densities @xmath21 and @xmath22 around @xmath23 at fixed @xmath24.,title='fig : ' ]
the brownian motion of a colloidal particle in a toroidal optical trap has become an experimental model to study the generalization of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem around a ness  @xcite .
this is because it is a system with a single translational degree of freedom where one can easily tune its relevant control parameters .
our experiment has been already described in detail in  @xcite so here we only explain it briefly .
the brownian motion of a spherical silica particle ( radius @xmath25 m ) immersed in water is confined on a thin torus of major radius @xmath26 m by a tightly focused laser beam rotating at 200 hz .
the water reservoir acts as a thermal bath at fixed temperature ( @xmath27c ) providing thermal fluctuations to the particle .
the viscous drag coefficient at this temperature is @xmath28 kg s@xmath29 .
the rotation frequency of the laser is so high that it is not able to trap continuously the particle in the focus because the viscous drag force of the surrounding water quickly exceeds the optical trapping force .
consequently , at each rotation the beam only kicks the particle a small distance along the circle of radius @xmath30 exerting a nonconservative force @xmath31 fn on it in the direction of the rotation .
thus , the particle motion is effectively confined on a circle : the angular position @xmath32 of its barycenter is the only relevant degree of freedom .
in addition , a static light intensity profile ( amplitude about @xmath33 of the total laser intensity  @xcite ) is created along the circle acting as a periodic potential @xmath34 of amplitude @xmath35 .
figure  [ fig:1](a ) depicts this experimental configuration .
we track the 2d particle position by video microscopy in order to measure the time evolution of @xmath32 .
thus for the experimentally accessible length and time scales the dynamics of @xmath36 is modeled by the first - order langevin equation @xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38 with amplitude @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 is a white noise process of zero mean and covariance @xmath42 \delta(t - s)$ ] . under these fixed conditions
the dynamics of @xmath36 settles into a ness whose probability density function @xmath23 is plotted in fig  [ fig:1](b ) ( solid black line ) .
in the following analysis we take @xmath43 as the single degree of freedom and @xmath44 as the main control parameter of the system . in this case the observable of interest involved in the fluctuation - dissipation relation ( [ eq : gfdtjpp ] ) is @xmath45 the experimental profile of @xmath20 , computed as a discrete three - point derivative of @xmath46 at two different ness around @xmath47 , is shown in fig  [ fig:1](b ) .
we focus on the response of the system after applying a small heaviside perturbation @xmath48 to @xmath47 at time @xmath6 : @xmath49 . in the experiment
this dynamical procedure is done by suddenly switching the laser power modulation as explained in @xcite .
this procedure yields the integrated response function , defined as @xmath50 where the average @xmath51 must be performed over the perturbed process at time @xmath52 .
then the integrated version of the generalized fluctuation - dissipation relation  ( [ eq : gfdtjpp ] ) is in this case @xmath53 we now study the effects of a finite number of realizations of the perturbation @xmath48 and the finite number of trajectories used to compute the averages @xmath51 and @xmath17 in eqs .
( [ eq : intresponse ] ) and ( [ eq : intgfdt ] ) .      as discussed in sect .
[ sec : hs ] , the hatano - sasa relation ( [ eq : hatanosasa ] ) can be used to estimate the error of the experimental computation of eq .
( [ eq : intgfdt ] ) when performing @xmath54 independent realizations of @xmath48 around the ness . in the case of the dynamical process defined by the heaviside perturbation @xmath55 at time @xmath6 , as done in the experiment , eq .
( [ eq : hatanosasa ] ) reads @xmath56 \right\rangle= 1.\ ] ] eq .
( [ eq : hs ] ) only depends on the initial values @xmath57 when the system is still in ness .
therefore , for a finite number of trajectories @xmath58 we introduce an estimator of the error of eq .
( [ eq : hs ] ) @xmath59 - 1\right|,\ ] ] where @xmath60 is the @xmath61-th sampled ness initial condition . fig .
[ fig:2](a ) shows the behavior of the error @xmath62 computed for @xmath63 ( the value realized in the dynamical experiment ) using @xmath58 experimental values of @xmath20 drawn from the ness distribution . for small @xmath64 100
the error is non - negliglible , @xmath65% , and this must be taken into account in the final accuracy of the generalized fluctuation - dissipation relation when comparing the left with the right - hand side of eq .
( [ eq : intgfdt ] ) using the experimenal data .
then as @xmath58 increases @xmath62 quickly converges to 0 : for @xmath66 the precision of eq .
( [ eq : hs ] ) found in the experiment is better than 1% .    ) for a finite number @xmath58 of realizations of @xmath48 .
( b ) estimate of the error of @xmath67 using eq .
( [ eq : finiteinitresponse ] ) for @xmath68 ness data.,title='fig : ' ] ) for a finite number @xmath58 of realizations of @xmath48 .
( b ) estimate of the error of @xmath67 using eq .
( [ eq : finiteinitresponse ] ) for @xmath68 ness data.,title='fig : ' ] +      according to the heaviside procedure for @xmath48 , in eqs .
( [ eq : intresponse ] ) and ( [ eq : intgfdt ] ) the initial condition @xmath69 for the perturbed process is sampled from the ness density @xmath23 .
then the integreated linear response function must formally satisfy the initial condition @xmath70 where the last equality is due to the normalization of @xmath71 .
we are interested in the effect of a finite number @xmath72 of initial values @xmath69 drawn from the inital ness on the estimate of @xmath73 .
it should be noted that in practice a small @xmath68 may significantly affect the computation of @xmath67 in eq .
( [ eq : initresponse ] ) because most of the positive values of @xmath20 lie in the region where @xmath23 is rarely sampled , as shown in fig .
[ fig:1](b ) . in fig .
[ fig:2](b ) we plot some values of the finite average @xmath74 where @xmath60 is the @xmath61-th initial condition at ness . as expected , for small @xmath68 , @xmath75 due to the fact that one samples mostly the negative values around the maximum of @xmath23 .
the convergence to the theoretical value @xmath76 is very slow : as @xmath68 increases @xmath77 becomes very sensitive to @xmath68 and large positive values of @xmath77 can be obtained .
the general trend is around @xmath76 , though .
then even for large @xmath68 one must be careful with the computation of the integrated response function since a large initial error of @xmath78 due to the use of the average @xmath79 may significantly propagate as @xmath52 increases .    in order to avoid the problem of the sensitivity to the initial condition , instead of using directly the average @xmath80 in eq .
( [ eq : intresponse ] ) , one can define an estimator @xmath81 satisfying the initial condition @xmath82 as required ideally by eq .
( [ eq : initresponse ] ) . in this way
the propagation of the initial error given by @xmath83 is suppressed at the beginning . an intuitive way to define @xmath84
can be outlined from the usual protocol to compute the integrated response function @xmath85 where the time @xmath86 is chosen such that @xmath87 and @xmath88 denotes the observable measured during the perturbed process .
notice that eq.[eq : chi ] is justified by the fact that in the case of an infinite number of samples @xmath89 , because of the time translational invariance of the ness .
in contrast when @xmath68 is finite , it is useful to take into account , in eq.[eq : chi ] , that @xmath90 and @xmath17 are performed independently the first on the perturbed trajectory @xmath91 and the second on the unperturbed ones @xmath92 , specifically @xmath93\ ] ] where @xmath94 is the number of unperturbed trajectories such @xmath95 . therefore eq.[eq : estimator ] can be rewritten @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the the instantaneous difference between a perturbed trajectory @xmath98 and an unperturbed one @xmath99 .
an example of this procedure is depicted in fig .
[ fig:3](a ) , where @xmath6 has been set equal to zero .
we see that for a given perturbed trajectory @xmath98 ( thick dashed red line ) , obtained after that @xmath48 has been applied , one should look for an unperturbed ness trajectory @xmath100 such that @xmath95 like the four unperturbed trajectories shown by the solid lines .

( [ eq : estimatorresponse ] ) for different values of @xmath68 and for fixed @xmath116 ( solid lines ) and @xmath105 ( dashed line ) .
as @xmath68 increases for @xmath116 the curves converge to a single profile which must correspond to that of @xmath117 ideally given by eq .
( [ eq : intresponse ] ) .
the additional conditional average done for @xmath105 smoothes the slightly fluctuating profile for @xmath104 ( thick solid blue line ) resulting in the thick dashed solid line . for comparison
we also show in the inset of fig .
[ fig:3](b ) the raw estimate of @xmath113 obtained using the average of eq .
( [ eq : finiteinitresponse ] ) for the same @xmath104 perturbed trajectories without correcting the effect of the initial sampling . in this case
the propagation of the initial large error of @xmath118 gives rise to a very poor estimate of the integrated response function for @xmath119 .
finally we proceed to test the theoretical fluctuation - dissipation relation ( [ eq : intgfdt ] ) for the experimental unperturbed ness trajectories of the brownian particle and those perturbed around ness .
for this purpose we compare the best estimate @xmath106 of @xmath117 done for @xmath104 and @xmath120 with the right - hand side of eq .
( [ eq : intgfdt ] ) .
the involved correlation function @xmath121 on the right - hand side is computed using unperturbed ness trajectories . in fig .
[ fig:3](c ) we compare @xmath106 with @xmath122 . besides , one can estimate the statistical error of the experimental @xmath117 at each @xmath123 by computing the standard deviation of @xmath124 over the @xmath125 possible choices of the unperturbed @xmath126 .
the standard deviation @xmath127 obtained in this way is also shown in fig .
[ fig:3](c ) showing that after following the careful procedure to estimate @xmath113 the relation @xmath128 is verified by the finite experimental data .
note that without the finite correction @xmath129 of the initial condition in eq .
( [ eq : estimatorresponse ] ) one would largely underestimate the direct measurement of the integrated response function leading to an apparent violation of eq .
( [ eq : intgfdt ] ) .
the results of the present paper are consistent with those of refs .
@xcite where two fluctuation - dissipation formulae equivalent to eq .
( [ eq : intgfdt ] ) but involving different observables from the one studied here are checked experimentally .
we have studied the influence of finite sampling in the computation of the linear response function of a brownian particle in a toroidal optical trap around a ness .
we have shown that there are two different effects that may lead to a very poor estimate of the experimental linear response function when the data analysis is not performed carefully .
this is an important point that must be assessed in general when applying in experiment and numerical simulations the different generalized fluctuation - dissipation formulae recently derived for ness .
99 reimann , phys . rep . 361 , * 57 * ( 2002 ) ." ," we study the effects of the finite number of experimental data on the computation of a generalized fluctuation - dissipation relation around a nonequilibrium steady state of a brownian particle in a toroidal optical trap . 
 we show that the finite sampling has two different effects , which can give rise to a poor estimate of the linear response function . 
 the first concerns the accessibility of the generalized fluctuation - dissipation relation due to the finite number of actual perturbations imposed to the control parameter . 
 the second concerns the propagation of the error made at the initial sampling of the external perturbation of the system . 
 this can be highly enhanced by introducing an estimator which corrects the error of the initial sampled condition . when these two effects are taken into account in the data analysis , the generalized fluctuation - dissipation relation is verified experimentally . "
"integrable systems play the role of prototypical examples to identify and understand the various phenomena underlying nonlinear dispersive systems such as korteweg - de vries , sine - gordon , heisenberg spin , nonlinear schrdinger , davey - stewartson , kadomtsev - petviashivili , etc
. equations [ ablowitz & clarkson , 1991 ; lakshmanan & rajasekar , 2003 ] .
nonintegrable perturbations can be analysed in terms of the basic excitations of such integrable models [ scott , 1999 ] .
these integrable systems are often shown to be linearizable in the sense that they can be associated with two linear differential equations ( of which one is a linear eigenvalue problem ) , namely the so called lax pairs . in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions , the exponentially localized stable entity ,
namely the soliton , turns out to be the basic structure exhibiting elastic collision property .
the soliton excitation has remarkable physical and mathematical properties .
in particular , the underlying nonlinear evolution equations exhibit infinite number of lie - bcklund symmetries [ bluman & kumei , 1989 ] .
the lie point symmetries lead to similarity reductions which are related to painlev type ordinary differential equations ( odes ) which are free from movable critical singular points .
more generally , the integrable soliton equations satisfy the painlev property and the solutions are in general free from movable critical singular manifolds .    in the case of nonlinear reaction diffusion equations ,
the dynamics is dominated by the onset of patterns [ murray , 1989 ; walgraef , 1996 ; lakshmanan & rajasekar , 2003 ] . out of all possible modes available to the system , they tend to select the most stable structures which give rise to various patterns .
these patterns range from simple to chaotic , depending on the nature of diffusion , nonlinear reaction terms and external forces as well as the spatial dimension . some of the dominant patterns are + ( 1 ) homogeneous or uniform states + ( 2 ) travelling waves + ( 3 ) wavefronts and pulses + ( 4 ) turing structures : a ) stripes b ) spirals c ) scrolls , etc .
+ ( 5 ) spatiotemporal chaos + and so on .
thus mode selection and stability dominates the study of such systems .
some of the well known nonlinear diffusion and reaction - diffusion systems[murray , 1989 ; walgraef , 1996 ; whitham , 1974 ] include burgers equation , fisher equation , kuromoto - sivashinsky equation , gierer - meinhardt equation , fitzhugh - nagumo equation , belousov - zhabotinsky reaction equation , brusselator model equation and so on .
a large amount of literature on such systems is available .    in view of the complexity involved in analysing nonlinear diffusion equations
, it will be very valuable to identify integrable nonlinear diffusive systems and to build on them the study of nonintegrable cases .
burgers equation is a standing example of such an integrable case [ sachdev , 1987 ] .
it is linearizable in the sense that the burgers equation @xmath1 under the cole - hopf transformation @xmath2 gets transformed into the linear heat equation @xmath3 similarly the fokas - yortsos - rosen equation [ fokas & yortsos ; 1982 & rosen , 1982 ] @xmath4 under the variable transformations [ rosen , 1982 ] @xmath5 gets again transformed into the linear heat equation eq .
( [ int3 ] ) .
thus both the above systems are linearizable and they may be considered to be c - integrable in the calogero [ 1991 ] sense .
also both the burgers equation and fokas - yortsos - rosen equation possess interesting lie point symmetry structures and infinite number of lie - bcklund symmetries .
so , it will be of interest to investigate whether other integrable and linearizable nonlinear reaction - diffusion equations exist and if so what is the role of symmetry therein and what kind of solution structures and patterns exist in them .    considering nonlinear reaction - diffusion equations ,
fisher equation is considered to be prototypical [ murray , 1989 ] .
typically , its form reads as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the laplacian operator . in one dimension
it admits travelling wavefronts with velocities @xmath8 , depending on the initial condition [ murray , 1989 ] and in two dimensions interesting spatiotemporal patterns arise ; however _ it is not integrable in any dimensions_. in one dimension , however it is known to have an exact propagating wavefront solution of the form [ ablowitz & zeppetella , 1979 ] @xmath9^{-2},\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath10 is an arbitrary constant , corresponding to the wave speed @xmath11 .
no other exact solutions are known for eq .
( [ int6 ] ) .
in this connection , it has been pointed out [ grimson & barker , 1994 ] that there arises interesting generalization of the fisher equation in the description of bacterial growth in multicolony environment , in chemical kinetics and in various living phenomena .
its general form is @xmath12 ^ 2+\lambda u({\bf r},t ) g(u ) , \label{gfe1}\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the diffusion coefficient , @xmath14 and @xmath7 are gradient and laplacian operators respectively . to be specific , eq .
( [ gfe1 ] ) represents the spatiotemporal growth of bacterial colonies with both local and nonlocal modes of growth . the third term on the right - hand side of eq .
( [ gfe1 ] ) represents the local growth characterised by the local growth rate @xmath15 and a local growth function @xmath16 .
suppose the colony is unable to add cells locally due to packing constraints , the nonlocal addition of cells on the surface of the colony occurs to account for the amount of growth required by the global growth law .
such an addition occurs as a consequence of the expansion and reorganization of the colony and is represented by the second term while the first term represents diffusion .
an important special case of eq .
( [ gfe1 ] ) is the generalized fisher type equation @xmath17 where the subscript denotes partial differentiation with respect to time . in the study of population dynamics
, @xmath18 refers to the population density at the point @xmath19 at time @xmath20 . in eq .
( [ gfe2 ] ) , the nondiffusive linear term modelling the birth rate gives rise to an exponential growth of @xmath18 in time while the quadratic term that models competition between individuals for food , etc .
leads to a stable , homogeneous value @xmath21 at long times and the diffusion term represents the spatial variation of the population .
further the third term represents the nonlocal growth of cells while the fourth term corresponds to the local growth .
this introduces the possibility of spatial pattern formation between the homogeneous regions with @xmath21 and @xmath22 for appropriate initial conditions .
note that for @xmath23 , eq .
( [ gfe2 ] ) reduces to the standard fisher equation ( [ int6 ] ) .
again eq .  ( [ gfe2 ] ) is in general nonintegrable , except for the special case @xmath0 .
it is linearizable under the transformation @xmath24 as pointed out by wang _
et al . _ [ 1996 ] for the one dimensional case ( see also brazhnik and tyson [ 1999a , b ] ) . under this transformation the generalized fisher equation ( [ gfe2 ] ) can be shown to reduce to the form @xmath25 which is nothing but the linear heat equation in arbitrary dimensions .
thus every solution of ( [ gfe4 ] ) corresponds to a solution of eq .
( [ gfe2 ] ) via the transformation ( [ gfe3 ] ) subject to boundary and initial conditions .
note that the transformation holds good irrespective of the spatial dimensionality of the generalized fisher system ( [ gfe2 ] ) as long as the parameter takes the value @xmath0 .
such a _ linearization in any dimensions is a rare situation _ indeed . even in soliton theory ,
straightforward extensions of integrable equations lose their integrability as soon as the dimension is increased .
in fact wang _
et al . _ [ 1996 ] and brazhnik and tyson [ 1999a , b ] make use of this linearizability property to obtain several interesting wave solutions , spatiotemporal patterns and static structures .
the very special nature of the @xmath0 case prompts us to investigate the integrability nature of the generalized fisher equation ( [ gfe2 ] ) from different points of view , particularly from singularity structure and symmetry points of view in order to understand why the case @xmath0 alone is integrable . for the nonintegrable case ( @xmath26 ) we investigate special solutions .    in sec .
[ sec3 ] , we show that the pde ( [ gfe2 ] ) in one dimension is free from movable critical singular manifolds only for the special case @xmath0 .
further we point out that a bcklund transformation gives rise to the linearizing transformation in a natural way for the integrable case . in sec .
[ s4 ] , we derive certain explicit and numerical solutions for the gf equation in one dimension via symmetry analysis and similarity reductions . in sec .
[ s5 ] , we present the associated lie algebra for the ( 2 + 1 ) dimensional gf equation
. then we report different types of propagating structures , static solutions and localized structures through lie symmetry analysis in secs .
[ s6 ] and [ s7 ] .
in addition , exact solutions for special cases of the nonintegrable gf equation are also given .
we give the nonclassical and generalized conditional reductions in secs .
[ s8 ] and [ s9 ] respectively .
finally , we summarise our results in sec .
it has been argued for sometime that the painlev property ( p - property ) as proposed by weiss _ et al . _ [ 1983 ] is a working test to identify whether a given nonlinear partial differential equation ( pde ) is integrable or not .
the painlev property demands that the solution of the given nonlinear pde is free from movable critical singular manifolds ( branching types , both algebraic and logarithmic as well as essential singular ) , so that the solution is single valued in the neighbourhood of a noncharacteristic movable singular manifold , @xmath27 , @xmath28 .
the weiss tabor carnevale ( wtc ) procedure then demands that the solution @xmath18 for eq .
( [ gfe2 ] ) can be expanded around the noncharacteristic movable singular manifold as a laurent expansion , @xmath29 where @xmath30 s are functions of @xmath19 and @xmath20 and @xmath31 is the leading order exponent of the laurent expansion .
for single valuedness of the solution , one requires that @xmath31 is an integer and that there exist sufficient number of arbitrary functions , @xmath32 ( for eq .
( [ gfe2 ] ) it is two ) , so that the laurent expansion ( [ pain1 ] ) can be considered as the general solution of the nonlinear pde ( [ gfe2 ] ) without the introduction of movable critical singular manifolds . following the standard algorithm we can proceed as follows . as an example , we demonstrate the analysis for the one - dimensional case , which can be then extended to the higher dimensional case without difficulty .      in the one - dimensional case
, the generalized fisher equation can be written as @xmath33 the wtc algorithm then identifies the following results . starting with the leading order behaviour @xmath34 as suggested by the form ( [ pain1 ] )
, one can identify three possibilities : @xmath35 one can easily check that for all the above three leading orders , only for the value @xmath0 , the solution is free from movable critical singular manifolds .
actually one finds that for @xmath0 and @xmath36 , the leading order coefficient @xmath37 is an arbitrary function in addition to the arbitrary nature of the singular manifold so that the laurent series contains the required number of arbitrary functions in terms of which all the other coefficient functions @xmath38 , can be uniquely found . for the other two leading orders with @xmath0 , one identifies only one arbitrary function but without the introduction of any movable critical singular manifolds and so they may be considered as corresponding to special solutions .
the above analysis also holds good in higher dimensions of ( [ gfe2 ] ) as well .
consequently one finds that the p - property is satisfied only for the special choice of parameter , @xmath0 for eq .
( [ gfe2 ] ) and for all other values of @xmath39 it fails to satisfy the p - property and the system is expected to be nonintegrable .
note however that there may exist certain special singular manifolds @xmath40 , for which the p - property may be satisfied in special situations .
however in general for the special choice of the parameter @xmath0 of eq .
( [ gfe2 ] ) the p - property is satisfied for general singular manifolds and the system is expected to be integrable in this case .
now we consider the laurent series ( [ pain1 ] ) applicable to eq .
( [ pain2 ] ) and truncate it at constant level term , by making all other coefficient functions @xmath41 to vanish for @xmath42 consistently : @xmath43 we demand that if @xmath44 is a solution of ( [ pain2 ] ) , so also @xmath45 is a solution . then , from eq .
( [ pain4 ] ) , we have @xmath46}^{-1}\big[u_{1x}^2\big .\nonumber & \\ \big .+2u_{0x}u_{1x}\phi^{-1 } + ( u_{0x}^2 - 2u_0u_{1x}\phi_x)\phi^{-2}-2u_0u_{0x}\phi_x \phi^{-3}+u_0 ^ 2\phi_x^2\phi^{-4}\big]&=0 . \label{pain5}\end{aligned}\ ] ]    consequently one finds that @xmath37 and @xmath47 satisfy a set of coupled pdes arising from eq .
( [ pain5 ] ) . starting from the trivial solution , @xmath48 , of eq .
( [ pain2 ] ) , we find that the choice @xmath49 solves eq .
( [ pain5 ] ) . as a result
, we find the new solution @xmath50 which is indeed a solution to eq .
( [ pain2 ] ) .    taking the solution ( [ pain7 ] ) as @xmath44 now , we find that the system ( [ pain5 ] ) satisfies the equations @xmath51 now defining the new function @xmath52 as @xmath53 one obtains the linear heat equation @xmath54 thus the transformation [ bindu _ et al .
_ , 2001 ; bindu & lakshmanan , 2002 ] @xmath55 is the _ linearizing transformation _ for eq .
( [ pain2 ] ) , where the function @xmath52 satisfies the linear heat equation ( [ pain9 ] ) .
we note that this is exactly the transformation given by wang _
et al . _ [ 1996 ] in an adhoc way . here
the transformation is given an interpretation in terms of the _ bcklund transformation_. thus the application of painlev singularity structure analysis selects not only the integrable case associated with eq .
( [ pain2 ] ) , but also helps to identify the associated linearizing transformation .    one can generalize the above analysis to higher dimensional case of the eq .
( [ gfe2 ] ) for the choice @xmath0 and arrive at the same general conclusion that the transformation ( [ pain10 ] ) can be interpreted as a bcklund transformation .
in this sec . , we investigate group invariance properties of the generalized fisher equation in its ( 1 + 1 ) dimensional form given in eq .
( [ pain2 ] ) and discuss different underlying patterns via similarity reductions .
first we consider the invariance of eq .
( [ pain2 ] ) under the one - parameter lie group of infinitesimal transformations and derive the similarity reduced odes for integrable ( @xmath0 ) and nonintegrable ( @xmath56 ) cases separately .
we solve the odes and provide explicit solutions .
we show that the earlier reported solutions are sub - cases of our results .
we construct the linearizing transformation from the infinitesimal symmetries and provide a group theoretical interpretation for it .
an invariance analysis of eq .
( [ pain2 ] ) under the one - parameter lie group of infinitesimal transformations    @xmath57    singles out a special value of @xmath58 , namely @xmath0 , to have nontrivial infinite - dimensional lie algebra of symmetries @xmath59 where @xmath60 are arbitrary constants and @xmath61 is any solution of the linear heat equation @xmath62 .
the infinitesimal symmetries ( [ ls2 ] ) are obtained by following the usual procedure of solving the determining equations for the infinitesimal symmetries [ bluman & kumei , 1989 ] . throughout this paper
we use the computer program mumath [ head , 1993 ] to determine infinitesimal symmetries and symmetry algebra .
the lie algebra of infinitesimal symmetries of the fisher equation is spanned by two commuting vector fields and a vector field associated with an infinite - dimensional subalgebra , @xmath63 respectively . in the above , the vector fields @xmath64 and
@xmath65 reflect the time and spatial invariance of eq .
( [ pain2 ] ) .
the commutation relations between these vector fields are given by @xmath66=0,\quad [ x_1,x_c]=x_{c_t},\quad   [ x_2,x_c]=x_{c_x } , \label{ls4}\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath67 and @xmath68 .
for all other values of the parameter @xmath39 , eq .
( [ pain2 ] ) admits only the trivial translational symmetries @xmath69 with the corresponding symmetry algebra @xmath66=0 , \label{ls6}\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath70 and @xmath71 .
we solve the characteristic equation associated with the symmetries ( [ ls2 ] ) and ( [ ls5 ] ) and obtain similarity variables in terms of which eq .
( [ pain2 ] ) can be reduced to an ode . from the general solution of the ode we construct explicit solutions for the gf equation ( [ pain2 ] ) .      solving the characteristic equation @xmath73 associated with the symmetries ( [ ls2 ] ) ,
we obtain the similarity reduced variables @xmath74 in eq .
( [ ls8 ] ) we can consider the quantity @xmath75 and verify that @xmath52 satisfies the linear heat equation ( [ pain9 ] ) .
then the _ similarity transformation _ given by eq .
( [ ls8 ] ) is the _ linearizing transformation _ thereby giving a group theoretical interpretation of it .    making use of ( [ ls8 ] ) , eq .
( [ pain2 ] ) reduces to an ode @xmath76 whose general solution can be written as @xmath77 here @xmath78 and @xmath79 are integration constants . now with the use of eq .
( [ ls8 ] ) , the solution to the original pde ( [ pain2 ] ) becomes @xmath80 with @xmath81,@xmath82 @xmath83 .
we note the following : by fixing the integration constants @xmath78 and @xmath79 suitably and for the choice @xmath84 we can deduce all the interesting travelling wave solutions and stationary structures discussed by brazhnik and tyson [ 1999a , b ] .
for example , let us consider @xmath85 . taking either one of the constants @xmath78 or @xmath79 equal to zero we have a simple travelling wave solution .
the choice @xmath86 leads to a v - wave pattern .
a y - wave solution is produced by @xmath87 .
an oscillating wave front is obtained by restricting @xmath88 with @xmath89 .
the choice @xmath90 leads to an inhomogeneous solution when @xmath91 .      a similar analysis on eq .
( [ ls5 ] ) for the @xmath93 case leads to the similarity variables @xmath94 which reduces the original pde ( [ pain2 ] ) to an ode of the form @xmath95 for @xmath96 , this equation is in general nonintegrable except for @xmath23 and @xmath97 .
this special choice leads to the cline solution @xmath98^{-2},\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath10 is an arbitrary constant reported by ablowitz and zeppetella [ 1979 ] ( fig .  1 ) and
the surface plot is shown in fig .  2 .
* case ( a ) : static solutions * @xmath99    this is the time - independent ( static ) case and the similarity variables @xmath100 lead to the reduced ode of the form @xmath101 this readily gives the first integral [ mathews & lakshmanan , 1974 ] @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the integration constant .
( [ ls17 ] ) on integration leads to elliptic or hyperelliptic function solutions for suitable values of @xmath58 .
for example , let us consider @xmath104 . then eq .
( [ ls17 ] ) becomes @xmath105v .
\label{ls18}\end{aligned}\ ] ] integration of eq .
( [ ls18 ] ) leads to @xmath106 where @xmath79 is the second integration constant .
let @xmath107 , @xmath82 @xmath108 . then eq .
( [ ls19 ] ) becomes @xmath109 now the lhs of the above equation can be integrated in terms of elliptic functions and the solutions are tabulated in table  1 . in a similar way one can integrate eq .
( [ ls17 ] ) and obtain elliptic and hyperelliptic function solutions for certain values of @xmath58 . besides the elliptic function solutions , for a particular value @xmath110 in eq .
( [ ls18 ] ) , we obtain a static solitary wave solution ( fig .
3 ) @xmath111 , \quad m < 1 .   \label{ls21}\end{aligned}\ ] ] eq .
( [ ls21 ] ) is nothing but a limiting case of the elliptic function solutions .
* case ( b ) : qualitative analysis *    in general eq .
( [ ls14 ] ) is of nonintegrable type and this leads to the use of numerical techniques to explore the underlying dynamics .
here we determine the equilibrium points and then study the system dynamics in the vicinity of these equilibrium points .
( [ ls14 ] ) , after a rescaling , can be written as @xmath112 where @xmath113 and @xmath114 .
then the equilibrium points are found to be @xmath115 and @xmath116 .
while the origin is an unstable equilibrium point , the stability determining eigenvalues for the equilibrium point ( 1,0 ) are found to be @xmath117 now the nature of the singular point @xmath116 is investigated as a function of the control parameter @xmath118 in the range @xmath119 by analysing the form of the eigenvalues @xmath120 given by eq .
( [ qa2 ] ) and the results are tabulated in table  2 and the corresponding plots are shown in fig .
one identifies the existence of periodic pulses and wave front solutions in this case .    .

generally , for many pdes there exist symmetry reductions that are not obtained by using the classical lie group method . as a consequence
, there have been several generalizations of the classical lie group method for symmetry reductions .
bluman and cole [ 1969 ] , then proposed the so - called _ non - classical method of group - invariant solutions _ in the study of symmetry reductions of a linear heat equation .
an algorithm for calculating the determining equations associated with the nonclassical method was presented by clarkson and mansfield [ 1993 ] .
this procedure has been applied to several nonlinear systems and in some cases , such as the boussinesq equation , the burgers equation and the fitzhugh - nagumo equation , new similarity reductions not obtainable through classical symmetries have been found [ levi & winternitz , 1989 ; arrigo _ et al .
_ 1993 ; nucci & clarkson , 1992 ] ( see also mansfield _ et al . _
[ 1998 ] and references therein ) . in the classical method we consider the infinitesimal generator , associated with the one - parameter lie group of transformations , @xmath122 which leaves the system ( [ pain2 ] ) invariant .
but in the nonclassical method , one requires the given equation ( [ pain2 ] ) and the surface condition @xmath123 together to be invariant under the transformation with the infinitesimal generator ( [ ncr1 ] ) . in this case one
may obtain a larger set of solutions than that for the classical method .
moreover , significant progress has been made in the study of nonclassical symmetries for nonlinear pdes of diffusive type .
to mention a few , gandarias and bruzn , [ 1999 ] have obtained several solutions for a family of cahn - hilliard equations that are not invariant under any lie group admitted by the equation . in a similar fashion ,
separable new solutions that are not obtainable via classical method have been reported for a mathematical model [ gandarias , 2001 ] of fast diffusion through nonclassical method .
this prompts us to look for nonclassical symmetries associated with the gf equation ( [ gfe2 ] ) .
there are two types of nonclassical symmetries : those where the infinitesimal @xmath124 is non - zero and those where it is zero . in the first case
, we can assume without loss of generality that @xmath125 , while in the second case we can assume @xmath126 and @xmath127 .
in the following we investigate them separately .
we set @xmath129 in the invariant surface condition without loss of generality and use it together with its differential consequences to eliminate @xmath130 and so eq .  ( [ pain2 ] ) takes the form @xmath131 applying the classical lie algorithm to ( [ ncr3 ] ) and eliminating the highest derivative involving the variable @xmath132 , the coefficients of the linearly independent expressions in the remaining derivatives are set equal to zero . from the resultant set of determining equations for @xmath133 and @xmath134 , which are in general nonlinear , we get    @xmath135    [ ncr4 ]    where @xmath136 is an arbitrary constant . in eq .
( [ ncr4a ] ) , @xmath137 satisfies @xmath138 .
the corresponding similarity variables for the @xmath139 case are @xmath140 which are similar to the ones obtained by the classical method earlier in sec.[s4 ] .
thus we are lead to the similarity reduced differential equation @xmath141 which is similar to ( [ ls10 ] ) and the results then follows as before .
similar is the case with @xmath26 .
thus both _ classical and nonclassical reductions lead to the same solutions _ for the present system .
let @xmath143 and @xmath144 .
we then set @xmath145 , without loss of generality .
the invariance surface condition simplifies the fisher equation to @xmath146 applying the classical lie algorithm to the above equation we end up with a more complicated nonlinear pde @xmath147 this system is considerably more complex than the system ( [ pain2 ] ) and hence can not be solved in general .
we have made different anstze for @xmath148 and found that all of them lead to only the group invariant solutions found by the classical algorithm .
however , for the @xmath23 case , by assuming @xmath47 to be independent of @xmath149 and @xmath20 we get @xmath150 which is different from that obtained through the classical method .
however this choice leads to a singular solution of the form @xmath151      we extend the nonclassical symmetry analysis to the ( 2 + 1 ) dimensional fisher equation ( [ gf1 ] ) and in this analysis there are three cases to consider , namely , ( i ) @xmath152 , ( ii ) @xmath153 , and ( iii ) @xmath154 .
we use the invariance surface condition @xmath156 with its differential consequences to eliminate @xmath157 . applying the classical lie algorithm to the fisher equation @xmath158 and then equating coefficients of various powers of derivatives of the dependent variable @xmath159 we have a set of determining equations . solving them we get finally    [ ncr11 ] @xmath160    here @xmath161 satisfies the equation @xmath162 and @xmath163 are arbitrary constants . comparing this set of symmetries with that obtained by the classical method
we find that they are similar to the latter case .
so the similarity reductions will reduce the pde to the same ode as that obtained by the classical method .      here
we set @xmath166 , without loss of generality , and analogous to the above procedure we use the above choice to eliminate all @xmath167-derivatives . then applying the classical lie algorithm to the resulting equation we obtain a more complicated nonlinear pde . solving the resultant system of determining equations
we obtain the following symmetries    [ ncr13 ] @xmath168    for all values of @xmath58 .
the similarity reduction variables @xmath169 associated with ( [ ncr13a ] ) reduces the gf equation in 2-spatial dimensions to that in 1-spatial dimension .
similarly , the similarity transformations @xmath170 for ( [ ncr13b ] ) again reduces the original pde to that in 1-dimension and hence the results follow as in the case of the classical method .      in this case
we set @xmath174 , without loss of generality , and as above we make use of the invariance condition @xmath175 to eliminate all @xmath132-derivatives .
then we apply the classical lie algorithm to the resulting equation and we get a nonlinear pde of the form @xmath176&=0 . \label{ncr14}\end{aligned}\ ] ] solving the system of determining equations we obtain @xmath177 @xmath178 . thus the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional gf type equation , under the similarity transformation @xmath179 reduces to that in ( 1 + 1)-dimensions and hence the results as in the case of the classical lie algorithm case follow .
recently fokas and liu [ 1994a , b ] proposed the notion of generalized conditional symmetry ( gcs ) and applied it to construct some physically interesting exact solutions of certain nonlinear nonintegrable pdes .
such exact solutions are of primary importance because they identify certain interesting and novel physical phenomena and moreover such solutions may be hard to identify or may not be quite transparent from the numerical solution of a nonlinear pde . in this method
the pde is reduced to an ode in terms of certain types of generalized conditional symmetries .
indeed the gcs can be considered as a natural generalization of the nonclassical method just as the generalized symmetry method [ olver , 1986 ] is considered as a generalization of the lie - point symmetry method .
particularly , for the reaction diffusion type equations , several new separable solutions that can not be obtained via the non - classical and non - local symmetry methods have been derived through this method [ qu , 1997 ; qu , 1999a , b ; chou & ku , 1999 ; qu _ et al . _ , 2000 ] . further , it is recently shown that the gcs method is the most efficient tool for solving the problem of dimensional reduction of initial value problems for evolutionary type pdes in a purely algebraic way [ zhadanov & andreitsev , 2000 ] .
motivated by these facts we investigate the existence of generalized conditional symmetries , if any , for the gf equation .
let @xmath180 denotes a function that depends on a differentiable manner of @xmath181 .
the function @xmath182 is a generalized symmetry of the evolution equation @xmath183 iff @xmath184=0 ,   \label{gcs1}\end{aligned}\ ] ] when @xmath185 , where @xmath186 = \sigma'k - k'\sigma , $ ] and the prime denotes the gateaux derivative .
the function @xmath187 is a gcs of equation ( [ pain2 ] ) if there exists a function @xmath188 such that @xmath189=a(t , x , u,\sigma ) , \quad a(t , x , u,0)=0 ,   \label{gcs2}\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath190 , and @xmath187 are differentiable functions of @xmath191 and @xmath192 is a differentiable function of @xmath193 , ... , and @xmath194 it is obvious from ( [ gcs2 ] ) that eq .
( [ gcs1 ] ) admits a gcs @xmath195 iff @xmath196 provided @xmath195 is explicitly independent of time @xmath197 .
let the fisher equation admits a gcs of the form @xmath198 where @xmath199 and @xmath16 are arbitrary functions @xmath45 .
substituting ( [ gcs4 ] ) into ( [ gcs3 ] ) one gets @xmath200 u_x^4\nonumber\\ + \bigg[f_{uu}-2hf_u-4f(h_u - h^2)+\frac{m } { 1-u}(f_u+4fh)+   \frac{4mf}{(1-u)^2}\bigg]u_x^3    \nonumber\\   -\bigg[g_{uu}-2f(f_u - hf ) -4g(h_u - h^2)+(2u-1)h - u(1-u)h_u\bigg.\nonumber\\\bigg.+\frac{m}{1-u}\left(4hg-2f^2+g_u\right )   + \frac{5mg}{(1-u)^2}\bigg]u_x^2- \bigg [ \left(u(1-u)+2g\right)f_u   \bigg.\nonumber \\\bigg.+4fg\left(\frac{m}{1-u}-h\right)\bigg]u_x   - u(1-u)g_u + ( 1 - 2u)g \nonumber\\+2g^2(h-\frac{m}{1-u})&=0 .
\label{gcs5}\end{aligned}\ ] ] equating coefficients of various powers of @xmath201 to zero and then solving the resulting overdetermined equations we get @xmath202 where @xmath203 and @xmath204 are arbitrary constants .
the corresponding gcs are @xmath205 with the above some exact solutions can be constructed .
the ode @xmath206 is solved to obtain @xmath159 as a function of @xmath149 with integration constants dependent on time @xmath20 alone . then substituting this solution into the governing equation , the time evolution of these time - independent constants are determined .
the exact solutions are then obtained by solving these systems .
the gcs ( [ gcs7 ] ) leads to @xmath207 which can not be integrated as such except for @xmath0 .
thus for @xmath0 , we obtain @xmath208^{-1},\quad   m_{1,2}=\frac{-c_1\pm\sqrt{c_1 ^ 2 - 4}}{2}. \label{gcs9}\end{aligned}\ ] ] substituting ( [ gcs9 ] ) into the fisher equation ( [ pain2 ] ) we get    [ gcs10 ] @xmath209}+be^{\displaystyle[(m_2 ^ 2 + 1)t+m_2x]}\right)^{-1 } } , \label{gcs10a } \\&\displaystyle{m_{1,2}=\frac { c_1 \pm \sqrt{c_1 ^ 2 - 4c_2 } } { 2 } } , & \label{gcs10b}\end{aligned}\ ] ]    for @xmath0 .
we wish to mention that the solution ( [ gcs10a ] ) can be recovered from the linear heat equation wang _ et al . _
[ 1996 ] and the results are similar to that obtained through the classical algorithm . further eq .
( [ gcs10b ] ) is similar to eq .
( [ ls12 ] ) and hence we obtain the various propagating structures already discussed through the classical method .
( [ gcs8 ] ) is of non - painlev type for all other values of m ( @xmath210 ) and is similar to ( [ ls14 ] ) and hence the previous results follow .
thus gcs reductions lead to the same results as that obtained through the classical method for the modified perturbed gf equation .
in this paper , we have investigated the integrability / symmetry properties of the generalized fisher type nonlinear reaction - diffusion equation in both ( 1 + 1 ) and ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions .
the singularity structure analysis singles out the @xmath0 case as the only system parameter for which the gf equation is free from movable critical singular manifolds .
further a bcklund transformation for the integrable case is shown to linearize the gf equation to the linear heat equation .
the symmetry analysis shows that the system under consideration possesses interesting lie point symmetries that lead to the infinite - dimensional lie algebra for the integrable case , thereby exhibiting various interesting patterns and dynamics , and giving rise to a group theoretical interpretation for the system .
in addition to the above , we have given exact and numerical solutions for specific choices of the nonintegrable case . our studies on the gf equation reveals the existence of a large number of interesting wave patterns , static and localized structures .
we have also carried out the nonclassical and generalized conditional symmetry reductions .

a _ , * 164 * , 56 - 59 ." ," the dynamics of nonlinear reaction - diffusion systems is dominated by the onset of patterns and fisher equation is considered to be a prototype of such diffusive equations . here 
 we investigate the integrability properties of a generalized fisher equation in both ( 1 + 1 ) and ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions . 
 a painlev singularity structure analysis singles out a special case ( @xmath0 ) as integrable . 
 more interestingly , a bcklund transformation is shown to give rise to a linearizing transformation for the integrable case . 
 a lie symmetry analysis again separates out the same @xmath0 case as the integrable one and hence we report several physically interesting solutions via similarity reductions . 
 thus we give a group theoretical interpretation for the system under study . 
 explicit and numerical solutions for specific cases of nonintegrable systems are also given . 
 in particular , the system is found to exhibit different types of travelling wave solutions and patterns , static structures and localized structures . besides the lie symmetry analysis , 
 nonclassical and generalized conditional symmetry analysis are also carried out . "
"the study of the stellar population in galaxies presents some unique challenges .
first , the method used to characterize a stellar population is crucial as it provides constraints on theories of galaxy formation ( e.g. de lucia et al .
second , age and metallicity dominated indicators should minimize the age - metallicity degeneracy described in the 3/2 worthey law ( worthey , trager & faber 1995 ) .
finally , a galaxy s environment may be the dominant influence on its star formation history , further reducing the adequacy of the single stellar population ( ssp ) assumption .
monolithic collapse models predict early - type systems with a central region that is more metal rich , slightly younger , and less @xmath16 enhanced than the outer parts .
mergers may wash out any possible gradient present in the progenitors , although dissipation can trigger star formation in the cores of galaxies , creating age gradients .
it is important to emphasize that we still lack firm quantitative estimates for many of these effects  @xcite .
considering the impact of such predictions , we need large and well characterized samples to tackle this issue . the nearby universe ( @xmath17 ) provides a starting point , as we now have high quality data for large numbers of galaxies .
the study of color gradients is motivated by the possibility of discriminating between different models of galaxy formation , and points to the real need for systematic and accurate measurements for a large and well controlled sample of etgs .
these systems become gradually bluer in the outskirts ( e.g. peletier et al . 1990 ; goudfrooij et al .
1994 ; michard 1999 ; wu et al .
2005 ; cantiello et al . 2005 ; suh et al .
although the age - metallicity degeneracy makes the interpretation of the color gradient troublesome , metallicity gradient seems to be main cause ( e.g. saglia et al . 2000 ; @xcite ; la barbera et al .
small , positive age gradients are also consistent with observations ( e.g.  @xcite ) , and have been detected in the low - redshift population of etgs  @xcite .
positive color gradients in high - redshift etgs have been observed by  @xcite , who found that about one - third of field etgs at @xmath18 have blue cores , in contrast to only @xmath19 at lower redshift ( see also  @xcite ) .
the possibility that color gradients could be due merely to dust in a well mixed stellar population has been considered ( e.g. goudfrooij & de jong 1995 ) but many etgs exhibit radial gradients of metal absorption features , which can not be attributed to dust ( e.g. gonzalez  1993 ; mehlert et al . 2000 ) .
furthermore , many etgs are undetected by iras at 60 @xmath20 and 100 @xmath20 .
cosmological simulations do not yet have sufficient spatial resolution to provide reliable color gradients .
however , chemo - dynamical simulations of etgs are starting to yield meaningful results for metallicity gradients , reproducing some observed population gradients ( see kobayashi 2004 ) .
the last decade has witnessed the appearance of important observational studies using photometric and spectroscopic data to constrain age , metallicity and elemental abundances (  @xcite ) .
they conclude that age and metallicity are anti - correlated for galaxies of a given luminosity .
furthermore , poggianti et al .
( 2001b ) find that in high density regimes a large fraction of systems shows no signs of star formation in their centers .
another important finding relating star formation and environment comes from the work of  @xcite who analyzed a sample of early - type systems in the low density regime ( field ) showing that these galaxies are younger and more metal - rich than their counterparts in clusters .
most of these studies used samples of at most a few hundred galaxies .
since these works are the nearby counterparts of the studies of the evolution of early - type galaxies ( etgs ) as a function of redshift in clusters ( e.g.  @xcite ) and in low - density environments  @xcite , it is necessary to establish large and well - defined samples covering a broad range of environments as we do here .
this is the fourth paper of a series studying the global properties of etgs in the local universe ( @xmath17 ) .
we focus on stellar population gradients and how they depend on galaxy properties .
we use optical data ( @xmath21 photometry and spectra ) from the sloan digital sky survey data release 6 ( sdss , * ? ? ?
* ) and near - infrared photometry from the ukirt infrared deep sky survey data release four ( ukidss , * ? ? ?
the selection of etgs is described in la barbera et al .
( 2010a ; hereafter paper i ) , and we refer the reader to that paper for all the details on sample selection and the procedures used to derive the galaxy parameters .
the results presented in this paper apply not only to ellipticals , but also to lenticular galaxies as well as those dominated by a red central bulge ( but see sec .

10 we summarize our most important results . throughout the paper ,
we adopt a cosmology with @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 .
the sample of etgs is selected from sdss - dr6 , following the procedure described in la barbera et al .
( 2008b ) , la barbera & de carvalho ( 2009 ) , and paper i. we select galaxies in the redshift range of 0.05 to 0.095 , with @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the k - corrected sdss petrosian magnitude in r - band .
the k - correction is determined using the software @xmath27 ( version @xmath28 ;  @xcite ) , through a restframe r - band filter blue - shifted by a factor @xmath29 .
we adopt @xmath30 as in ( e.g. )  @xcite .
the lower redshift limit of the sample is chosen to minimize the aperture bias  @xcite , while the upper redshift limit guarantees not only a high level of completeness ( according to  @xcite ) , but also allows us to define a volume - limited sample of _ bright _ early - type systems . at the upper redshift limit of @xmath31 ,
the magnitude cut of @xmath32 also corresponds approximately to the magnitude limit to which the sdss spectroscopy is complete ( i.e. a petrosian magnitude of @xmath33 ) .
following  @xcite , we define etgs using the sdss spectroscopic parameter @xmath34 , which indicates the spectral type of a galaxy on the basis of a principal component analysis , and the sdss photometric parameter @xmath35 , which measures the fraction of the galaxy light that is better fitted by a de vaucouleurs ( rather than an exponential ) law
. etgs are those systems with @xmath36 and @xmath37 .
we select only galaxies with central velocity dispersion , @xmath38 , available from sdss - dr6 , in the range of @xmath39 and @xmath40 kms@xmath41 , and with no spectroscopic warning on ( i.e. @xmath42 attribute set to zero ) .
these constraints are chosen to select only reliable velocity dispersion measurements from sdss . applying the above criteria leads to a sample of @xmath43 etgs .    out of the @xmath43 etgs defining the spider sample
, @xmath44 also have photometry in the @xmath45 wavebands from the ukidss - large area survey ( see  paper i ) .
all galaxies have two measures of the central velocity dispersion , one from sdss - dr6 and an alternate estimate obtained by fitting sdss spectra with the starlight software  @xcite . in all wavebands , the structural parameters including effective radius , @xmath46 , the mean surface brightness within that radius , @xmath47 , and the sersic index , @xmath48 , have been homogeneously measured using 2dphot  @xcite .
total magnitudes are computed from the effective parameters in each filter .    for this work ,
we select etgs from the spider survey as follows .
first , we exclude galaxies which are poorly fitted by a two - dimensional sersic model .
this is done by selecting only objects with @xmath49 in all wavebands , where @xmath50 is the rms of residuals between the galaxy image in a given band and the corresponding best - fitting two - dimensional sersic model .
the threshold @xmath51 excludes those objects which are more than 5  @xmath12 above the peak of the @xmath50 distribution in all passbands .
as shown in  paper i , the distributions of @xmath50 in @xmath52 are peaked around one , with a width of @xmath53 .
second , since we estimate the internal color gradients from @xmath46 and @xmath48 , we exclude galaxies with large uncertainties on these parameters .
as shown in  paper i , the errors on @xmath48 are nearly independent of @xmath54 ratio , and are always less than @xmath53  dex . on the other hand , the errors on @xmath46 strongly depend on the @xmath54 .
to remove galaxies with large uncertainties without overly reducing the sample size , we select only those etgs with a @xmath55 uncertainty less than @xmath56  dex in all wavebands .
these restrictions yield a subsample of @xmath57 galaxies with parameters in @xmath21 . of these
, @xmath58 objects also have photometry in @xmath45 .
hereafter , we refer to these as the optical and optical+nir samples of etgs , respectively .
we analyze the dependence of internal color gradients in etgs on galaxy parameters , i.e. structural parameters , optical and nir magnitudes , stellar and dynamical masses , and stellar population properties ( age , metallicity , and @xmath10-enhancement ) . the derivation of magnitudes and structural parameters is described in  paper i. below ,
we describe the estimate of stellar and dynamical masses ( sec .
[ sec : stellar_masses ] and  [ sec : dyn_masses ] ) , as well as that of the stellar population parameters ( sec .
[ sec : stellar_pop ] ) .
galaxy stellar masses can be estimated by fitting their observed seds with stellar population synthesis models .
@xcite demonstrated that such techniques , combining optical and near - ir fluxes with spectroscopic redshifts , could be used to derive masses with a factor of two uncertainty to @xmath59 .
local studies by @xcite and @xcite examined the stellar mass function using similar methods . @xcite
have shown that galaxy properties derived from sed fitting with broadband colors are consistent with those derived from spectroscopic data .
thus , we use sed fitting to derive galaxy stellar masses .
we employ the lephare code ( s. arnouts & o. ilbert ) used by the cosmos survey @xcite to fit a suite of ( * ? ? ?
* hereafter bc03 ) model seds to our observed 8-band photometry and the known spectroscopic redshift .
lephare performs a @xmath50 minimization between the observed fluxes ( and their associated errors ) and those synthesized from the models .
because early - types are unlikely to have significant ongoing star formation , we use a simple set of @xcite seds , with 6 different star - formation e - folding times @xmath60 , 5 internal reddenings @xmath61 , and four metallicities @xmath62 , for a total of 120 possible models .
the values of these parameters are given in tab .
[ tab : sedmods ] .
we assume a @xcite extinction law and @xcite initial mass function .
the reddening e(b - v ) is limited to 0.5 magnitudes to avoid incorrect fitting of observationally red galaxies as highly reddened blue galaxies ; such objects should be absent from our sample .
because each bc03 template is normalized to one solar mass , we use the observed @xmath63-band flux to determine the normalization of the best - fit template which then gives the stellar mass .
we use @xmath63-band for the mass scaling since it is only weakly affected by dust extinction and is quite insensitive to the presence of young , luminous stars @xcite .
c|c|c 1 & 0 & 0.2 + 2 & 0.1 & 0.4 + 3 & 0.2 & 1.0 + 5 & 0.3 & 3.0 + 10 & 0.4 & + 15 & 0.5 & + [ tab : sedmods ]    galaxy fluxes are estimated in an adaptive aperture of radius @xmath64 in all wavebands , where @xmath65 is the i - band kron radius ( see  paper i ) .
we use these aperture fluxes as they have a better accuracy than those obtained from ( 2dphot ) total magnitudes . in order to derive total stellar masses , @xmath66
, we apply an aperture correction .
we calculate the fraction of total to @xmath67 aperture flux in k - band , and then multiply the estimated stellar mass by this fraction .
this procedure assumes that stellar mass in a galaxy is distributed in the same way as the k - band light .
rather than use an individual best - fitting sed ( based on the @xmath68 ) , we use a mass computed from the model corresponding to the median @xmath69 .
this reduces stochastic mass errors due to individual models which happen to have very low @xmath68 values , since there remains some degeneracy in the sed fits even with 8 filters .
a small number of galaxies ( 1465 of 39993 with optical data only , and 286 of 4546 with nir data ) are not well fit by any of the seds , resulting in @xmath70 and thus no stellar mass estimate .
these objects , comprising 3.6% and 6.3% of the optical and optical+nir samples , respectively , are excluded from analyzes that require the stellar masses .
we tested our stellar masses by comparing to those derived by a group at max plank using sdss photometry alone .
the overall agreement is excellent .
we find a modest offset in @xmath71 of 0.14 dex ; this is because we use kron magnitudes rather than fiber magnitudes ; kron magnitudes are @xmath72 mag brighter , which translates into a difference @xmath73 in @xmath74 .
the @xmath75 scatter between the two mass estimators is only 0.1 dex , a factor of @xmath76 smaller than most systematic errors and biases introduced by different choices of imf , extinction law , etc .
more details of the sed fitting and potential sources of errors and biases in the stellar mass estimates will be presented in an upcoming paper in this series devoted to this issue alone  ( swindle et al .
2010 , in preparation ) .
we note that both the sed fitting and the analysis of color gradients ( sec .
[ sec : grads ] ) are performed with a different set of models ( i.e. bc03 ) than that used for the spectral analysis ( i.e. miles , see sec .  [
sec : stellar_pop ] ) .
the bc03 models provide a high resolution of 1  @xmath77 in the wavelength range 3322  @xmath77 to 9300  @xmath77 ( griz ) , with a median resolution of 10  @xmath77 in zyjhk .
we do not use the miles library here as we do for other tests in this paper due to its limited wavelength coverage ( 3525  @xmath77 to 7500  @xmath77 ) . with 7500  @xmath77 lying near the central wavelength of the i - band , ignoring the izyjhk data inevitably yields failures in sed identification ,
provided the range of model parameters given in tab .  1 .
this uncertainty , coupled with the benefit of the k - band flux for mass - scaling , motivates this choice of models for the sed fitting . the technical justification for using the miles library in analyzing spectra and color gradients
is also detailed in sec .
[ sec : stellar_pop ] .
dynamical masses , @xmath3 , are obtained from galaxy effective radii and velocity dispersions . applying the virial theorem , we write @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the effective radius in k - band , and @xmath80 is a scale factor that accounts for the internal structure of etgs .
most previous works estimated @xmath80 by assuming a single universal model for the light distribution in etgs , such as the king model  @xcite .
however , this does not account for the variety of etg light profile shapes ( e.g. * ? ? ?
* ) , as parametrized by the sersic index . to account for this , following a similar procedure to that of  @xcite
, we estimate @xmath80 using de - projected sersic galaxy models .
the models and the de - projection procedure are detailed in  @xcite .
the models describe spherical , non - rotating , isotropic galactic systems .
we also assume that the spatial distribution of dark matter follows that of the stellar component . under these assumptions ,
each model consists of a single sersic component characterized by three parameters : the half - mass radius , the total mass , and the sersic index ( see  @xcite for details ) .
the use of more complex models ( i.e. those with two - components ) is well beyond the scope of this paper , and we postpone it to a forthcoming contribution . for each etg
, we construct the corresponding sersic model , using the effective radius and sersic index of the galaxy in k - band .
we estimate @xmath80 by computing the ratio of the quantities @xmath3 and @xmath81 for the given model .
we compute @xmath38 by projecting the model in two - dimensions , within a circular aperture of radius @xmath82 , i.e. the same aperture as the sdss fibers .
since we do not have k - band structural parameters for the optical sample of etgs , @xmath3 is only estimated for galaxies in the optical+nir sample .
[ fig : mpetr_mdyn ] shows the dynamical masses versus the petrosian magnitudes , from which we see that our limiting magnitude corresponds to a lower mass limit of @xmath83 .
as described in paper i , we have re - measured velocity dispersions for etgs in the spider sample using starlight  @xcite .
this software determines the linear combination of simple stellar population ( ssp ) models which , broadened with a given @xmath12 , best matches the observed galaxy spectrum .
hereafter , we refer to the set of ssp models provided as input to starlight as the ssp _ basis _ , and to the output linear combination of ssps as the synthetic spectrum . for the purpose of remeasuring the @xmath38 s , we run starlight with a _ basis _ of ssps from the miles galaxy spectral library ( vazdekis et al .
2010 ) , covering a wide range of ages and metallicities , but with fixed solar abundance ratio ( [ @xmath10/fe]=0 ) .
here we also use starlight to estimate the @xmath15 , @xmath84 $ ] , and @xmath8 $ ] of each etg .
in contrast to the more common practice of using index - index diagrams to estimate ssp - equivalent stellar population parameters  , starlight uses all of the information present in the data , by fitting a set of ssp models to the entire galaxy spectrum .
a detailed comparison of stellar population parameter estimates from different techniques for the spider sample is currently under way , and will be the subject of a forthcoming paper in this series . here , we provide only the essential information on how we use starlight to derive @xmath15 , @xmath84 $ ] , and @xmath8 $ ] . for each galaxy , we run starlight using the alpha - enhanced miles ( hereafter @xmath10-miles ) spectral library  ( cervantes et .
al .  2007 ) .
as detailed in app .
[ app : miles ] , the @xmath10-miles library extends the miles galaxy spectral library to ssp models with non - solar abundance ratios , in the @xmath8 $ ] range of @xmath85 to @xmath86 , allowing the spectra of etgs to be modeled with better accuracy than that achieved with solar - abundance miles models .
the @xmath10-miles seds cover the same spectral range ( @xmath87  ) , with the same spectral resolution ( 2.3  ) , as the ( solar abundance ) miles library .
hence , they are well suited to analyzing sdss spectra , whose spectral resolution is @xmath11 2.36    fwhm , in the wavelength interval 4800 - 5350   . to run starlight , we select a _ basis _ of @xmath88 @xmath10-miles ssps , with ages ranging from @xmath89 to @xmath90
gyr in eleven steps , metallicities of @xmath84=-0.68 ,    -0.38 ,    0 . ,     0.2 $ ] , and enhancements of @xmath8=+0.0 , + 0.20 , + 0.40 , + 0.60 $ ] .
this grid in @xmath15 , @xmath84 $ ] , and @xmath8 $ ] allows us to cover a wide range of stellar population properties without overly increasing the execution time required to run starlight   ( out of @xmath43 spider ) etgs , we found that all ssp models in the _ basis _ , but those with @xmath8=+0.0 $ ] , received zero - weight in the starlight synthetic spectra .
for these objects , we enlarged the _ basis _ by including also @xmath10-miles ssps with @xmath8=-0.20 $ ] , and re - ran starlight accordingly . ] .
for each galaxy , we first smooth the _ basis _ models to match the wavelength - dependent resolution of the sdss spectrum ( see paper i for details ) .
starlight outputs the light percentage , @xmath91 , of each ssp _ basis _ model in the output synthetic spectrum . hence , for a given property @xmath92 ( e.g. @xmath15 )
, one can estimate its _ luminosity - weighted _ value , @xmath93 , as @xmath94 where the summation is performed over all the ssp _ basis _ models .
the @xmath15 is obtained directly from eq .
[ eq : lum_weight_sp ] .
since metallicity and enhancement are logarithmic quantities , we first apply eq .
[ eq : lum_weight_sp ] by setting @xmath95}$ ] and @xmath96}$ ] , and then compute the logarithm of @xmath93 in both cases .
the uncertainties on @xmath15 , @xmath84 $ ] , and @xmath8 $ ] are computed by comparing the estimates of these quantities for @xmath97 galaxies with repeated observations in sdss , following the same procedure described in paper i to obtain the errors on @xmath38 .
the average uncertainties are @xmath98 on @xmath15 , and @xmath99 for @xmath84 $ ] and @xmath8 $ ] .
an important potential bias when using the spectra from sdss is the effect of a fixed spectroscopic fiber aperture on the @xmath15 , @xmath84 $ ] , and @xmath8 $ ] estimates .
the fraction of galaxy light inside the fiber will vary with galaxy size and redshift . because we select the spider sample based on the @xmath34 parameter ,
the galaxies are selected to have passive spectra in their centers .
this means that , as discussed in paper i , our putative early - type sample could be contaminated by early spiral systems , i.e. spiral galaxies with a prominent bulge component .
indeed , in paper i we show that this contamination is about 15% , falling to  5% for a higher quality sample defined on the basis of visual image classification . as we discuss at the end of sec .
8.3 ( fig .
16 ) , the trends with stellar population properties remain unchanged when restricting the spider sample to the lower contamination subsample .
the converse might also hold , i.e. we might be missing etgs with strong emission features localized to their cores . however , very few etgs are expected to have spectra exhibiting such strong central emission .    in fig .
[ figfrac ] we display how @xmath15 , @xmath84 $ ] , and @xmath8 $ ] vary with the fraction of light inside the fiber _ wrt _ the total light , l(r@xmath100)/l@xmath101 , along with the distribution of this fraction , showing that @xmath1165% of the galaxies have a ratio between @xmath102 and @xmath103 .
the median trends , negligible compared to the scatter in @xmath15 , @xmath84 $ ] , and @xmath8 $ ] , show that the derived stellar population parameters are not affected by the aperture effect , reinforcing what we have presented in app .
[ sec : apcor ] , i.e. that the average @xmath104 does not change much _ wrt _ the stellar population parameters , implying that the correlation of color gradients with stellar population properties has no dependence on @xmath104 .
the values of @xmath15 , @xmath84 $ ] , and @xmath8 $ ] used here are _ not _ ssp - equivalent parameters , as commonly used in the literature , but are luminosity - weighted quantities inferred from the galaxy spectra .
as mentioned above , a detailed comparison of ssp - equivalent and luminosity - weighted parameters will be performed in a forthcoming contribution .
internal color gradients are estimated using the same approach as  ( * ? ? ? * hereafter ldc09 ) , using the two - dimensional fits to the @xmath52 galaxy images with seeing - convolved sersic models ( paper i ) .
color gradients are defined as the logarithmic slope of the galaxy radial color profile , @xmath105 , where @xmath91 and @xmath106 are any two wavebands , and @xmath107 is the distance to the galaxy center . from @xmath52 data we can measure seven independent color gradients . as in ldc09 ,
we calculate the color gradients between the @xmath108 band and all other wavebands , in the form of @xmath109 . for each galaxy and for each band , we estimate the mean surface brightness of the de - convolved sersic model on a set of concentric ellipses , whose ellipticities and position angles are fixed to those from the @xmath110-band sersic fit .
the ellipses are equally spaced in equivalent radius @xmath107 by @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is the the r - band effective radius .
the color index @xmath113 at a given radius @xmath107 is obtained by subtracting the mean surface brightnesses at the corresponding ellipse .
each color profile is fitted in the radial range of @xmath114 to @xmath115 ( see e.g.  @xcite ) using an orthogonal least squares fitting procedure .
the slope of the best - fitting profile gives the gradient @xmath109 .
for the optical sample of etgs , only the @xmath116 , @xmath117 , and @xmath118 color gradients are estimated . as discussed in ldc09 , small changes in the radial range used in this computation
do not significantly change the color gradient estimates .    to estimate the uncertainties on @xmath109 we repeated the above procedure by shifting @xmath46 and @xmath48 in each band according to their measurement errors , taking into account the corresponding covariance term ( paper i ) .
we repeat this using @xmath119 shifts , and the errors on @xmath109 are then obtained from the widths of the distributions of @xmath109 .
fig .  [ cgrad_hist ] plots the distributions of @xmath113 color gradients for both the optical and optical+nir samples of etgs . for each distribution , we compute the corresponding peak and width ( @xmath20 and @xmath12 ) using bi - weight statistics  @xcite .
the values of @xmath20 and @xmath12 , with the corresponding bootstrap uncertainties , are reported in fig .
[ cgrad_hist ] , as well as in tabs .
[ tab : stat_cgrad_optnir ] and  [ tab : stat_cgrad_opt ] for the optical+nir and the optical samples of etgs , respectively .
all the distributions are sharply peaked .
the peak value of @xmath109 smoothly decreases from about @xmath120 in @xmath121 to @xmath122 in @xmath123 , i.e. the typical color gradient of etgs becomes increasingly negative as we enlarge the wavelength baseline over which it is computed .
it is remarkable that the peak values of @xmath116 , @xmath117 , and @xmath118 , as well as the corresponding widths , are consistent between the optical ( i.e. tab .
[ tab : stat_cgrad_opt ] ) and optical+nir ( i.e. tab .
[ tab : stat_cgrad_optnir ] ) samples of etgs .
[ cgrad_hist ] also shows that the distribution of @xmath121 through @xmath124 color gradients is consistent between the optical ( solid curve in the figure ) and the optical+nir samples .
the width of the @xmath109 distributions smoothly increases from @xmath121 through @xmath123 .
this trend might be due to larger errors on the near - infrared structural parameters than on the optical ones ( paper i ) , implying that the typical uncertainty on color gradients is larger for the optical 
nir rather than optical  optical @xmath109 . tabs .
[ tab : stat_cgrad_optnir ] and  [ tab : stat_cgrad_opt ] provide the median uncertainties on the color gradients , @xmath125 , obtained by propagating the errors on structural parameters ( sec .
[ sec : cg_estimates ] ) .
we estimate the intrinsic width of the @xmath109 distributions , @xmath126 , by subtracting in quadrature @xmath125 from @xmath12 , i.e. @xmath127 , with the constraint that @xmath128 .
the corresponding intrinsic scatters are reported in tabs .
[ tab : stat_cgrad_optnir ] and  [ tab : stat_cgrad_opt ] .
it should be noted that this procedure is only a simplistic way of estimating the internal scatter , as it holds only for gaussian distributions , which is not the case for the color gradient distributions ( see fig .
the @xmath126 increases from @xmath121 through @xmath123 , implying that the distribution of optical 
nir color gradients has a significant intrinsic dispersion .
the origin of this dispersion is analyzed in sec .
[ sec : cg_galpars ] , where we study the dependence of stellar population gradients in etgs on photometric and spectroscopic properties .
we also note that the fraction of galaxies having inverted ( positive ) color gradients becomes less and less pronounced when we move from optical  optical to optical 
nir wavebands . for @xmath129
, we find that only a small fraction of etgs ( @xmath130 ) exhibit positive color gradients ( @xmath131 ) . from the peak value of @xmath129 ( @xmath132 ) and the intrinsic width of the @xmath129 distribution ( @xmath133 ,
see tab .
2 ) , we estimate that only @xmath134 of galaxies in the optical+nir sample are expected to have positive @xmath123 gradients .
hence , the presence of a ( small ) fraction of objects with positive gradients is a real feature , and not merely explained by galaxies with negative gradients being scattered into the positive region by the measurement errors .
the peak values of @xmath109 are consistent , within the uncertainties , with those estimated by la barbera & de carvalho ( 2009 ) ( hereafter ldc09 ) for the entire spider sample of @xmath44 etgs with optical+nir data available .
a discrepancy is found for @xmath118 , for which ldc09 measured a peak value of @xmath135 , while we measure @xmath136 .
this difference does not affect the results of ldc09 , since our value of @xmath137 is fully consistent with those expected from the best - fitting stellar population models of color gradients in ldc09 ( see their fig .  1 ) .
the main differences between the sample of optical+nir color gradients in this work and that of ldc09 are that ( i ) we select only the etgs with better @xmath50 and more accurate structural parameters , and ( ii ) the computation of color gradients in ldc09 was slightly different than that performed here . we derive the color profiles using , for each band , the two - dimensional sersic model whose axis ratio and position angle parameters are those measured in that band . in ldc09 , we assumed the two dimensional sersic models in all bands to have the same axis ratios and position angles as those in the @xmath110-band .
this also explains why the color gradient distributions are broader than those measured in ldc09 ( see their tab .  1 ) .

the color gradient reflects the radial variation of stellar populations in a galaxy .
we can combine different estimates of color gradients from various pairs of available wavebands to infer the underlying stellar population gradient in an etg .
the approach we follow is presented , in general terms , in sec .
[ sec : approach ] . in sec .
[ sec : age_met_constrain ] we describe how this approach can be applied when the variation of stellar population properties is mainly due to age and metallicity .
we discuss the role of the filters available to spider in reducing the age  metallicity degeneracy . the results of this section
are then applied to the color gradient estimates in sec .
[ sec : grads ] to constrain radial variations of age and metallicity within etgs .
we consider two stellar populations characterized by different physical parameters , such as age , metallicity , @xmath179enhancement , etc . in general , the problem is how one can use the difference between the color indices of the two stellar populations to infer the corresponding difference(s ) in physical parameters .
the color index difference may be : ( i ) radial - the internal color gradient ; ( ii ) between galaxies with different masses - the fundamental plane coefficients in different wavebands ( see la barbera et al .
2010b ; hereafter paper ii ) ; ( iii ) in luminosity - the slope of the color - magnitude relation ; or ( iv ) in the residuals in luminosity about a given scaling relation .
we first describe the general approach we adopt , and then , in sec .  [ sec : grads ] , we focus on its application to point ( i ) .
we indicate as @xmath180 the variation of a given physical property between the two stellar populations , where the index @xmath181 runs over the considered set of properties .
the two stellar populations have differences in colors @xmath182 , where @xmath183 spans the set of colors defined by the available wavebands .
one can introduce the following approximations : @xmath184 where @xmath185 is the partial derivative of the j@xmath186 color index with respect to the i@xmath186 stellar population parameter .
the above equation holds if ( a ) the color indices are well behaved functions of the stellar population parameters and either ( b1 ) the @xmath180 are small enough to assume a linear approximation or ( b2 ) the color indices are linear functions of the stellar population parameters .
the quantities @xmath185 have to be evaluated at the average values of the stellar population parameters of the two stellar populations .
[ eq : deltaj ] can be solved in a @xmath50 sense , by minimizing the expression : @xmath187 requiring that the derivatives of @xmath50 with respect to @xmath188 vanish , one obtains the following system of equations : @xmath189 setting @xmath190 , we obtain a new system of @xmath191 linear equations in the @xmath191 unknown stellar population quantities @xmath188 : @xmath192 where the quantities @xmath193 are completely defined by the partial derivatives @xmath185 and the measured color differences @xmath194 . if the matrix @xmath193 is non - degenerate , we can invert the linear system of eqs .
[ deltaeqsol ] and derive a unique solution for the unknown quantities @xmath180 ( e.g. differences in age , metallicity , ... ) from the measured color differences @xmath182 .      in this section ,
we investigate how the color indices in spider can be used to constrain variations of stellar population properties in etgs , specifically the effects of age and metallicity .
since we analyze color gradients in the form @xmath109 ( sec .
[ sec : cg_estimates ] ) , we consider here color indices of the form @xmath113 , where @xmath91 is one of @xmath195 .
the @xmath108-band includes the 4000    break at the median redshift of the spider samples , making the @xmath113 colors most sensitive to the effects of stellar population variations .    for the optical sample ,
each etg is characterized by three independent colors , @xmath121 , @xmath196 , and @xmath124 . assuming that the relevant stellar population parameters are the age @xmath197 and metallicity @xmath198 , equations  [ deltaeq ] can be re - written as @xmath199 where @xmath200 and @xmath201 are the logarithmic differences of age and metallicity between two stellar populations .
as noted above ( see beginning of sec .  [
sec : approach ] ) , the quantities @xmath202 , @xmath203 , and @xmath204 could be the differences of color indices between galaxies having different parameters ( e.g mass ) , although here we focus on the case where @xmath205 is the difference in color index per radial decade in a galaxy , i.e. the internal color gradient ( @xmath206 ) . in this case
, the quantities @xmath200 and @xmath207 provide the difference in age and metallicity per radial decade ( i.e. @xmath208 and @xmath209 , see sec .
[ sec : calc_age_met_grads ] ) . using the formalism of sec .
[ sec : approach ] , @xmath210 and @xmath211 are derived by solving the linear system : @xmath212 where the matrix @xmath213 is computed directly from the partial derivative of color indices with respect to @xmath214 and @xmath215 , and the measured color differences @xmath202 , @xmath203 , and @xmath204 . for the optical+nir sample of etgs ,
the system of eqs .
[ age_met_system_a]  [ age_met_system_c ] includes four extra equations , corresponding to the @xmath216 , @xmath217 , @xmath218 , and @xmath123 color indices .
the quantities @xmath210 and @xmath211 are still obtained by solving the system of eqs .
[ age_met_solve_a][age_met_solve_b ] , where the matrix @xmath219 is defined by using the color differences in all available wavebands .    since the nir
light is far less sensitive to metallicity ( through line - blanketing ) than the optical , and is also less sensitive to age , we expect that including the nir wavebands helps to ( partly ) break the age - metallicity degeneracy , i.e. the degeneracy of the matrix @xmath220 is reduced when including all the @xmath113 color indices . to examine this , we set @xmath221 as a typical uncertainty in color differences .
we adopt this value of @xmath194 as it is an upper bound for the typical uncertainty on the mean value of color gradients .
in fact , the typical error on the color gradient of a given galaxy is @xmath53@xmath222 ( tab .  2 ) .
for the optical+nir sample of etgs , this implies a typical uncertainty on the mean color gradient of @xmath223@xmath224  @xmath222 ) , by the root square of the size of the optical+nir sample of etgs .
notice that the resulting expected errors on color gradients are slightly smaller than those on the peak values of @xmath109 ( @xmath225@xmath226 , see tab .
2 ) , as the peak values are estimated by the bi - weight ( rather than the mean ) statistics . ] . in order to estimate the derivatives of color indices with respect to age and metallicity
, we adopt a polynomial approximation of the magnitude of a given stellar population model with respect to @xmath197 and @xmath198 .
details of this approximation are provided in app .
[ sec : polfit ] . here
, we consider ssp models from the  @xcite synthesis code ( hereafter bc03 ) with a scalo imf .
we compute the matrix @xmath219 for different values of @xmath197 and @xmath198 of these ssp models , in the range where the polynomial approximation holds , i.e. @xmath227 and @xmath228 .
[ qval ] plots the determinant of the matrix @xmath220 , @xmath229 , as a function of @xmath230 for different metallicities .
the case where only optical colors are used is shown by the dashed curves .
@xmath231 is close to one for non - solar metallicity , while it is always smaller than one ( by almost an order of magnitude ) in the case of @xmath232 .
this implies that for solar metallicity the matrix @xmath213 is nearly degenerate and hence , as expected , optical colors alone are not able to effectively constrain age  metallicity variations .
the solid curves show the cases where all the optical+nir colors are used .
@xmath231 is then always greater than @xmath233 .
in particular , for solar metallicity , @xmath231 is two orders of magnitude greater than with optical colors alone , implying that using all of the @xmath52 wavebands places much better constraints on age and metallicity variations .    to illustrate this point more quantitatively , we perform monte - carlo simulations , setting @xmath234 and @xmath235 , which correspond to two stellar populations with a difference in age of @xmath236 and a factor of two difference in metallicity . these values of @xmath200 and @xmath201 are close to those of the mean age and metallicity internal gradient of etgs measured by ldc09 . using eqs .
[ eq : deltaj ] , we compute the color differences , @xmath194 , between the two stellar populations for all the seven @xmath113 colors .
the quantities @xmath185 are computed for @xmath237 and @xmath232 . for each iteration
, the color indices are shifted according to a normal distribution with a width of @xmath238 , and then we estimate @xmath200 and @xmath201 with the procedure outlined above .
the procedure is repeated twice , adopting ( i ) @xmath239 and using only the @xmath21 colors , and ( ii ) with @xmath240 and all the @xmath52 bands .
the above @xmath238 s represent the typical uncertainties on the mean internal color gradients in the optical and optical+nir spider samples of etgs ( see the errors on @xmath20 reported in tab .  [
tab : stat_cgrad_opt ] and tab .
[ tab : stat_cgrad_optnir ] , respectively ) .
[ age_met_var ] shows the distributions of inferred @xmath200 and @xmath201 . in both cases
, there is a strong correlation between @xmath200 and @xmath201 , implying that even with the full @xmath52 filter set , one can not completely break the age - metallicity degeneracy .
however , the amplitude of the correlated variation is much smaller in the case where the optical and nir bands are adopted .
in fact , although for case ( ii ) @xmath238 is larger than in case ( i ) , the corresponding error bars on @xmath200 and @xmath201 are much smaller , only @xmath241 for both @xmath197 and @xmath198 .
in other terms , optical+nir colors constrain the size of the age and metallicity differences more effectively . from fig.[age_met_var ] , we conclude that even a small age gradient of @xmath236 can be detected at @xmath242 with the optical+nir dataset .
in this section , we present our approach to constraining the variation of stellar population parameters with distance from the etg center . we consider only the effects of age and metallicity for simplicity , as the proper characterization of a given stellar population may require other quantities ( e.g. the shape of the imf ) . in app .  [
sec : age_met_bias ] , we describe the role of dust extinction gradients in etgs , discussing their possible impact on our results .
we first describe how we estimate the internal age and metallicity gradients ( sec .  [
sec : calc_age_met_grads ] ) . in sec .
[ sec : eff_grad ] , we show how our approach allows us to define an _ effective _ color gradient , @xmath243 , that results from a combination of all the available color gradients .
the systematics in @xmath243 estimates are then discussed in sec .
[ sec : err_eff_grad ] .
we adopt the procedure described in sec .
[ sec : age_met_constrain ] to infer the radial gradients in age ( @xmath244 ) and metallicity ( @xmath245 ) . setting @xmath246 in eqs .
[ age_met_system_a]  [ age_met_system_c ] , the quantities @xmath200 and @xmath201 become the logarithmic differences in age and metallicity per radial decade inside a galaxy , i.e. @xmath247 and @xmath248 .
[ age_met_system_a]  [ age_met_system_c ]
are then rewritten as follows : @xmath249 with @xmath250 . as shown in sec .
[ sec : age_met_constrain ] , in order to derive @xmath244 and @xmath245 , one has to solve the linear system : @xmath251 where the matrix @xmath213 is defined as in sec .
[ sec : approach ] , setting @xmath252 .
the computation of @xmath213 is performed using different stellar population models . for each model , we use eqs .
[ eq : age_met_solve_a2 ] and  [ eq : age_met_solve_b2 ] to derive the corresponding @xmath244 and @xmath245 .
this procedure , as presented in sec .
6 , minimizes the age - metallicity degeneracy depending on how many color terms are available and how they track the most conspicuous spectral features ( e.g. @xmath121 probes the 4000  break , yielding important information on the age of the underlying stellar population ) .
we consider ssp models from three different sources : bc03 , @xcite ( m05 ) , and charlot and bruzual ( 2009 , in preparation ; cb10 ) .
these models are based on different synthesis techniques and have different imfs .
the m05 model uses the fuel consumption approach instead of the isochrone synthesis of bc03 and cb10 .
the cb10 code implements a new agb phase treatment  @xcite .
the imfs are : scalo ( bc03 ) , chabrier ( m05 ) , and salpeter ( cb10 ) .
moreover , we also use a composite stellar population model from bc03 having exponential star formation rate ( sfr ) with an e - folding time of @xmath253  gyr ( hereafter @xmath254 ) .
the models are convolved with the @xmath52 throughput curves , and the polynomial approximation described in app .
[ sec : polfit ] is used to calculate the partial derivatives entering in @xmath220 .
the derivatives are computed assuming an age of @xmath255  gyr , corresponding to a formation redshift of @xmath256 at the median redshift of the spider sample ( @xmath257 ) , and solar metallicity ( @xmath232 ) . for each stellar population model and each galaxy ,
we perform @xmath119 iterations where in each of them we perturb the observed color gradients according to the corresponding uncertainties .
the errors on @xmath244 and @xmath245 are then the widths of their distributions resulting from all iterations .
note that in the above procedure all of the models are computed at the median redshift of our sample ( @xmath258 ) , neglecting the ( small ) redshift range of the sample . in app .
[ sec : age_met_bias ] , we show that this approximation does not affect our results .      as discussed in sec .
[ sec : age_met_constrain ] , even using the entire @xmath52 set of wavebands we can not break the age 
metallicity degeneracy .
this is further shown in fig .
[ fig : nabla_age_met_bc03 ] , where we plot the age versus metallicity gradients obtained with the above procedure , for the optical+nir sample , with the bc03 ssp models .
the @xmath245 and @xmath244 estimates are strongly correlated . as shown from the blue dashed line in fig .
[ fig : nabla_age_met_bc03 ] , obtained from an orthogonal least - squares fit of @xmath245 versus @xmath244 , the correlation is well described by a linear relation : @xmath259 the correlation is very similar to that between @xmath201 and @xmath200 in fig .
[ age_met_var ] .
this is shown by the red dotted line in fig .  [
fig : nabla_age_met_bc03 ] , which is obtained by a linear fit of @xmath245 versus @xmath244 with slope fixed to that of the red dot - dashed line in fig .
[ age_met_var ] .
the slopes of the blue dashed and red dotted lines differ by only @xmath260 , implying that the strong correlation of @xmath244 and @xmath245 is due mainly to correlated errors on differences in age and metallicity , such as the one between @xmath201 and @xmath200 shown in fig .  [ age_met_var ] .
in other terms , individual @xmath245 and @xmath244 estimates are affected by large , correlated statistical uncertainties because of the age 
metallicity degeneracy ( see the error ellipses in fig .  [
fig : nabla_age_met_bc03 ] ) .
however , as shown in sec .
[ sec : age_met_constrain ] , using optical+nir data allows _ unbiased estimates of the mean @xmath245 and @xmath244 to be obtained , provided that the number of galaxies is large enough to make statistical uncertainties on the means small enough relative to the absolute values of the differences in age and metallicity ( i.e. @xmath244 and @xmath245)_. this allows us to bin galaxies according to different properties and perform a meaningful comparison of the mean @xmath244 and @xmath245 among different bins ( see sec .
[ sec : age_met_grads ] ) .    in order to avoid the correlated uncertainties on individual @xmath244 and @xmath245 estimates
, we can define an _ effective _ color gradient : @xmath261 from a geometrical viewpoint , @xmath1 measures the distance of a given point in the @xmath262 plane along the @xmath245 direction to the line defining the age  metallicity degeneracy . by definition , the correlated variation of @xmath245 and @xmath244 , which is described by eq .
[ eq : rel_nabla_tz ] , does not change the @xmath243 .
hence , the effective color gradient is not affected by the age  metallicity degeneracy . for galaxies having no age gradients ,
@xmath243 reduces to the galaxy metallicity gradient .
moreover , since @xmath10 is negative ( see below ) , eq .
[ eq : nablas ] can be rewritten as @xmath263 this shows that when @xmath245@xmath264 , @xmath243 is directly proportional to the age gradient .
more generally , eq .  [ eq : nablas_mod ] shows that @xmath243 behaves like a color gradient .
a bluer outer stellar population relative to the inner one in a galaxy ( because of either a metallicity or age gradient ) yields a lower @xmath243 .
this is further shown in fig .
[ fig : nablas_cgrads ] , where we plot @xmath243 as a function of all the color gradients ( see sec .
[ sec : cg_estimates ] ) for the optical+nir sample of etgs . on average
, @xmath243 monotonically increases as a function of each @xmath109 .
in essence , @xmath1 can be seen as a color gradient that takes into account all of the colors .
using @xmath243 provides three important advantages over traditional color gradients .
first , because @xmath243 combines all of the color gradient , its statistical uncertainty is significantly smaller than that on any color gradient using one pair of passbands .
second , different samples ( bins ) of galaxies can be compared using just one quantity ( @xmath243 ) , rather than separately for each color gradient . finally , as we prove below ( sec .
[ sec : err_eff_grad ] ) , the effective color gradient is a completely model - independent quantity ( in the same way as the observed color gradients ) , which is not the case for @xmath245 and @xmath244 .    for each stellar population model , we derive @xmath10 via an orthogonal least - square fit of @xmath245 vs. @xmath244 for all galaxies . then we calculate @xmath1 for each galaxy , using eq .
[ eq : nablas ] .
the value of @xmath10 changes between different models , as well as for a given model when using a different set of wavebands ( i.e. optical vs. optical+nir ) . for the optical+nir wavebands ,
we obtain @xmath265 ( bc03 ) , @xmath266 ( cb10 ) , @xmath267 ( @xmath254 ) , and  @xmath268 ( m05 ) .
for the optical wavebands , we obtain @xmath269 and  @xmath270 , respectively .
we examine how sensitive @xmath243  is to varying the set of utilized wavebands .
this is shown in fig .
[ fig : conf_gradstar_optnir ] , where we compare the @xmath243  measured with optical+nir and only optical bands .
these two values of @xmath243  are linearly related , indicating that optical data alone can still provide a reliable estimate of the _ effective _ color gradient .
this is consistent with the fact that @xmath243 is not affected by the age - metallicity degeneracy ( influencing the optical more than the optical+nir gradients ) and is also proportional to each of the color gradients . on the other hand ,
the slope of the correlation between @xmath243 ( optical ) and @xmath243 ( optical+nir ) is significantly greater than one at @xmath271 .
this reflects the reduced statistical uncertainty on @xmath243  when incorporating the nir information .
this is further shown in fig .
[ fig : conf_dist_grads ] where we compare the histograms of @xmath243 obtained using optical and optical+nir data .
the width of the @xmath243   distribution is significantly larger when using optical @xmath272 optical+nir data .
also , a small offset in the peak of the two distributions is present .
these results are quantified in tab .
[ tab : stat_nablas ] where we report the statistics , i.e. the peak ( @xmath20 ) and width ( @xmath12 ) as estimated using the bi - weight estimator  @xcite , for different samples and stellar population models . in the same table
, we also report the median uncertainty , @xmath273 , as well as the intrinsic width , @xmath274 , defined in the same way as the quantity @xmath126 in sec .
[ sec : dist_cgs ] . from these data
we conclude that for the optical+nir sample , the peaks of the @xmath243 distributions are consistent for different stellar population models , i.e. the @xmath243 estimated from optical+nir is model - independent .
in contrast , when using only optical data , a significant systematic different is present between the peak values of different models , though this difference is quite small ( @xmath275 ) @xmath7 the absolute peak value of @xmath243 .
furthermore , in agreement with fig .
[ fig : conf_dist_grads ] , we see that @xmath12 is significantly larger when using optical data ( @xmath276 ) as opposed to using optical+nir data ( @xmath277 ) , i.e. @xmath243 is affected by significantly larger uncertainties ( by a factor of @xmath278 ) when using only optical data . finally , the peak values of the optical and optical+nir @xmath243 are slightly different , in the sense that the _ effective _ color gradients are on average more negative by @xmath279 for the optical+nir than for the optical samples
. the differences in @xmath20 might be due to the different shapes of the optical and optical+nir @xmath243 distributions , rather than some intrinsic difference .
in fact , as seen in fig .  [
fig : conf_dist_grads ] , the distribution of @xmath243(optical ) is clearly asymmetric .

[ fig : conf_gradstar_models ] , where we compare the @xmath314 s obtained using the optical+nir sample of etgs for bc03 and m05 .
we see that the scatter in @xmath243 is significantly reduced in comparison to that for @xmath245 or @xmath244 . as noted above
, @xmath243 is model - independent , while this is obviously not the case for @xmath245 and @xmath244 .
this gives extra support to using @xmath243 as a useful and robust representation of the radial gradients of stellar population properties in galaxies .
from table 4 we see that the stellar population gradients exhibit significant intrinsic dispersion , motivating an analysis of the correlations of @xmath243 versus other galaxy parameters .
we study correlations of @xmath243 with several photometric quantities ( sec .
[ sec : corr_strpar ] ) , different estimates of galaxy mass ( sec .
[ sec : corr_mass ] ) , and spectroscopic parameters like central velocity dispersion and stellar population indicators like age , metallicity and @xmath8 $ ] abundance ratio ( sec .
[ sec : corr_sppar ] ) .
because of the large statistical uncertainty on individual measures of stellar population gradients , we bin the data and analyze trends with the mean @xmath243 . in each case , we verified that changing the number of galaxies in each bin does not affect our results .
the results presented in the following subsections refer to @xmath243 computed using the bc03 ssp models .
similar findings hold when considering other stellar population models described in sec .
[ sec : grads ] .
we bin @xmath243 with respect to the following photometric parameters : r- and k - band effective half - light radii , ( @xmath315 and @xmath316 ) ; r- and k - band total magnitudes ( @xmath317 and @xmath318 ) , obtained through a psf - convolved sersic modeling of the galaxy image ; logarithmic median sersic index ( @xmath319 ) ; median axis ratio ( @xmath320 ) ; the @xmath321 parameter , which characterizes the galaxy isophotal shape ( boxiness - a@xmath322 0 and diskyness - a@xmath323 0 , see  paper i ) ; the optical - nir color index ( @xmath324 ) and the median psf fitting @xmath325 ( @xmath326 , fig .
[ fig : grads_par ] ) . for each galaxy ,
median values are computed using data at the available wavebands , i.e. @xmath21 and @xmath52 .
we adopted the @xmath110- and @xmath63-band radii and magnitudes as representative of the sizes and luminosities of galaxies in the optical and nir spectral regions , respectively .
the @xmath324 color index is estimated using 2dphot total galaxy magnitudes .
each bin includes the same number of galaxies , i.e. @xmath327 etgs for the optical+nir sample and @xmath328 etgs for the optical sample .
[ fig : grads_par ] shows the relations between @xmath243 and the photometric quantities listed above .
panels ( a ) and ( c ) show that @xmath243 changes significantly with the r - band effective radius and @xmath110-band total absolute magnitude in the sense that larger and more optically luminous etgs have stronger ( more negative ) effective color gradients .
this result is somewhat expected as a more negative @xmath243 implies that bluer ( either less metal rich or younger ) stars in the galaxy are preferentially distributed towards the galaxy periphery .
we note that the trend with @xmath317 is weaker than that with @xmath315 . when we restrict ourselves to only optical data the trends with radius and magnitude are less pronounced ( see below ) .
moreover , @xmath243 has no dependence on radius or luminosity when we use @xmath63-band ( panels b and d ) .
this finding is of particular interest , as the nir light follows more closely the stellar mass distribution than the optical light .
it implies that for bright etgs the effective color gradient does not vary significantly along the stellar mass sequence .
a mild correlation exists between @xmath243 and sersic index , as shown in panel ( e ) . for @xmath329 ( @xmath330 )
etgs with higher @xmath48 tend to have stronger effective color gradients , likely because galaxies with higher @xmath48 have higher luminosity due to the ( optical ) luminosity  sersic index relation of etgs  @xcite .
panel ( f ) shows no trend whatsoever of @xmath243 with axis ratio while with the boxy / disky parameter @xmath321 , shown in panel ( g ) , a weak correlation is present especially when optical+nir data is used . in panel
( h ) we show that a strong correlation exists between @xmath243 and total galaxy colors . for @xmath331
, galaxies with bluer colors also tend to have stronger gradients .
this is not a spurious result arising from the correlation of galaxy colors and magnitudes .
in fact , the color - magnitude relation implies that brighter galaxies should have redder colors .
this , together with the trend of @xmath243 with @xmath317 , would produce a trend opposite to that seen in panel ( h ) .
moreover , as shown in  paper i , no significant correlation is found between total magnitudes and total ( rather than aperture ) galaxy colors .
finally , panel ( i ) probes possible systematics in color gradient estimates related to the psf modeling .
it shows that @xmath243 is not correlated with the @xmath50 from fitting the galaxy image with a psf convolved srsic light distribution .
hence , our psf models are accurate enough to provide , on average , unbiased @xmath243 estimates .    in summary
, we find that the effective color gradient in ( bright ) etgs do not correlate with ( nir ) luminosities and galaxy radii , while a correlation exists with galaxy colors .
the former finding is further investigated in the next section , where we analyze the trend of @xmath243 with galaxy mass .
the correlation of @xmath243 with colors is further studied in sec .
[ sec : corr_sppar ] , where we bin @xmath243 with respect to the stellar population parameters of etgs .    the lack of correlation between @xmath243 and @xmath332 ( panel b of fig .
[ fig : grads_par ] ) deserves further comments . in paper ii we show that the ratio of optical ( @xmath108-band ) to nir ( @xmath63-band ) effective radii , @xmath333 decreases as a function of @xmath334 , with the largest galaxies having @xmath335 ( see fig .  7 of paper ii ) .
this variation implies that the slope of the kormendy relation for etgs increases from @xmath108 through @xmath63 . a similar result , at optical wavebands ( @xmath121 ) , has been recently reported by  @xcite . using the ratio of optical radii as a proxy for the color gradient ,
the decrease of @xmath333 with @xmath332 implies that larger galaxies should have shallower gradients ( see also tortora et al .
2010 ) , in contrast with the lack of correlation in panel b of fig .
[ fig : grads_par ] . however , color gradients are determined not only from the ratio of effective radii but also from that of the sersic indices .
in fact , the variation of the surface brightness profile between two wavebands is determined from both @xmath336 and @xmath48 .
[ fig : ng_nk ] plots the logarithmic binned ratio of @xmath108 to @xmath63-band sersic indices , @xmath337 , as a function of @xmath338 .
we find that @xmath339 decreases as a function of @xmath332 , i.e. larger galaxies are more concentrated in the nir than lower-@xmath340 systems .
this compensates for the trend of @xmath333 with @xmath332 , making @xmath243 nearly constant with nir radius .
thus there is no inconsistency between the lack of correlation in panel b of fig .
[ fig : grads_par ] and the correlation shown in fig .  7 of paper ii .
as mentioned above , we find that color gradients exhibit a complex behavior with galaxy luminosity .
when estimated from optical+nir color gradients , @xmath243 becomes more negative as the optical magnitude becomes brighter . on the contrary , for the optical sample of etgs ,
i.e. when @xmath243 is estimated from @xmath116 , @xmath117 , and @xmath118 , this steepening disappears , and @xmath243 does not vary with @xmath341 ( panel c of fig .  [
fig : grads_par ] ) .
the reason for the different behavior of @xmath243 , when estimated using optical _ vs. _ optical+nir data is illustrated in fig .
[ fig : nabla_gx_mag ] , where we plot the median color gradient , @xmath109 , as a function of the optical magnitude for all the available wavebands ( @xmath250 ) .
the trends of @xmath109 with @xmath317 are modeled with second - order polynomials ( dashed curves in the figure ) .
the most remarkable feature is that the color gradient variation with magnitude depends on the waveband .
the @xmath116 gradient exhibits a double - valued behavior , becoming flatter in both more and less luminous galaxies . for @xmath118 ,
the double - valued behavior disappears and the @xmath314 decreases monotonically as a function of @xmath317 . at redder wavebands ,
the trend reverses , and @xmath342 becomes a monotonically increasing function of @xmath317 . as shown in fig .
[ fig : nablas_cgrads ] , the effective color gradient is proportional to each of the individual color gradients from which it is estimated .
when using optical data alone , @xmath243 mainly reflects the behavior of @xmath116 , @xmath117 , and @xmath118 . as a result
, @xmath243 exhibits no strong variation with luminosity , similar to the double - valued behavior of @xmath116 .
when @xmath243 is estimated from optical+nir data , the optical - nir gradients dominate the trend , with @xmath243 an increasing function of @xmath317 .
the main conclusion is that the behavior of color gradients with luminosity depends on the waveband where the luminosity is estimated ( panels c and d of fig .
[ fig : grads_par ] ) , as well as the wavebands used to estimate the gradient itself .
this complex dependence may explain , at least partly , the discrepant results found in the literature about the relation between color gradients and luminosity ( mass ) .
for instance , @xcite first reported a surprising lack of correlation between color gradients and galaxy luminosity , noting that brightest ellipticals do not exhibit less steep gradients , as expected if they were the debris of repeated mergers of lower mass systems .
@xcite also reported no correlation between the size of the color gradients and galaxy luminosity .
@xcite found that color gradients in cluster etgs become steeper ( more negative ) in brighter galaxies .
the same result was found by  @xcite for the bulges of spiral galaxies . on the other hand
, @xcite found that color gradients do not depend on galaxy luminosity , and  @xcite found that optical color gradients are essentially constant over a wide range of galaxy luminosity , with a weak trend of becoming flatter at both fainter and brighter magnitudes . recently ,
* hereafter rbh10 ) , using the ratio of @xmath108- to @xmath110-band effective radii from the sdss as a proxy for the color gradient , also found that etgs with intermediate luminosity have stronger gradients than those at low and high luminosities , in agreement with the double - valued behavior we observe for @xmath116 .
[ fig : grads_masses ] plots the median @xmath243 as a function of galaxy stellar ( @xmath2 ) and dynamical ( @xmath3 ) mass .
the binning is performed as in fig .
[ fig : grads_par ] , with each bin having the same number of galaxies . to quantify the dependence of @xmath243 on mass , we perform linear least - squares fits of @xmath243 with respect to @xmath2 and @xmath3 , with the slopes reported in the figure .
we find no trend of the effective color gradient with mass .
in particular , the slope of @xmath243 vs. @xmath3 is consistent with zero at the @xmath343 significance level , while the slope of @xmath243 vs. @xmath66 is consistent with zero at @xmath344 .
for @xmath345 , the @xmath243 becomes more negative than at higher mass , but this effect might not be real , as in this mass regime , the spider sample is incomplete due to the @xmath110-band magnitude selection ( see fig .  [
fig : mpetr_mdyn ] ) .
we verified that the trend with stellar mass remains unchanged when using different stellar population models ( e.g. cb10 ) to perform the sed fitting ( sec .
[ sec : stellar_masses ] ) .
[ fig : grads_spar ] plots the median effective color gradient , @xmath243 , as a function of central velocity dispersion , age , metallicity , and @xmath10-enhancement , for both the optical and optical+nir samples . for the optical
, the plot of @xmath243 vs. @xmath346 seems to suggest a double - valued behavior , with @xmath243 reaching a minimum around @xmath347 .
however , this is not confirmed by the optical+nir data , where no trend appears .
this result supports the findings of secs .
[ sec : corr_strpar ] and  [ sec : corr_mass ] , that @xmath243 is not driven by galaxy mass . on the contrary , we find a strong dependence of @xmath243 on stellar population properties , i.e. the age , @xmath84 $ ] , and @xmath8 $ ] . in order to quantify these trends
, we perform a robust linear fit of @xmath243 as a function of each of the three parameters , minimizing the sum of absolute residuals in @xmath243 .
the uncertainties on fitting coefficients are estimated by the width of their distribution among @xmath348 iterations , where the median @xmath243 in each bin are shifted according to their error bars , and the fitting process is repeated .
the slope and offset of the best - fit lines are reported in tab .
[ tab : fit_grads_sppar ] . from panel ( b ) , we see that the effective color gradient is flat for galaxies with older stellar populations .
the trend is statistically significant for both the optical and optical+nir samples , with the slopes of @xmath243 vs. @xmath15 relations greater than zero at @xmath349 and @xmath350  @xmath12 , respectively .
we note that galaxies with ages younger than @xmath351  gyr seems not to follow the same trend as galaxies with older ages .
as discussed below , this inversion in the trend of @xmath243 with @xmath15 is caused by galaxies with faint spiral - like morphological features and less accurate structural parameters .
the behavior of @xmath243 with metallicity is less clear . for the optical sample , the slope of the @xmath243 vs. @xmath84 $ ] best - fit relation is larger than zero at over 7  @xmath12
however , the trend is only weakly detected in the optical+nir sample , where the slope is only marginally larger than zero , at @xmath352  @xmath12 .
we find that @xmath243 strongly depends on the @xmath10-enhancement parameter , in the sense that galaxies with larger @xmath8 $ ] also have shallower effective color gradients .
the slope of the best - fitting line is significantly different from zero , at more than 5  @xmath12 , for both the optical and optical+nir samples .

, we define a purer sample of etgs , where contamination is reduced to at most 5  @xmath366 . to analyze
if the trends of @xmath243 with stellar population properties are affected by the presence of late - type contaminants , we define two subsamples of etgs , by matching the optical and optical+nir samples with the lower contamination sample of  paper i. we also select only galaxies with better quality structural parameters , by removing objects whose two - dimensional fitting @xmath50 in any of the available wavebands is larger than @xmath367 ( see  paper i ) .
the optical and optical+nir subsamples include @xmath368 and @xmath369 etgs , respectively .
[ fig : grads_spar_best ] plots the same trends as in fig .
[ fig : grads_spar ] but for the better quality subsamples .
the coefficients of the best - fitting lines of @xmath243 vs. age , metallicity , and enhancement , are reported in tab .
[ tab : fit_grads_sppar_nocont ] .
the better quality subsamples exhibit trends fully consistent with those obtained for the full samples . in the case of @xmath243 vs. age , we do not find that galaxies with younger ages ( @xmath370  gyr ) have flatter gradients , as found for the full samples .
a further issue is that of the fixed aperture size ( @xmath82 sdss fiber radius ) where the stellar population properties are measured . because of radial gradients in stellar population properties , this fixed aperture size might produce a correlation of the estimated @xmath15 , @xmath84 $ ] , and @xmath8 $ ] , parameters with galaxy radius . since the @xmath243 s correlate with the ( optical ) @xmath371 ( see panel a of fig .
[ fig : grads_par ] ) , the aperture effect might also bias the correlation of the @xmath314 s with @xmath15 , @xmath84 $ ] , and @xmath8 $ ] .
however , as shown in app .

in order to separate the contribution of age and metallicity to @xmath243 , we restrict the analysis to the optical+nir sample of etgs , as optical data alone are completely ineffective at disentangling the two components ( see sec .  [
sec : age_met_constrain ] ) .
first , we analyze the statistics of the distributions of age and metallicity gradients ( sec .  [
sec : age_met_stat ] ) .
[ sec : age_met_trends ] deals with the trends of @xmath244 and @xmath245 with respect to different proxies of galaxy mass , as well as stellar population parameters . in sec .
[ sec : age_met_mass ] , the same trends are analyzed separately for low- and high - mass galaxies . in app .
[ sec : age_met_bias ] , we also discuss some possible sources of bias in the trends of age and metallicity gradients , such as the role of internal reddening gradients in etgs .      in tab .
[ tab : stat_nablas_tz ] , we report the peak of the distributions of age ( @xmath384 ) and metallicity ( @xmath385 ) gradients for all the stellar population models described in sec .  [
sec : grads ] . in agreement with previous works
( e.g.  @xcite ) , we find that color gradients imply the presence of a negative metallicity gradient in etgs ( @xmath386 ) , with the outer stellar populations being less metal - rich than the inner ones .
the peak value of @xmath245 spans the range of @xmath387 to @xmath122 , depending on the stellar population model . in agreement with our previous work ( ldc09 )
, we find that the peak @xmath244 is significantly greater than zero , i.e. etgs have on average younger stars in the center than the outskirts .
@xmath244 ranges from @xmath388 to @xmath102 , being significantly larger than zero for all models .
hence , as discussed in ldc09 , the existence of a small , but significantly positive age gradient is a robust ( model - independent ) result . from the values of @xmath245 and @xmath244 we see that , for all models , metallicity is the main driver of color gradients .

[ fig : allgrads_pars ] plots the median @xmath245 ( red circles ) and @xmath244 ( blue squares ) in different bins of stellar population parameters ( age , metallicity , and enhancement ) , velocity dispersion , stellar and dynamical mass . for each bin of a given quantity
, we also show the median @xmath243 in that bin ( black triangles ) .
@xmath243 , @xmath245 and @xmath244 are estimated using bc03 ssp models .
age gradients are multiplied by the absolute value of the @xmath10 parameter ( see sec .  [

[ eq : nablas ] ) .
this allows us to analyze the relative contribution of age and metallicity to the trends of color gradients @xmath7 the different quantities :      for _ massive _ galaxies , i.e. @xmath397@xmath398 ( @xmath399 ) , @xmath400 , and @xmath401 , the lack of correlation between @xmath243 and either @xmath38 , @xmath2 , or @xmath3 ( see secs .  [
sec : corr_mass ] and  [ sec : corr_sppar ] ) is the result of opposing variations of metallicity and age gradients @xmath7 such quantities .
the @xmath245 _ decreases _ while the @xmath244 _ increases _ as the mass proxy increases .
the two trends cancel each other in the resulting color gradients .
the origin of this opposite behavior is visible in fig .
[ fig : nabla_gx_mag ] .
more luminous ( massive ) galaxies have flatter optical - optical color gradients ( e.g.  @xmath116 ) and steeper optical - nir gradients than lower mass systems . because of the age 
metallicity degeneracy , a flatter @xmath116 may be due either to a positive age gradient in concert with a negative metallicity gradient , or an intrinsically weaker metallicity gradient .
the latter case is excluded by the optical - nir gradients , as this would make the @xmath129 flatten with mass , while we observe the opposite trend .
[ fig : allgrads_pars ] also shows that low- ( relative to high- ) mass galaxies exhibit different trends . for @xmath397@xmath402 and @xmath403 , no significant correlation of @xmath245 and @xmath244 with mass proxy
is seen , while for low-@xmath3 objects ( @xmath404 ) a more complex behavior is observed . to illustrate this , we define two characteristic dynamical masses , @xmath405 and @xmath406 , marked by the vertical dashed lines in panel ( f ) of fig .
[ fig : allgrads_pars ] . for @xmath407
down to @xmath408 , there is no significant correlation of @xmath245 and @xmath244 with @xmath3 , while for @xmath409 the metallicity gradient tends to _ decrease _ , while the age gradient tends to _ increase _ , as @xmath3 decreases .
however , in this mass regime the spider sample becomes incomplete because of the @xmath110-band magnitude selection ( see sec .
[ sec : samples ] ) .
we find that all the above trends are essentially unchanged regardless of the stellar population models used to estimate the age and metallicity gradients ( see sec .
[ sec : grads ] ) .      for galaxies older than @xmath410  gyr ,
we find that @xmath245 decreases , while @xmath244 increases as a function of the @xmath15 parameter .
the trend of @xmath244 is stronger than that of @xmath245 , making the color gradient , @xmath243 , increase with @xmath15 ( see sec .
[ sec : corr_sppar ] ) .
for the m05 and @xmath254 models , the behavior of @xmath244 and @xmath245 with @xmath15 is the same as for bc03 ssp models . on the other hand , for @xmath411
, we find no significant variation of @xmath245 with @xmath15 , while @xmath244 still increases with the @xmath15 .
this confirms that the trend of color gradients with age , for @xmath412  gyr , are mainly because of @xmath244 . for galaxies with @xmath413  gyr , the trends of @xmath245 and @xmath244 reverse .
lower ages imply more negative ( positive ) metallicity ( age ) gradients . even in this case
, the @xmath244 dominates the trend , and the resulting color gradient increases as the @xmath15 decreases .
this result holds for all the different stellar population models .      for galaxies more metal - rich than @xmath84
\sim -0.12 $ ] , the @xmath245 tends to decrease , while the @xmath244 tends to increase as metallicity increases .
the two trends cancel each other producing no variation of the median color gradient , @xmath243 , as a function of the @xmath84 $ ] parameter , consistent with the @xmath243@xmath84 $ ] slope reported in tab .
[ tab : fit_grads_sppar_nocont ] for the optical+nir sample of etgs .
the trends of @xmath245 and @xmath244 seem to reverse at low metallicity , i.e. @xmath84 \widetilde { < } -0.12 $ ] , similar to that observed for @xmath15 . in this regime , the variation of color gradient with @xmath84 $ ] is dominated by @xmath245 , which becomes more negative as @xmath84 $ ] decreases .
we found the behavior of @xmath244 and @xmath245 with @xmath414 to be independent of the adopted stellar population model .
in contrast to the trends with age and metallicity , we do not find any significant variation of @xmath244 with @xmath8 $ ] .
[ fig : allgrads_pars ] reveals that the strong correlation of @xmath243 with enhancement is because of the metallicity gradient decreasing with @xmath8 $ ] .
since the trend of age and metallicity gradients @xmath7 different mass proxies depends on the range of galaxy mass , we bin the sample of etgs according to @xmath3 , and analyze the trends of @xmath245 and @xmath244 in each bin .
we define two bins , including _ low- _ ( @xmath415 ) , and _
high-_mass ( @xmath416 ) galaxies , where @xmath417 and @xmath418 are defined above .
although the sample of etgs becomes incomplete at @xmath419 , we adopt a slightly lower mass limit of @xmath420 , as this is approximately the @xmath3 at which the trend of @xmath244 and @xmath245 with mass changes behavior ( see panel f of fig .  [
fig : allgrads_pars ] ) .    figs .
[ fig : allgrads_pars_low ] and  [ fig : allgrads_pars_high ] are the same as fig .
[ fig : allgrads_pars ] , but plot only galaxies in the low- and high - mass bins , respectively . in order to quantify the trends of @xmath244 , @xmath245 , and @xmath243 @xmath7 a given parameter , we fit each trend with a linear relation , minimizing the sum of absolute residuals of median gradients ( see sec .
[ sec : corr_strpar ] ) .
the slopes and their uncertainties are reported in tabs .  [
tab : fit_nablas_low ] and  [ tab : fit_nablas_high ] for the low- and high - mass bins , respectively . from figs .
[ fig : allgrads_pars_low ] and  [ fig : allgrads_pars_high ] , as well as tabs .
[ tab : fit_nablas_low ] and  [ tab : fit_nablas_high ] , we see that :    the _ effective _ color gradient , @xmath243 , does not show any significant correlation with either @xmath38 or @xmath3 , while it tends to marginally decrease with stellar mass , as the @xmath243@xmath2 slope in tab .  [ tab : fit_nablas_low ] is less than zero ( @xmath421 ) at the @xmath422 confidence level .
no significant trend of @xmath245 and @xmath244 is detected @xmath7 any mass proxy ( @xmath3 , @xmath66 , and @xmath38 ) .
on the other hand , for stellar population parameters , we find that @xmath243 strongly correlates with @xmath15 and @xmath8 $ ] .
the _ effective _ color gradient increases for larger @xmath15 , and becomes more negative as the @xmath8 $ ] increases .
the slopes of the @xmath243@xmath15 and @xmath243@xmath8 $ ] linear fits differ from zero at more than @xmath423 , proving that the trends are highly significant .
the @xmath243 also tends to increase with metallicity , but the slope of the @xmath243@xmath84 $ ] fit is larger than zero at only @xmath422 . as noted above , the trend of @xmath243 with @xmath15 is mainly due to @xmath244 , while that with @xmath8 $ ] is driven by @xmath245 .    for high - mass galaxies , the _ effective _ color gradient does not vary significantly with @xmath15 , metallicity nor with any mass proxy .
in fact , the slopes of the correlations involving @xmath243 in tab .  [
tab : fit_nablas_high ] are all consistent with zero at less than @xmath424 . for the @xmath8 $ ]
, there is a significant trend of @xmath243 decreasing as the enhancement increases .
the slope of the @xmath243@xmath8 $ ] linear fit ( @xmath425 ) differs from zero at over @xmath423 , and is consistent with that obtained for low - mass etgs ( @xmath426 , see tab .
[ tab : fit_nablas_low ] ) and for the entire sample ( @xmath427 , see tab .
[ tab : fit_grads_sppar ] ) .
for all quantities , we find anti - correlated variations of @xmath245 and @xmath244 , which cancel each other in the trends of @xmath243 . for @xmath8 $ ]
, the metallicity gradient dominates , resulting in the strong correlation of @xmath243 and @xmath8 $ ] .    from figs .
[ fig : allgrads_pars ] ,  [ fig : allgrads_pars_low ] and  [ fig : allgrads_pars_high ] , we see that positive age gradients in etgs are more associated with high rather than low mass galaxies . at high mass ,
the age gradient strongly increases as a function @xmath38 , @xmath3 , and to a lesser extent with stellar mass , while these trends are not observed for low - mass galaxies .
however , for both low- and high - mass , @xmath244 becomes significantly positive for galaxies older than @xmath428  gyr .
this implies that age gradients in etgs are mainly driven by mass , and only secondarily by @xmath15 .
panel ( b ) of fig .
[ fig : allgrads_pars ] also shows that for @xmath429  gyr , the trend of @xmath244 with @xmath15 reverses : the younger the age , the more positive the age gradient becomes .
consistent with the downsizing picture ( @xcite ) , galaxies at @xmath429  gyr are low - mass systems , as shown by the inversion in the @xmath244-@xmath15 trend being observed only for the low - mass bin ( panel b of fig .
[ fig : allgrads_pars_low ] ) .
stellar population parameters , such as @xmath15 , metallicity , and enhancement , are known to correlate with proxies of galaxy mass , such as velocity dispersion and stellar mass ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . since for high - mass galaxies
we find that internal gradients correlate with both mass and stellar population properties , a natural question is if these trends are just because of the correlation among stellar population properties and mass . in order to address this issue
, we apply a correction procedure that _ removes _ the correlations of each @xmath314 quantity with mass from all the trends in figs .
[ fig : allgrads_pars_low ] and  [ fig : allgrads_pars_high ] .
the procedure is illustrated in fig .

[
fig : corr_proc ] ) . comparing top and bottom panels in    fig .
[ fig : corr_proc ] illustrates how the correction procedure ( partly )    removes the correlations of @xmath243 ,    @xmath245 , and @xmath244 with    @xmath84 $ ] .
we apply this correction scheme for both low- and high - mass etgs , modeling the @xmath314s-@xmath3 trends ( point i. above ) independently for each case .
we obtain the following results :    fig .
[ fig : allgrads_pars_highmass_corr_mdyn ] exhibits the correlations of @xmath243 , @xmath245 , and @xmath244 , with different quantities , for high - mass galaxies ( @xmath430 ) , _ after removing _ the @xmath314s-@xmath3 trends . by construction
, the procedure removes the correlations of the @xmath314 s with @xmath3 ( panel f ) .
however , it does not impact the trends involving stellar population properties .
this is because such trends are due to the @xmath431 correlations ( rather than @xmath314s-@xmath3 ) .
this is shown in fig .
[ fig : allgrads_pars_highmass_corr_sig0 ] , where we repeat the entire procedure by removing the @xmath314s-@xmath38 trends .
the @xmath314s-@xmath38 corrections remove all the trends , with the remarkable exception of the correlations among @xmath243 ( @xmath245 ) and the enhancement .
a linear fit to the @xmath243@xmath8 $ ] trend in fig .
[ fig : allgrads_pars_highmass_corr_sig0 ] gives a slope of @xmath432 , still fully consistent with that of the uncorrected trend ( @xmath433 , see tab .
[ tab : fit_nablas_high ] ) .    in the mass range of @xmath417 to @xmath418 , there is no variation of @xmath243 with velocity dispersion or dynamical mass .
hence , the correlations between gradients and stellar population parameters can not arise from age , metallicity , and enhancement varying with mass
. however , at a given @xmath38 , the stellar population parameters are correlated with each other , with age being anti - correlated with both metallicity and enhancement  @xcite . to account for this , we re -
derive the trends between the @xmath314 s and other parameters by removing the correlations with the @xmath15 .
the procedure is the same as that adopted to remove the @xmath314s-@xmath3 and @xmath314s-@xmath38 correlations for high - mass galaxies ( see above ) .
[ fig : allgrads_pars_lowmass_corr_age ] shows the same plots as fig .
[ fig : allgrads_pars_low ] , but after the @xmath314s-@xmath15 trends are removed .
we see that this correction does not affect significantly the correlations of the @xmath314 s @xmath7 metallicity and enhancement .
in particular , after the correction is applied , a linear fit of @xmath243 @xmath7 @xmath414 gives a slope of @xmath434 , fully consistent with that of @xmath435 reported in tab .
[ tab : fit_nablas_low ] . for @xmath243 versus @xmath8 $ ] , the slope is @xmath436 , still consistent with that in tab .
[ tab : fit_nablas_low ] ( @xmath437 ) .
it follows that , for low - mass systems , all the correlations of internal gradients with stellar population parameters are independent of each other , i.e. the gradients exhibit a genuine correlation with each single parameter ( in particular age and enhancement ) .

in this paper , we examined a sample of 4,546 etgs with @xmath52 data available .
we consider an etg to be a bulge - dominated galaxy with a passive spectrum in its central region ( within the sdss fiber ) . as such
, the results obtained here do not apply exclusively to ellipticals , but to s0 galaxies and galaxies with a red central bulge ( although the effect of late - type contaminants is expected to be negligible , see secs .
3.3 and  8.3 ) .
however , there is no a priori reason to expect that the formation mechanisms and evolutionary pathways are the same for all sub - classes of what we call etgs .
we measured structural parameters in all wavebands and stellar population indicators from the spectra .
we describe a new approach to constrain age and metallicity gradients from the color information . also , we define an effective color gradient , @xmath1 , that uses all the color terms provided by the photometric data and investigate its dependence on several parameters like age , metallicity , mass and @xmath8 $ ] . although the estimate of stellar population parameters ( sec .
[ sec : stellar_pop ] ) and that of stellar masses and age / metallicity gradients rely on different stellar population models ( bc03 vs. miles ) , we find that all trends shown here remain unchanged when using a variety of population synthesis models to infer the gradients and estimate stellar masses . in the following we summarize our main findings :    1 ) : :    we present a new scheme to quantify stellar population gradients from    color gradients .
we introduce an effective color gradient ,    @xmath1 , which reflects all contributions from    the optical+nir colors .
@xmath1 correlates well    with all color gradients measured independently ( as expected ) and is    model independent , while @xmath478 and    @xmath479 ( i.e. the metallicity and age gradients )    are not .
2 ) : :    for photometric properties , we find that @xmath1    has a mild correlation with the sersic index ; does not change at all    with the axis ratio ; and strongly correlates with total galaxy color -    systems with bluer colors tend to have more negative    @xmath1 .
using optical+nir data we also find that    larger and more luminous etgs have more negative    @xmath1 s , although if we restrict ourselves to    only @xmath63-band data , @xmath1 shows no    dependence on radius or luminosity .
3 ) : :    for galaxies more massive than    @xmath480 , the age gradient increases , while the metallicity    gradient decreases as functions of mass , age , metallicity , and    enhancement .
the trends cancel each other in the color gradient , with    the exception of those for the enhancement : the color gradient    decreases as a function of @xmath8 $ ] .
all trends are a    consequence of the correlations of the @xmath314 s    @xmath7 both velocity dispersion and    @xmath8 $ ] .
these parameters are the main drivers of    the internal age , metallicity , and color gradients in massive etgs .
4 ) : :    for less massive galaxies , @xmath481 , no strong    correlation of age , metallicity , and color gradients is detected    @xmath7 mass
. however , color gradients strongly correlate    with stellar population parameters , and these correlations are    independent of each other .
5 ) : :    in both mass regimes , there is a strong anti - correlation between the    color gradient and @xmath10-enhancement , that originates    from the metallicity gradient decreasing with    @xmath8 $ ] .
this could result from the star formation    and metallicity enrichment being regulated by the interplay between    the input of energy from supernovae , and the temperature and pressure    of the hot x - ray gas in etgs .
6 ) : :    in both mass regimes , positive age gradients are associated with old    galaxy ages ( @xmath13  gyr ) . for galaxies younger than    @xmath482  gyr , mostly at low - mass , the age gradient tends to be    anti - correlated with the @xmath15 parameter , with more    positive gradients at younger ages .
we have studied the correlation of color gradients in etgs with intrinsic galaxy properties , using an extensive sample , with excellent photometric and spectroscopic data over a broad wavelength baseline , and state - of - the - art analysis methods . however , even with such tools and data at our disposal , it remains difficult to gain substantive insight into the details of how galaxies actually form .
the diagnostic value of color gradients will only become fully apparent when model predictions become sufficiently specific to realize the full potential of the high quality observational data and methods developed to estimate color gradients .
the @xmath10-miles ssp models are constructed as described in cervantes et .
al .  ( 2007 ) , using both empirical and theoretical stellar libraries . the empirical libraries , like miles ( sanchez - blazquez et al .
2006 ) , contain spectra of stars in the solar neighborhood , but mostly lack bulge - stars , with non - solar abundance ratios .
hence , they do not allow a detailed spectral modeling of metal - rich , alpha - enhanced systems , such as bright etgs .
the @xmath10-miles models complement the empirical libraries , in the non - solar abundance regime , with the synthetic library of coelho et al .
( 2005 ) , consisting of high - resolution synthetic stellar spectra covering a wide range of stellar atmosphere s parameters .
the coelho et al .
( 2005 ) library covers both solar and alpha - enhanced mixtures in a wide baseline , from 3000  to 1.4  @xmath20 m , superseding previous versions by barbuy et al .
( 2003 ) , in the wavelength range 4600 - 5600  , and zwitter et al.(2004 ) , in the range 7653 - 8747  .
the resulting @xmath10-enhanced models consist of sed s covering the same spectral range ( @xmath87  ) , with the same spectral resolution ( 2.3  ) , as the ( solar abundance ) miles library .
the @xmath10-miles consists of @xmath483 ssps , corresponding to : twenty - six ages from 1 to 18  gyr ; five @xmath84 $ ] from @xmath484 to @xmath485 , and nine @xmath8 $ ] abundance ratios from @xmath85 to @xmath86 . from this set of models ,
we run starlight by extracting a sub - set of @xmath88 ssps  ( see sec .  [
sec : stellar_pop ] ) .    according to our tests ,
these preliminary alpha - enhanced models are clearly more efficient in fitting the etg s spectra @xmath7 to the solar - scale counterparts . for a subsample of @xmath486 etgs in the spider sample ,
we have compared the quality of the starlight spectral fitting when using either solar - abundance or @xmath10-miles ssps .
the fitting quality is measured , for each galaxy , by using : ( 1 ) the reduced @xmath50 of the fitting , @xmath487 , where @xmath488 is the number of @xmath489 values used in the fit minus the number of fitting parameters ; and ( 2 ) the percentage mean deviation , @xmath490 , over all the fitted pixels between the input and synthetic spectrum .
the @xmath491 is computed by taking the mean of @xmath492 , where @xmath493 and @xmath494 are the fluxes of the observed and synthetic spectrum at a given wavelength @xmath489 , over the spectral interval 4320 - 6800 @xmath77 .
we found that the reduced @xmath50 decreases by @xmath495 when using the alpha - enhanced models .
the improvement in fit quality is illustrated in fig .
[ fig : alphamiles ] .
left panel shows , as an example , the synthetic spectra obtained for a given etg , in a small spectral interval including the @xmath496 and @xmath497 features , when using either solar ( blue ) or @xmath10-miles ( red ) models . although both models well describe the @xmath498 , only the @xmath10-miles synthetic spectrum ( red ) is able to reproduce also the @xmath499 region .
right panel of fig .
[ fig : alphamiles ] compares the @xmath500 parameters between solar and alpha - enhanced synthetic spectra .
the @xmath10-miles models provide a mean percentage deviation smaller than that obtained from the solar models by a factor of @xmath501 .     as a further test , we compared the solar miles models with the @xmath10-miles models having @xmath8=0 $ ] ( i.e. , we compared the models which use the empirical stellar spectra with those using synthetic ones , in the regime where both models should give the same answer ) .
[ fig : miles_alpha_solar ] plots the distribution of luminosity - weighted @xmath8 $ ] , obtained by running starlight with a _ basis _ of @xmath10-miles ssps on different solar - miles ssp models ( see sec .  [
sec : stellar_pop ] ) .
we considered a total of @xmath502 solar models with a variety of ages ( in 21 steps from @xmath89 to @xmath503  gyr ) and metallicities ( @xmath84=-0.68 , -0.38 , 0 .
, 0.2 $ ] ) . for each solar model
, starlight was run with a _
basis _ of 220 @xmath10-miles ssp models , covering the same range in age and metallicity as for the analysis of sdss spectra ( sec .
[ sec : stellar_pop ] ) , and @xmath8=-0.2,0,+0.2,+0.4,+0.6 $ ] .
the distribution of luminosity - weighted @xmath8 $ ] in fig .
[ fig : miles_alpha_solar ] is sharply peaked around zero , with a width less than @xmath504 , proving the consistency of solar- and @xmath10 models for the case of solar abundance ratio .
since the @xmath243 s correlate with the ( optical ) @xmath371 ( see panel a of fig .  [ fig : grads_par ] ) , the fixed size of sdss spectra might affect the correlation of the @xmath314 s with @xmath15 , @xmath414 , and @xmath8 $ ] . to address this issue
, we show in fig .
[ fig : re_spar ] the median galaxy effective radius in different bins of @xmath38 , @xmath15 , @xmath414 , and @xmath8 $ ] , for the optical+nir sample of etgs .
red and black colors correspond to r- and k - band effective radii .
as expected , some correlations exist between the @xmath371 and the spectroscopic parameters . in particular , the effective radius increases in galaxies with larger metallicity and @xmath10-enhancement .
however , one can notice that the range of variation in @xmath371 amounts to only @xmath505  dex , i.e. much smaller than the range of @xmath506  dex spanned by the optical and nir effective radii ( see panel a of fig .  [
fig : grads_par ] ) . in the case of
@xmath8 $ ] ( panel d of fig .
[ fig : re_spar ] ) , the optical @xmath371 changes from @xmath507  dex at @xmath8 \sim 0 $ ] to @xmath508  dex at @xmath8 \sim 0.26 $ ] . from fig .
[ fig : grads_par ] , we see that the corresponding variation of @xmath243 is completely negligible , implying that the aperture effect is not affecting at all the correlations exhibited in fig .
[ fig : grads_spar ] .
we describe here how the colors available for the spider sample can be parametrized in terms of age and metallicity of stellar population models .
we adopt the  @xcite ( bc03 ) models .
[ sp_tau0.1 ] exhibits the magnitudes of a simple stellar population model , normalized to a total mass of one solar mass in stars , as a function of its age , @xmath197 , for the @xmath52 wavebands of the spider dataset .
the griz and yjhk magnitudes are given in the ab and vega systems , respectively . in order to describe the colors of etgs
, we consider relatively old ages , spanning the range of @xmath509 to @xmath510gyrs .
different metallicities are also displayed in the range of @xmath102 to @xmath511 times solar ( @xmath512 ) .
fluxes are computed with the bc03 code , convolving the sdss and ukidss throughput curves with the model seds . in the optical passbands ,
the magnitude is essentially a linear function of @xmath214 .
this is consistent with the fact that the flux of a simple stellar population is expected to change as @xmath513 , where @xmath10 depends on the metallicity of the stellar population and the slope of the imf  @xcite . in the nir passbands ,
the power - law approximation is less accurate , particularly at the lower age end . in order to calculate the color derivatives with respect to age and metallicity , for each waveband
we fitted the corresponding magnitudes with a two - dimensional polynomial in @xmath214 and @xmath514 .
as shown in fig .  [ sp_tau0.1 ] , a polynomial of degree eight reproduces model magnitudes very accurately .
the rms of the fits are smaller than @xmath515mag in all the bands . estimating fluxes using a composite stellar population with exponential star formation rate ( sfr ) and an e - folding time of 1  gyr as a function of age and metallicity provides essentially similar results . given the polynomial coefficients for each band , the computation of the color s derivatives is straightforward for any combination of @xmath197 and @xmath198 .
the existence of radial gradients of absorption indices in etg s spectra ( e.g. @xmath496 and @xmath516 ) implies that internal color gradients are likely driven by a variation of age and metallicity inside galaxies , consistent with our assumption in eq .
[ eq : grad_gx ] .
however , as argued by  @xcite and  @xcite , radial gradients in internal reddening might also contribute significantly to the observed color gradients .
in such case , one would naturally expect a correlation to exist between the gradient and the amount of dust , with stronger gradients in more dust - obscured galaxies .
although a detailed analysis of the dust distribution in etgs is certainly beyond the scope of the present paper , we can evaluate if internal reddening might affect significantly our findings on the correlation among gradients and stellar population properties ( sec .
[ sec : age_met_grads ] ) .
as a rough estimate of the _ total _ amount of internal reddening , we use the color excess , @xmath61 , obtained for each galaxy by the sed fitting procedure ( sec .
[ sec : cg_galpars ] ) .
[ fig : nablas_ebv ] plots the median @xmath243 for the different @xmath61 ( see tab .  1 ) . a clear correlation is detected , in the sense that steeper gradients are found at higher extinctions .
the trend is mostly because of galaxies at high @xmath61 ( @xmath517 ) , with these objects amounting to less than @xmath518 of the entire etg s sample .
we conclude that internal reddening might contribute significantly to color gradients only for a minor fraction of galaxies .
also , we find that selecting galaxies with @xmath519 , for which the variation of color gradients with internal reddening is insignificant , does not change at all the trends shown in fig .
[ fig : allgrads_pars ] .    another possible source of concern is that color derivatives in eq .
[ eq : grad_gx ] are estimated by stellar population models reshifted at the median redshift , @xmath258 , of the spider sample , hence neglecting the effect of k and evolutionary corrections on color gradients . in order to see
if this approximation impacts our results , we select only etgs from the optical+nir sample in a narrower redshift range of @xmath520 to @xmath521 , leading to a subsample of @xmath522 galaxies . for this subsample , the peaks of the @xmath243 , @xmath244 , and @xmath245
, distributions amount to about @xmath523 , @xmath524 , and @xmath525 , respectively , fully consistent with that obtained for the entire sample ( see tab .  [
tab : stat_cgrad_optnir ] ) . also , the trends shown in fig .
[ fig : allgrads_pars ] turned out not to be affected by this selection .

2005 , apj , 622 , 244" ," we present an analysis of stellar population gradients in 4,546 early - type galaxies ( etgs ) with photometry in @xmath0 along with optical spectroscopy . 
 etgs were selected as bulge - dominated systems , displaying passive spectra within the sdss fibers . 
 a new approach is described which utilizes color information to constrain age and metallicity gradients . defining an effective color gradient , @xmath1 , which incorporates all of the available color indices , 
 we investigate how @xmath1 varies with galaxy mass proxies , i.e. velocity dispersion , stellar ( @xmath2 ) and dynamical ( @xmath3 ) masses , as well as age , metallicity , and @xmath4 $ ] . 
 etgs with m@xmath5 larger than @xmath6 have increasing age gradients and decreasing metallicity gradients @xmath7 mass , metallicity , and enhancement . 
 we find that velocity dispersion and @xmath8 $ ] are the main drivers of these correlations . 
 etgs with @xmath9 , show no correlation of age , metallicity , and color gradients @xmath7 mass , although color gradients still correlate with stellar population parameters , and these correlations are independent of each other . in both mass regimes , 
 the striking anti - correlation between color gradient and @xmath10-enhancement is significant at @xmath11 5  @xmath12 , and results from the fact that metallicity gradient decreases with @xmath8 $ ] . 
 this anti - correlation may reflect the fact that star formation and metallicity enrichment are regulated by the interplay between the energy input from supernovae , and the temperature and pressure of the hot x - ray gas in etgs . for all mass ranges , 
 positive age gradients are associated with old galaxies ( @xmath13  gyr ) . for galaxies younger than @xmath14  gyr , mostly at low - mass 
 , the age gradient tends to be anti - correlated with the @xmath15 parameter , with more positive gradients at younger ages . "
"significant and aperiodic x - ray variation is one of the main characteristics of the active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .
however , origin of the agn x - ray variation has not been fully understood yet , in spite of extensive observational and theoretical studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in particular , many seyfert galaxies are known to exhibit an intriguing spectral variation in the iron k - energy band ( @xmath1 kev ) .
mcg-6 - 30 - 15 is a representative example ; its iron emission line profile seems to be broadened and skewed ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and fractional variation of the energy spectrum significantly drops at the iron line energy band @xcite . a possible scenario to explain these phenomena is the `` light - bending model '' . in this model
, the fluorescent iron line is emitted at the innermost part of the accretion disk , so that the line profile is broadened and skewed , and the disk - reflected photons are much less variable than the direct photons due to relativistic reverberation @xcite .
alternatively , the seemingly broad iron emission line feature may be interpreted due to iron k - edge feature caused by partial covering of the central x - ray source by intervening absorbers in the line of sight ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in this model , the apparent invariability of the iron energy band
is explained as due to such relatively higher variation of the continuum that is caused by change of the amounts of the absorption @xcite .
@xcite ( mei2012 hereafter ) proposed a `` variable partial covering ( vpc ) model '' , which is a sophistication of the latter idea . in this model , below @xmath010 kev , the original x - ray luminosity of the agn is not significantly variable , and the apparent x - ray variation is primarily caused by variation of the geometrical covering fraction of the extended x - ray source by the intervening clouds having internal ionization structures .
mei2012 applied the vpc model to suzaku observations of mcg-6 - 30 - 15 , and successfully explained not only the small fractional variation in the iron energy band , but also the spectral variations in 1  10 kev ( see also @xcite ) , besides an independent hard - tail variations above @xmath010 kev .
mizumoto , ebisawa & sameshima ( 2014 ) ( mes2014 hereafter ) has shown that the vpc model can also explain the soft x - ray spectral variations of the narrow seyfert 1 galaxy 1h0707405 observed with xmm and suzaku below @xmath010 kev .
therefore , it is interesting to examine if the vpc model is valid for other seyfert galaxies to explain the spectral variation below @xmath010 kev and the broad iron emission line feature . in the present paper ,
we explore the suzaku archive to select seyfert galaxies that show similar x - ray spectral characteristics to mcg-6 - 30 - 15 , and apply the vpc model to see if their x - ray spectral shapes and variations in 210 kev are explained by this model .

the xis is composed of four ccd cameras , xis0 to xis3 , each of which is located on the focal plane of the identical x - ray telescope module ( @xcite ) .
the xis is sensitive in 0.2  12.0  kev , and the field of view ( fov ) is 17@xmath78 @xmath8 17@xmath78 .
a half power diameter for the point - spread function is @xmath02@xmath9 .
the xis0 , 2 , and 3 have front - illuminated ( fi ) chips , and the xis1 has a back - illuminated ( bi ) one .
since the non - x - ray background ( nxb ) level of the fi ccds is significantly lower than that of the bi ccd in the iron k - band , we use only the fi ccds in the present study .
the entire xis2 and a part of the xis0 are dysfunctional since 2006 november and 2009 june , respectively , presumably due to micrometeorite hits .
the available xis fi cameras during each observation are shown in the last column of the observation log ( table [ t1 ] ) .
the hxd consists of two types of the detectors , pin and gso , achieving the combined sensitivity in 10  600  kev .
we use only pin in this study ( 10  60 kev ) , since our targets are not bright enough to make the gso spectral study feasible .
the pin has a fov of @xmath034@xmath9 square in fwhm .
we chose data from the suzaku public archive .
our main purpose is to study x - ray intensity and spectral variations of the seyfert galaxies that have similar spectral characteristics to mcg-6 - 30 - 15 , in particular in the iron k - energy band .
therefore , we selected only targets which are classified as seyfert galaxies , and known to show the seemingly broad iron k - line feature or a hint of that .
the unit of suzaku observations is an observation `` sequence '' , which is a single continuous pointing period , typically for a @xmath0day . for a given target ,
we combine the sequences carried out within a @xmath0month to define a new `` observation '' ( table [ t1 ] ) .
to study spectral variations efficiently , we chose only the observations which satisfy the following conditions ; ( 1 ) long enough total exposure time ( @xmath10 ksec ) for an observation , ( 2 ) bright enough that the total accumulate counts in an observation are more than 50,000 counts in 0.2  10 kev , and ( 3 ) the sources are variable more than 10% in 4  10 kev in an observation .
thus , we selected 27 observations for 25 targets ( using 50 sequences in total ) .
the observation log is shown in table  [ t1 ] .
we reprocessed all the data under the standard pipeline version 2.5 and used heasoft version 6.11 for data reduction . for the xis , we excluded events obtained during passages through the south atlantic anomaly ( saa ) and earth elevation angle @xmath11 for the day - time earth and @xmath12 for the night earth .
the source events were extracted from a 3@xmath9 radius circle centered on the source .
the background events were extracted from an annulus of 4@xmath96@xmath9 in radii when the source is located at the xis nominal position , or from a 3@xmath9 radius circle offset from the source avoiding the calibration sources at chip corners when the source is located at the hxd nominal position .
figure  [ f1 ] shows the 0.2  12.0  kev light curves by xis for all the 27 observations . as for the spectral analysis
, we used redistribution matrix functions ( rmfs ) and ancillary response files ( arfs ) , created by the ` xisrmfgen ` and ` xissimarfgen ` @xcite tools .
the three or two xis fi spectra and responses were combined .    for the hxd / pin ,
we exclude events obtained during passages through the saa and elevation angle from dark earth rim @xmath12 .
the pin background is composed of the nxb and cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) . we simulated background data for the spectral analysis .
the nxb spectrum was provided by the instrument team @xcite , while the cxb spectrum was simulated by convolving the heao-1 model @xcite with the detector response .
since we are primarily interested in the iron k - line band , we use only 2  10 kev of the xis data for spectral fitting , to avoid complexities in the softer ( @xmath13 2 kev ) energy band .
we also use the pin data in 10  40 kev , which help to constrain the underlying continuum to study iron k - band feature .
firstly , we analyze the time - averaged spectra of the 27 observations from the 25 sources .
we apply the same `` 3-component model '' proposed by mei2012 .
the model is represented as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the intrinsic cut - off power - law spectrum , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the direct power - law normalization and the absorbed power - law normalization , respectively .
@xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 represent the transmissions due to high - ionized warm absorber , low - ionized warm absorber , and partial heavy absorber ( @xmath21  @xmath22 ) , respectively .
each warm - absorber has two parameters , the hydrogen column - density , @xmath23 , and the ionization parameter , @xmath24 , such that @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , where @xmath28 means the energy - dependent photo - absorption cross - section at @xmath24 . @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the reflection albedo and the reflection normalization by the neutral accretion disk , respectively ( so that @xmath31 is the disk reflection component ) , and @xmath32 is a narrow iron k@xmath2 emission line .
the interstellar extinction is also included in the model fitting , but not explicitly shown in equation  ( [ eq1 ] ) .
we used the x - ray spectral fitting package xspec version 12.7.0 for the spectral analysis . for the interstellar absorption and the disk reflection , we adopted ` phabs ` and ` pexrav ` @xcite in xspec , respectively .
following mei2012 , the cut - off energy and the disk inclination angle are fixed at 160 kev and @xmath33 , respectively .
@xmath30 is linked to @xmath16 so that @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the solid - angle of the disk seen from the central source ; we confirmed that changing the inclination angle only slightly changes the best - fit spectral parameters within statistical errors . for the warm absorbers
, we use the table - grid model calculated by mei2012 using xstar ( version 2.1kn8 ) , where redshift was fixed at 0.001 .    in the following
, we set the acceptance criterion of the successful model fitting as the reduced @xmath36 .
the 4 sources did not satisfy the criterion ; ngc1365 ( reduced @xmath37 ) , ngc3227 ( 1.23 ) , ngc4151 ( 1.24 ) , and centaurusa ( 1.42 ) .
3c111 satisfied the fitting criterion ( reduced @xmath38 ) , but the heavily absorbed component ( @xmath39 ) was not required .
since the heavily absorbed component is the most important player in our vpc model to produce the broad iron line feature and the spectral variation below @xmath010 kev , we drop 3c111 from further study .
consequently , 22 observations out of 20 sources are successfully represented with the 3-component model ( figure  [ f2 ] ) , and used for further study .
the best - fit parameters of the 22 time - averaged spectra are summarized in table  [ t2 ] .    in the case of mcg-6 - 30 - 15 ,
all the high - ionized absorber ( @xmath18 ) , low - ionized absorber ( @xmath19 ) , and the heavy absorber ( @xmath20 ) were required ( mei2012 ) .
however , we found the three absorbers are not always necessary . in fact , only one of the 22 spectra requires all the three absorbers ( we call it as group a ) .
in addition to the heavy absorber , 7 spectra require only the high - ionized absorber ( group b ) , and one requires only the low - ionized absorber ( group c ) .
13 require none besides the heavy absorber ( group d ) .
we accept these differences as diversity of the seyfert galaxies , for the time being , being not able to find an obvious reason to explain the difference . our model for group
a , b , c and d are illustrated in figure [ figabcd ] .
next , we study spectral variations during each of the 22 observations ( out of 20 sources ) , the average spectra of which were successfully fitted by the 3-component model .
we examine if the vpc model proposed by mei2012 may explain the observed spectral variations or not .      to prepare ,
we briefly review the vpc model in the following : let s define the `` total normalization '' , @xmath40 , and the partial covering fraction , @xmath2 , so that @xmath41 and @xmath42 here , we consider such a situation that the total normalization , @xmath40 , represents the intrinsic agn luminosity , and the x - ray source having a finite size is partially covered by fragmented heavy absorbing clouds ( with the absorption @xmath43 ) , where the geometrical partial covering fraction is @xmath2 .
detailed study of spectral variations of mcg-6 - 30 - 15 by mei2012 revealed , surprisingly , that the low - ionized warm absorption @xmath44 is related to the same partial covering fraction @xmath2 , such that    @xmath45    where @xmath46 is the common amount of the column density of the low - ionized absorber while the spectra vary .
this relation was unexpected , since the low - ionized absorption @xmath47 and the partial covering fraction due to @xmath43 should be in principle independent ( see equation  [ eq1 ] ) .
mei2012 interpreted this relation as that the low - ionized absorber ( @xmath47 ) and the heavy absorber ( @xmath43 ) are parts of the same absorbing clouds ( figure [ figabcd ] ) , so that the `` double partial covering '' with the same covering fraction is presumably the case ( mes2014 ) .
consequently , the 3-component model ( [ eq1 ] ) is rewritten as @xmath48 @xmath49 @xmath50 mei2012 applied this model to the eight intensity - sliced spectra of mcg-6 - 30 - 15 observed with suzaku , where the good - time intervals ( gtis ) are determined using xis below 10 kev .
@xmath51 is assumed to be invariable , and fixed to be 0.3 times the average of @xmath52 .
the iron line parameters are also fixed to those obtained from the time - averaged spectra .
these spectra were explained well in 1  40 kev by only variation of @xmath2 , whereas @xmath40 is invariable besides the brightest one ( where @xmath40 is 1.5 times greater ) ; all the other spectral parameters are invariable ( = common to all the variable spectra ) .
following mei2012 , we create the intensity - sliced spectra based on the xis flux , and examine the vpc model ( [ eq8 ] ) . for each observation , we define four intensity ranges in the 0.2  12.0  kev light curve so that the photon counts for each intensity range be approximately equal , and create the four intensity - sliced energy spectra .
the red dotted horizontal lines in figure  [ f1 ] indicate the intensity boundaries for each observation .
we try to fit the four intensity - sliced spectra in 2  40 kev simultaneously with the model ( [ eq8 ] ) only making @xmath2 variable . if necessary , @xmath40 is varied in addition .
other parameters are common to all the four spectra , and the best - fit values are determined from the model fitting ( table [ t3 ] ) . as a result ,
we successfully fitted the intensity - sliced spectra of the 20 observations of 18 sources only varying @xmath2 .
the rest two sources ( markarian766 and ngc5548 ) require @xmath40 to be slightly variable : markarian766 requires @xmath40 for the brightest spectrum to be @xmath01.3 times greater than the rest . ngc5548 requires the @xmath40 for the brighter two spectra to be @xmath01.7 times higher than the dimmer two .
we summarize the spectral fitting results with the vpc model for the 22 intensity - sliced spectra in figure  [ f3 ] and table  [ t3 ] .
next , we see if time sequences of the soft x - ray energy spectra are also explained by the vpc model with the time - varying partial covering fractions . in the xis light - curves ,
we define boundaries of the time - sliced spectra every @xmath53  sec , which corresponds to four suzaku orbital periods .
the blue vertical dotted lines in figure  [ f1 ] show the time - boundaries for each observation , and we made energy spectra from each time bin .
numbers of the time - sliced spectra in a single observation are from 6 ( 4c 74.26 ) to 28 ( ngc 4051 ) . for each observation ,
a time - series of the xis and pin spectra are fitted simultaneously with the vpc model in equation ( [ eq8 ] ) , while spectral variation above 10 kev is hardly constrained , because the photon statistic is not sufficient .
we first try to fit the spectra only allowing the partial covering fraction @xmath2 to vary .
if not successful ( i.e. , @xmath54 ) , the total normalization @xmath40 is varied in addition .    as a result , we found that the xis spectral variations are explained only varying @xmath2 for 21 observations from 19 sources .
figure  [ f4 ] shows variation of the observed counting rates in 0.2  12 kev and the partial covering fraction for each of the 21 observations .
anti - correlation between the counting rate and the partial covering fraction is obvious .
namely , apparent soft x - ray flux and spectral variations below @xmath010 kev are primarily caused by variation of the partial covering fraction .
only the remaining source , ngc5548 , needs varying the total normalization @xmath40 in addition to @xmath2 within a single observation .
figure  [ f5 ] shows variation of the counting rates and partial covering fraction for ngc5548 .
note that observation of ngc5548 spans more than @xmath55 sec , which is the longest in our samples , and the total normalization @xmath40 is still invariable within time - scales less than several @xmath56 sec .
this suggests that the intrinsic luminosity variation of seyfert galaxies has a timescale longer than @xmath57 sec .
in order to study variation in the iron line energy band , we calculate the root mean square ( rms ) spectra for the 22 observations .
we use the same time - series of the spectra used in the previous section .
namely , rms spectra are calculated with a bin - width of @xmath53  sec .    for a time - series of @xmath58 , where @xmath59 are background - subtracted counting rates , @xmath60 are their errors , and @xmath40 is number of the time - bins , the rms variability is given as @xmath61 where @xmath62 , and the error is @xmath63 ( edelson et al .
2002 ) . for each observation , we computed the rms variability for 15 energy band with equation  ( [ eq9 ] ) to constitute the rms spectrum .
we used only the xis data in 2  10  kev to focus the iron line energy band .
the 22 rms spectra are shown in figure  [ f6 ] ( in black ) .    since each time - sliced spectrum
is fitted successfully with the vpc model , the rms model spectra can be calculated from the best - fit vpc model spectra .
these model rms spectra are also shown in figure  [ f6 ] ( in red ) .
we find that the observed rms spectra and the model rms spectra agree well , and both tend to show drops at the iron line energy band ( 6  7 kev ) .
the reason for that is discussed in section [ rmsdiscussion ] .
we have seen that the variable partial covering ( vpc ) model , which has been proposed for mcg-6 - 30 - 15 ( mei2012 ) and 1h0707495 ( mes2014 ) , can explain the 210 kev spectral variation of 20 other seyfert galaxies observed with suzaku .
the original vpc model for mcg-6 - 30 - 15 requires three types of the absorbers ; optically - thick partial absorbing clouds , optically - thin envelopes of the clouds , and a uniformly surrounding highly ionized absorber ( group a in figure [ figabcd ] ) .
1h0707495 does not require the highly ionized absorber ( group c in figure [ figabcd ] ; mes2014 ) , and the 20 targets studied in this paper are grouped into four depending on the number and types of the absorbers required ( figure [ figabcd ] ) . the optically - thick partial absorbers are always required , where the hydrogen - column densities are @xmath64 @xmath22 and the partial covering fraction is variable from @xmath00.1 to @xmath65 ( table [ t3 ] ) .    the heavily absorbed spectral components by such optically - thick absorbing clouds exhibit strong iron k - edge , which , together with the distant reflection feature ( narrow iron emission line and weak iron k - edge ) , can explain the observed spectral feature in the iron k - band ( figure [ f2 ] ) . because such thick absorbers are completely opaque at @xmath02 kev ( figure [ f2 ] ) , variation of the partial covering fraction can cause significant soft x - ray flux variations even if the intrinsic x - ray luminosity is invariable .
in fact , the observed flux and spectral variations below @xmath66 kev within a time scale of @xmath67 day are explained by only variation of the partial covering fraction , while the intrinsic luminosity below @xmath010 kev is assumed to be constant ( figures [ f3 ] and [ f4 ] ) .
it is well - known that fractional variation at the broad iron line - like feature in mcg-6 - 30 - 15 is significantly reduced ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . in the vpc model
when the total normalization ( intrinsic luminosity ) is invariable , change of the partial covering fraction causes _ anti - correlation _ between the direct ( uncovered ) spectral component and the absorbed ( covered ) spectral component below @xmath010 kev ( figure [ f3 ] ) .
thus , flux variations of the direct component and the absorbed component _ cancel each other_. the fluxes from these components are the closest where the absorbing material is most transparent , just below the iron edge at @xmath07.1 kev .
consequently , the cancellation of the two spectral components works most effectively at around @xmath05.57 kev , and the fractional variation is reduced ( figure [ f6 ] ; see also @xcite and mei2012 ) .
also , the @xmath06.4 kev iron emission line is not expect to vary with the continuum , as it is emitted from outer parts of the accretion disk .
these effects work together to reduce the fractional variation at around the iron energy band . among the datasets used in this paper , span of the ngc5548 observation
is the longest , for @xmath050 days .
its soft x - ray luminosity _ does _ vary , by a factor of two over @xmath68 sec , while the covering fraction varies more significantly at much shorter timescales ( figure [ f5 ] ) .
presumably , soft x - ray flux variation of seyfert galaxies have two different origins with different timescales ; intrinsic luminosity variation over @xmath0days and variation of the partial covering fraction below a timescale of @xmath0day ( see also mes2014 ) .      we could fit the variable spectra in 2  10 kev only varying the partial covering fraction ( figures [ f3 ] and [ f4 ] ) . when the same gtis determined based on the xis counting rates below 10 kev
are used for pin in 10  40 kev , we see some , but not very significant , residuals above @xmath010 kev ( figure [ f3 ] ) ; this was also the case for mcg-6 - 30 - 15 ( mei2012 ) .
note , in the vpc model , variation of @xmath2 hardly affects the spectral variation above @xmath010 kev , where effect of the photo - absorption is minimum .
namely , if the hard - tail variations above @xmath010 kev were correlated with the intensities below @xmath010 kev , we would have seen much more significant systematic discrepancies above @xmath010kev .
thus , the current results suggest that the hard - tails above @xmath010 kev are rather independently variable and averaged when sorted by the intensities below @xmath0 10 kev .
in fact , presence of such independently variable hard components above @xmath010 kev is confirmed through completely different approach in mcg-6 - 30 - 15 ( noda et al .
2011 ) and ngc3516 ( noda et al .  2013 ) . for 1h0707495
, the vpc model almost perfectly represents the flux variation in 0.5  1 kev in timescales within @xmath0day , while less satisfactorily in higher energies ( mes2014 ) ; this also suggests the commonness of the independently variable hard component in seyfert galaxies . in summary
, we propose that observed x - ray flux / spectral variation of seyfert galaxies is explained by variation of the partial covering fraction in timescales below @xmath0day and the intrinsic soft x - ray luminosity variation over @xmath68 sec , both of which are mainly responsible for @xmath6710 kev , and independent hard x - ray variations above @xmath010 kev .      from the observed timescales of the x - ray spectral variation and the ionization condition , mei2012 estimated sizes and locations of the partial absorbing clouds , and proposed that the partial covering clouds in the vpc model are the broad line region ( blr ) clouds .
we revisit this model assuming the blr parameters estimated from optical observations .
we assume the following typical blr parameters ; size of blr , @xmath69 cm , blr cloud size , @xmath70 cm , and a blr cloud velocity , @xmath71 cm s@xmath72 ( petterson 2006 ) .    first , the absorbing clouds should be optically thick at the iron k - edge , such that @xmath73 @xmath22 , and @xmath74 ( table [ t2 ] ) .
ionization parameter of a blr cloud may be estimated as follows ; @xmath75 thus the assumption of the optical - thickness is valid .
next , we estimate the x - ray emission region size and the variation timescale .
we do not see either full - covering nor the no - covering , and a typical covering fraction is @xmath76 ( figure [ f4 ] ) .
thus , if we take the x - ray emission region size @xmath77 , @xmath78 , namely @xmath79 . if normalized by the schwarzschild radius , @xmath80 cm , @xmath81 . presumably , this is reasonable as an x - ray emitting corona surrounding the central black hole .
also , typical flux variation timescale due to passage of a blr cloud may be estimated as @xmath82 sec , which agrees with observations ( figure [ f4 ] ) .
we notice that , in mcg-6 - 30 - 15 and the 20 seyfert galaxies analyzed in this paper , such moderate 6.4 kev emission lines with typical equivalent - widths of @xmath83 ev are observed , that are consistent with the fluorescence from the distant cold reflectors with @xmath84 which we assumed .
if the central x - ray sources are almost fully surrounded by thick and cold absorbers in these agns , much stronger fluorescent lines would have been observed ( e.g. , reynolds et al .
thus , the weakness of the observed fluorescent emission line suggests that the partial absorbing materials are directional and/or localized , occupying a much smaller solid angle than @xmath85 .
it has been pointed out by theoretical simulations that accretion disks in agns tend to have disk winds or outflows , which imprints a variety of spectroscopic signatures including absorption lines and edges in the x - ray / uv spectra ( e.g. , proga and kallman 2004 , sim et al .
2010 , nomura et al .
so , the partial covering clouds may be a part of such fragmented and directional disk winds or outflows .
furthermore , doppler motion of the outflowing clouds will smear the narrow emission line features , which would make the fluorescent lines less noticeable .    according to the simulation by nomura et al .
( 2013 ) , where condition of the broad absorption line ( bal ) quasars is studied , the broad iron k - absorption lines due to very fast outflow ( @xmath86 km s@xmath72 ) of low - ionized material ( @xmath74 ) are observed only in a narrow range of the viewing angle between @xmath87 and @xmath88 . when the viewing angle is larger ( closer to edge - on )
, the bal will not be produced , as the outflow gas will be too thick ( @xmath89 @xmath22 ) and the velocity will be too low .
these conditions are , however , rather suitable for the optically - thick partial absorbing clouds , which are required in our vpc model .
thus , the seyfert galaxies observed through the optically - thick partial absorbers may be the outflowing agns seen close to edge - on .
in fact , such agn outflow gas might be origin of the blr clouds ( patterson 2006 ) .
our vpc model explains the observed broad and unvarying iron line features from seyfert galaxies in terms of fluctuation of the partial absorbers in the line of sight .
an alternative model which might explain the broad and unvarying iron line features is the `` relativistic disk - line model '' ( fabian et al .
2014 and references therein ) , where the fluorescent iron lines are supposed to be emitted from the innermost region of the illuminated accretion disk , significantly skewed and broadened by strong relativistic effects . in this scenario ,
suppression of the iron line variability is explained by relativistic `` light - bending effect '' ( miniutti & fabian 2004 ) , where the disk - reflected photons are less variable than the direct photons from the illuminating source , while the height of a point - like illuminating source above the accretion disk varies .
whereas the light - bending model qualitatively explains the invariability of the broad iron emission line , it does not seem to explain the observed spectral variations quantitatively ( see , e.g. , goosmann et al .
2006 , niedwiecki and miyakawa 2010 , ycki et al .
2010 , gallo et al .
the most significant parameter to cause observable spectral changes in the light - bending model is the height of the point - like source above the accretion disk . so that the light - bending model to remain compelling
, it should explain quantitatively the observed spectral variations ( figures [ f3 ] and [ f4 ] ) , as well as the rms spectra ( figure [ f6 ] ) by only change of the source height above the disk .
presumably , a critical point of the relativistic disk - line model is its extreme concentration of the disk - reflected emission within the innermost region where the relativistic effects are the strongest .
for instance , in extreme cases , a prediction was made based on the disk - line model that much of the x - ray emission should originate from within only a few gravitational radii ( e.g. , fabian and vaughan 2003 , fabian et al .
if this is the case , since the agn is surrounded by many absorbing clouds far outside , when an absorber greater than the x - ray emission region size moves across the line - of - sight , we shall see an abrupt _ total _ eclipse , but never a gradual _ partial _ eclipse .
however , observational evidences are being accumulated for seyfert galaxies that the extended x - ray sources are partially and progressively obscured by intervening absorbers with comparable sizes ( e.g. , mckerna & yaqoob 1998 , maiolino et al .
2010 , sanfrutos , m.  2013 , kaastra et al .
2014 , marinucci et al .
2014 , beuchert et al .  2015 ) . in an occultation event
identified in mcg-6 - 30 - 15 , the partial covering fraction varied gradually by 0.32 within @xmath020 ksec by a blr cloud far outside ( marinucci et al .
this strongly suggests that the x - ray source is more extended than the absorber , contrary to the assumption of the relativistic disk - line model .
more unambiguous constraint of the x - ray emission region size may come from the x - ray micro - lensing observations .
chartas et al .
( 2012 ) observed progressive profile changes of the fluorescent iron emission lines from the gravitationally
lensed quasar rx j11311231 , when the caustic passes over the inner accretion disk .
the lines are distorted by general relativistic and doppler effects , and the line emitting radius is directly measured from these effects as @xmath015 times the gravitational radius .
mosquera et al .
( 2013 ) directly measured the x - ray emission region size of q2237 + 0305 ; the half - light radius of the hard x - ray ( 3.5  21.5 kev ) is @xmath90 cm , which is an order of magnitude smaller than that of the optical emission , and marginally smaller than that of the soft x - ray emission ( 1.1  3.5 kev ) .
it is particularly of interest that the _ lower - limit _ of the x - ray emission region size is directly constrained . taking the black hole mass estimates as @xmath91 ( morgan et al .
2010 ) or 2.4@xmath92 ( assef et al .  2011 ) , hard x - ray emission region size ( half - light radius ) is constrained as @xmath93 or @xmath94 times the gravitational radius , respectively .
these micro - lensing results are consistent with the partial covering scenario that x - ray emission region is extended as much as a few tens of the gravitational radius and comparable in size with the partial absorbing clouds in the line - of - sight . so that the relativistic reflection scenario works , the innermost disk region has to be sufficiently illuminated , and at least a part of the x - ray emitting corona should lie within about 10 gravitational radii ( fabian et al .
future micro - lensing observations are expected to constrain the lower - limit of the x - ray emission region size more tightly , and tell if the relativistic disk - line scenario is truly feasible or not .
in this paper , we have studied origin of the soft x - ray spectral variation and broad iron line feature commonly observed in seyfert galaxies .
we have applied the variable partial covering ( vpc ) model , which was originally proposed for mcg-6 - 30 - 15 ( @xcite ) and has been shown to be successful to 1h0707495 as well @xcite , to 20 other seyfert galaxies observed with suzaku . in the vpc model , most spectral variations below @xmath010 kev in a timescale within @xmath0day are explained by variation of the partial covering fraction of the extended x - ray source due to fluctuations of the optically - thick absorbing clouds in the line of sight .
not only the broad iron line features , but also the 2  10 kev spectral variations are successfully explained by the vpc model . we conclude that observed x - ray flux / spectral variation of seyfert galaxies is explained by variation of the partial covering fraction in timescales below @xmath0day and the intrinsic soft x - ray luminosity variation over @xmath68 sec , both of which are mainly responsible for @xmath6710 kev , and independent hard x - ray variations above @xmath010 kev .

 , the absorbed spectral component through the optically - thick absorbing clouds has a significant iron k - edge , which primarily accounts for the observed seemingly broad iron line feature . 
 fluctuation of the absorbing clouds in the line of sight of the extended x - ray source results in variation of the partial covering fraction , which causes an anti - correlation between the direct ( not covered ) spectral component and the absorbed ( covered ) spectral component below @xmath010 kev . observed spectral variation in 210 kev in a timescale of less than @xmath0day is primarily explained by such variations of the partial covering fraction , while the intrinsic soft x - ray luminosity is hardly variable . "
"the internal antarctic plateau is , at present , a site of potential great interest for astronomical applications .
the extreme low temperatures , the dryness , the typical high altitude of the internal antarctic plateau ( more than 2500 m ) , joint to the fact that the optical turbulence seems to be concentrated in a thin surface layer whose thickness is of the order of a few tens of meters do of this site a place in which , potentially , we could achieve astronomical observations otherwise possible only by space .    in spite of the exciting first results ( see refs .  , , ) the uncertainties on the effective gain that astronomers might achieve from ground - based astronomical observation from this location still suffers from serious uncertainties and doubts that have been pointed out in previous work ( see refs .  , , ) .
a better estimate of the properties of the optical turbulence above the internal antarctic plateau can be achieved with both dedicated measurements done in simultaneous ways with different instruments and simulations provided by atmospheric models .
simulations offer the advantage to provide volumetric maps of the optical turbulence ( @xmath0 ) extended on the whole internal plateau and , ideally , to retrieve comparative estimates in a relative short time and homogeneous way on different places of the plateau . in a previous paper@xcite
our group performed a detailed analysis of the meteorological parameters from which the optical turbulence depends on , provided by the general circulation model ( gcm ) of the european center for medium - range weather forecasts ( ecmwf ) . in that work we quantified the accuracy of the ecmwf estimates of all the major meteorological parameters and , at the same time , we pointed out which are the limitations of the general circulation models . in contexts in which the gcms fail , mesoscale models can supply more information .
the latter are indeed conceived to reconstruct phenomena ( such as the optical turbulence ) that develop at a too small spatial and temporal scale to be described by a gcm . in spite of the fact that mesoscale models can attain higher resolution than the gcm , thes
parameters such as the optical turbulence are not explicitly resolved but are parameterized , i.e. the fluctuations of the microscopic physical quantities are expressed as a function of the corresponding macroscopic quantities averaged on a larger spatial scale ( cell of the model ) . for classical meteorological parameters the use of a mesoscale model should be useless if gcms such as the one of the ecmwf could provide estimate with equivalent level of accuracy .
for this reason the hagelin et al paper@xcite has been a first step towards the exploitation of the mesoscale meso - nh model .
we retrieved all what it was possible from the ecmwf analyses and we defined their limitations at the same time .
we concluded that in the first 10 - 20 m , the ecmwf analyses show a discrepancy with respect to measurements of the order of 2 - 3 m.s@xmath1 for the wind speed and of 4 - 5 k for the temperature .
preliminary tests concerning the optimization of the model configuration and sensitivity to the horizontal and the vertical resolution with the meso - nh model have already been conducted by our team for the internal antarctic plateau . in this paper
we present further progress of that work .
more precisely , we intend :    * to compare the performances of the mesoscale meso - nh model and the ecmwf general circulation model in reconstructing wind speed and absolute temperature ( main meteorological parameters from which the optical turbulence depends on ) with respect to the measurements .
this analysis will quantify the performances of the meso - nh model with respect to the gcm from the ecmwf . * to perform simulations of the optical turbulence above dome c employing different model configurations and compare the typical simulated thickness of the surface layer with the one measured by trinquet et al  @xcite  . in this way we aim to establish which configuration
is necessary to reconstruct correctly the @xmath0 .    [ cols='^ ' , ]     the three nights presented here exhibit different turbulent conditions .
they show the ability of the model to react and predict the evolution of different surface layers . during the first night ( 2005
july 11 ) the surface layer is constant in time , with a mean forecasted thickness of  82 m ( with the grid - nested simulation , fig .
[ fig : ot]b ) .
the observation for this night@xcite gave a value of 98 m at 14:10 utc . the second night ( 2005 july 25 )
has a forecasted mean surface layer height lower ( with the grid - nested simulation , fig .
[ fig : ot]d ) : 17 m. the observed value was 22 m at 13:53 utc .
the third and last night displayed ( 2005 august 29 ) has a forecasted mean surface layer height of  97 m ( always with the grid - nested simulation , [ fig : ot]f ) .
the observed value for this night was 47 m at 14:47 utc .    in two of these three nights , the thickness of the surface layer retrieved by the model is well correlated with the observed one .
one can notice that for these two nights , the monomodel simulations give higher values than the grid - nested simulations .
the third night shows some interesting variability of the surface layer height , which are not present in the other nights and that is a signature of an evident temporal evolution of the turbulent energy distribution even in conditions of a pretty stratified atmosphere . for this night
meso - nh gives a thickness for the surface layer of around 97 m instead of the observed one ( 47 m ) .
in this paper we studied the performances of a mesoscale meteorological model , meso - nh , in reconstructing wind and temperature vertical profiles above concordia station , a site in the internal antarctic plateau .
two different configurations were tested : monomodel low horizontal resolution , and grid - nesting high horizontal resolution .
the results were compared to the ecmwf general circulation model and radiosoundings .
* we showed that near the surface , meso - nh retrieved better the wind vertical gradient than the ecmwf analyses , thanks to the use of a highest vertical resolution .
more over , the analysis of the first vertical grid point permits us to conclude that , as is , the meso - nh model surface temperature is closest to the observations than the ecmwf general circulation model which is too warm . * the outputs from the grid - nested simulations are closer to the observations than the monomodel simulations .
this study highlighted the necessity of the use of high horizontal resolution to reconstruct a good meteorological field in antarctica , even if the orography is almost flat over the internal antarctica plateau .
the computations estimates from a previous study@xcite are probably affected by the low horizontal resolution they used in their simulations .
* for what concerns the optical turbulence , both configurations predict a mean surface layer height higher than in the observations . however , it is always inferior at 100 m ( when we used the criterion [ eq : bl1 ] of trinquet et al@xcite  ) .
the configuration of meso - nh giving better estimate ( closer to observations ) is in grid - nesting mode . *
the results of meso - nh concerning the computation of the mean thickness of the surface layer are not very dependent of the time interval used to average it .
this widely simplifies the analysis of simulations . *
the criterion used in trinquet et al@xcite appears to be misleading .
indeed , it underestimates the typical thickness of the turbulent surface layer .
we propose the use of another critera ( presented in the last section of the paper ) instead .
it gives a mean value higher of around 15 m for the eleven nights .
this result has an important implication for astronomical application .
it is indeed not so realistic to envisage a telescope placed above a tower of more than 50 m and the use of the adaptive optics remains the unique path to follow to envisage astronomical facilities at dome c.      in this paper we did not present results concerning the seeing .
we will focus our work ahead on this parameter , discriminating between two different partial contributions : the seeing in the free atmosphere , and the seeing of the surface layer .
we plan to make comparisons between meso - nh output and observations .

1190 - 1197 , 2006 ." ," mesoscale model such as meso - nh have proven to be highly reliable in reproducing 3d maps of optical turbulence ( see refs .  ,  ,  ,  ) above mid - latitude astronomical sites . 
 these last years ground - based astronomy has been looking towards antarctica . 
 especially its summits and the internal continental plateau where the optical turbulence appears to be confined in a shallow layer close to the icy surface . 
 preliminary measurements have so far indicated pretty good value for the seeing above 30 - 35 m : 0.36 `` ( see ref .  ) and 0.27 '' ( see refs .  , ) at dome 
 c. site testing campaigns are however extremely expensive , instruments provide only local measurements and atmospheric modelling might represent a step ahead towards the search and selection of astronomical sites thanks to the possibility to reconstruct 3d @xmath0 maps over a surface of several kilometers . 
 the antarctic plateau represents therefore an important benchmark test to evaluate the possibility to discriminate sites on the same plateau . 
 our group  @xcite has proven that the analyses from the ecmwf global model do not describe with the required accuracy the antarctic boundary and surface layer in the plateau 
 . a better description could be obtained with a mesoscale meteorological model . in this contribution 
 we present the progress status report of numerical simulations ( including the optical turbulence - @xmath0 ) obtained with meso - nh above the internal antarctic plateau . among the topic 
 attacked : the influence of different configurations of the model ( low and high horizontal resolution ) , use of the grid - nesting interactive technique , forecasting of the optical turbulence during some winter nights . "
"the baryon asymmetry of the universe remains a mystery .
many ideas have been formulated in the literature , yet much uncertainty remains as to how the baryon asymmetry could arise .
it is not even clear at what scale the initial asymmetry is produced .
the sakharov conditions for baryogenesis are baryon number violation , @xmath5 and @xmath6 violation , and a departure from equilibrium .
the standard model ( sm ) does not exhibit these conditions at nearly the strength required to produce the observed asymmetry given our standard cosmological assumptions , and thus it is expected that we must go beyond the sm in order to explain the asymmetry .    the last sakharov condition , departure from equilibrium , implies the necessity of a strong first - order phase transition . since we know that the electroweak symmetry must be broken it is tempting to assume that the corresponding phase transition can satisfy this condition . as noted above , the sm is inadequate , but how far beyond the sm must one go to find the necessary out of equilibrium dynamics ?
this question has been addressed by a number of authors ( e.g. , see  @xcite for studies of the dynamics of the electroweak phase transition in various recent models ) . in ref .  @xcite it was shown that if the higgs potential is augmented merely by a @xmath7 operator , it can generate a strong first - order electroweak phase transition .
as one can intuit , the scale suppressing this non - renormalizable operator must be in the neighborhood of the electroweak scale in order to generate a substantive effect on the phase transition dynamics .
a tree - level analysis of this theory was conducted in  @xcite , with some further refinements in  @xcite , and it was concluded that a strong first order phase transition is possible even with a higgs boson as massive as 200  gev . of course , for the presence of this @xmath7 operator to be compatible with electroweak ( ew ) precision data , a higher scale should suppress other dimension six operators , in particular those leading to oblique corrections .
the analysis of  @xcite shows that the low energy effective theories of strongly interacting models , where a light composite higgs emerges as a pseudo - goldstone boson , have precisely this structure and single out @xmath7 as one of the dominant dimension six operators   operator since it is the only one that affects the shape of the potential at tree - level , and thus it has significant effects on the dynamics of the phase transition as we shall see . ] , being suppressed by the decay constant of the strong sector , parametrically lighter than the cutoff scale of the model . for a fixed value of the strong decay constant ,
the compatibility with precision ew data is ensured by pushing the masses of vector resonances above 2.5  tev  @xcite . in that case
a decay constant as low as 300  gev would be compatible with precision measurements .
our analysis should also apply to study the dynamics of electroweak symmetry breaking in little higgs models , and to the more general cases where the @xmath7 operator is generated by integrating out a heavy massive scalar field .
however , some extra fine - tunings might be needed in that case to evade ew precision data .    in this publication
we extend the results of  @xcite in several ways .
first , we re - analyze the theory using the full finite temperature effective ( nonrenormalizable ) higgs potential at one - loop .
second , we study the nucleation of broken phase bubbles and consider the effects of supercooling on the electroweak phase transition ( ewpt ) within this more complete analysis .
this is an important dynamical consideration of the phase transition that can in principle have dramatic consequences to when ( and if ) the phase transition happens .
finally , we investigate whether or not the gravitational waves emitted at the nucleation time can be detected by present and future interferometry experiments , which would provide another way to study the origin of ew symmetry breaking and another way to test the composite nature of the higgs .
we consider each of these points in the following three sections , and then make some concluding remarks .
once non - renormalizable interactions are allowed in the theory , as in our case , complete renormalization requires that the infinite set of higher - order operators be considered . however , one is able to truncate the list of needed operators in a perturbative expansion of the inverse cutoff scale . to study the effect of new physics on the higgs potential in this effective field theory context , it is sufficient to work at the order @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the cutoff scale suppressing the effective operators .
higher dimensional operators will be sufficiently irrelevant to our problem and can be ignored .
our analysis is focussed on operators that affect the higgs self - interactions .
these effective interactions parametrize the new physics responsible for ew symmetry breaking that become fully dynamical at about the scale @xmath9 .
thus they can be used to generically constrain beyond - the - sm physics affecting the higgs sector . though ew precision measurements put severe constraints on the set of operators affecting the weak bosons polarization tensors ,
the effective higgs self - interactions are almost completely free parameters since the higgs sector has not yet been probed directly by experiment .
thus the scale suppressing the operator @xmath7 we will focus on can be significantly lower than the cutoff scale of the ( strongly coupled ) model .
this is in particular the case of composite higgs models when the higgs emerges from a strongly - interacting sector as a light pseudo - goldstone boson  @xcite .
the scale suppressing the @xmath7 operator is then @xmath10 , the decay constant of the strong sector , a quantity 4@xmath11 smaller that the cutoff scale .
we start with the following classical effective potential for the sm higgs @xcite : @xmath12 where @xmath13 which develops a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) equal to @xmath14 .
@xmath15 is identified at tree level with the decay constant of the strong sector 
the details of this identification at one - loop are described later .
we choose a vacuum configuration where only the real part of the neutral component has a constant background value : @xmath16 .
the physical higgs boson is @xmath17 , and we use the traditional background field method  @xcite to evaluate the quantum potential for @xmath18 at one - loop .
we focus on the main relevant contributions coming from the @xmath19 gauge bosons , the top quark , and the higgs and goldstone scalars .
as we briefly review in appendix  [ app : review_technics ] , the quantum potential for the background value up to one - loop order at finite temperature in the landau gauge ( where ghosts decouple ) is @xmath20 with @xmath21 \label{eqn : fullv1eff}\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the euclidean loop 4-momentum , @xmath23 are the matsubara frequencies in the imaginary time formalism , where @xmath24 for bosons ( periodic on the euclidean time circle ) and @xmath25 for fermions ( anti - periodic on the euclidean time circle ) .
the numbers of degrees of freedom for the relevant fields are @xmath26 .
we include the fermion - loop minus sign in the definition of @xmath27 .
note that in the landau gauge one must count all three degrees of freedom of each massive vector boson _ and _ the one degree of freedom of each goldstone scalar .
this may be qualitatively understood be recalling that the @xmath28 goldstone fields are independent quantum fluctuations away from the zero - temperature minimum .
we present a quantitative argument showing this is not double counting in appendix [ app : review_technics ] .
we obtain the background - dependent masses appearing in ( [ eqn : fullv1eff ] ) by expanding the theory about the background value @xmath18 and reading off the quadratic terms for the various quantum fluctuations . in our dimension - six model
the masses are @xmath29 where @xmath30,@xmath31 and @xmath32 are the @xmath33 , @xmath34 and top yukawa couplings respectively . at the zero - temperature minimum one
recovers @xmath35 and @xmath36 .
note that the expressions for the masses of the weak bosons ( from the higgs kinetic term ) and the top quark ( from the yukawa coupling ) are unchanged compared to the sm , and ( [ eqn : nonscalarmasses ] ) are written to confirm our conventions .
the one - loop correction ( [ eqn : fullv1eff ] ) splits into a zero - temperature part and a @xmath37-dependent part  @xcite which vanishes as @xmath38 : @xmath39 with @xmath40\\ \delta v_1^{t}(\phi , t)&=&\sum_{i = h,\chi , w , z , t}\frac{n_i
t^4}{2\pi^2}\int_0^\infty dk k^2\log\left[1\mp e^{\left(-\sqrt{k^2+m_i^2(\phi)/t^2}\right)}\right]\end{aligned}\ ] ] @xmath41 is precisely the ordinary zero temperature effective potential , as it must be to be consistent since @xmath42 as @xmath43 .
the @xmath44 part , being uv - divergent , will be considered first in order to properly determine the renormalized parameters of the quantum theory .
the finite temperature corrections will be treated afterwards .      at zero temperature
the correction ( [ eqn : fullv1eff ] ) reduces to the first term of ( [ eqn : v1split ] ) , @xmath45\label{eqn : dimregpot1}\end{aligned}\ ] ] which has been regularized in @xmath46 dimensions , @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) for gauge bosons ( scalars and fermions ) and @xmath49 .
we work in the @xmath50 scheme to renormalize and evaluate our potential ( see the appendix  [ sec : t=0corrections ] for an alternative , but ultimately equivalent , on - shell scheme approach ) .
the full one - loop effective potential is v_eff()=^2+^4+^6+v^0_1 ( ) where the parameters of this potential ( @xmath51 ) are bare parameters , but an implicit @xmath52 will cancel their infinite pieces , leaving the finite pieces as the renormalized parameters .    to determine the parameters of the lagrangian in terms of physical quantities
, we must impose renormalization conditions at some chosen scale @xmath53 .
the renormalization conditions are v_eff(=v_0 , _ * ) & = & 0 + v_eff(=v_0 , _ * ) & = & m_h^2 + v_eff(=v_0 , _ * ) & = & the left side of each equation is the theory computation , and depends on the parameters of the theory ( @xmath51 ) . the right side of each equation is a measurement ( @xmath54 and @xmath55 ) or related to a measurement ( @xmath56 is a requirement that the potential is at a minimum which recovers the correct @xmath57 boson mass ) .
the vev depends on the choice of scale as well .
we define @xmath58 to be equal to the vev of the higgs field in the landau gauge at @xmath59 such that the @xmath50 @xmath57 mass is recovered .
performing our computations with the latest electroweak precision measurements  @xcite , we find @xmath60 to a good approximation for a higgs mass in our range of interest ( @xmath61 ) .
this higgs vev is close to the @xmath62 value in  @xcite .
we can invert these equations to obtain the theory parameters as a function of measurements : m^2 _ * & = & m^2(m_h^2,,v_0 , _ * ) + _ * & = & ( m_h^2,,v_0 , _ * ) + _ * & = & ( m^2_h,,v_0 , _ * ) note , the parameters have scale dependence , and we have defined @xmath63 , etc .    up to now
we have glossed over some important subtleties .
the physical higgs mass must be defined at @xmath64 , whereas the one - loop effective potential is constructed for @xmath65 . to take account of this , and retain the label @xmath66 for the physical higgs boson mass , we need to rewrite the renormalization condition as m^2_h m^2_h-(m^2_h)+(0 ) , where @xmath67 is the two - point function of the higgs boson ( numerically , we used the looptools software  @xcite to evaluate this two - point function ) .
this approach has the added benefit that the ir singularity in @xmath68 as the goldstone mass goes to zero is canceled by the ir singularity in @xmath69 .
we discuss these ir singularity issues in more detail in the appendix  [ app : onshell ] .
the physical parameter @xmath55 is not a unique choice for how to parametrize the measured tri - higgs coupling , and we wish to rewrite it in a more convenient manner .
first , like the higgs mass , the higgs tri - scalar coupling has ir divergences at @xmath65 when the goldstone bosons become massless .
these ir divergences are also not dangerous because they are matched by the ir divergences of @xmath70 , and cancel in measured cross - sections .
thus , it is convenient to separate out this ir divergence when parametrizing the tri - higgs coupling observable : @xmath71 , where @xmath72 contains ir sensitive goldstone terms is given by @xmath73 ^ 3}{m^2_\chi(v_0)}\right]$ ] , where @xmath74 .
@xmath75 is given by the above expression where the limit @xmath76 is taken in @xmath77 . ] .
furthermore , since the tri - higgs coupling @xmath55 in the sm is fixed once the higgs mass is known , we would like our convention to reflect this manifestly in the decoupling limit of @xmath78 , _ 0 ^sm_f^sm+_ir^sm for finite values of @xmath79 , the deviations of @xmath80 from @xmath81 can be defined by convention to be _
this convention ( i.e. , the factor of 6 ) ensures that @xmath15 can be identified directly as the decay constant of the strong sector , @xmath10 , at tree level .
putting these elements together , we can now rewrite the third renormalization condition as v_eff(v_0)=^sm_f++_ir .
[ eq : xi ] we emphasize that eq .
( [ eq : xi ] ) is merely a reparametrization of the tri - higgs physical observable in terms of the decay constant , @xmath10 , rather than @xmath55 for the benefits described above , and that @xmath81 is a computable function of @xmath54 .    following the prescription provided above , all the parameters of our higgs potential ( @xmath51 )
can now be written in terms of physical observables ( @xmath82 ) .
thus , we are now able to analyze the potential using physical observables as inputs .      from the splitting  ( [ eqn : v1split ] ) of the full one - loop effective potential into a @xmath44 part and a @xmath83 part , we get that the latter finite temperature component is : @xmath84\label{eqn : pottcorrections}\\ & \equiv&\sum_{i={\rm bosons}}\frac{n_it^4}{2\pi^2 } j_b\left(\frac{m^2_i(\phi)}{t^2}\right)+\sum_{i={\rm fermions}}\frac{n_it^4}{2\pi^2 } j_f\left(\frac{m^2_i(\phi)}{t^2}\right)\nonumber\end{aligned}\ ] ] where the upper ( lower ) sign stands for bosons ( fermions ) . in the high - temperature regime ( @xmath85 ) , the @xmath86 function expansions are @xmath87 with @xmath88 and @xmath89 .
note that in @xcite only the first terms in ( [ eqn : hightb ] ) and ( [ eqn : hightf ] ) were retained , which leads to the following approximate thermal one - loop correction : @xmath90 with @xmath91 .
the dominant contributions gathered in ( [ eqn : v1tgsw ] ) are simply a ( positive ) thermal mass which ( meta)-stabilizes the origin of the potential at high temperature .
this approximation was sufficient in @xcite , and further refined in  @xcite , to demonstrate the possibility of a strong first order pt within an effective extension of the sm .
( [ fig : potentials ] ) shows the discrepancy between the complete thermal correction and the high - temperature expansion around the critical temperature , illustrating the worthwhileness of using the integrals of ( [ eqn : pottcorrections ] ) for the more detailed analysis .
gev and @xmath92  gev ( @xmath10 is the decay constant of the strong sector the higgs emerges from ) .
the dashed curve is the potential of @xcite which includes only the thermal mass term of the higgs , while the solid and dotted ones represent the full one - loop potential with ( solid ) and without ( dotted ) the ring diagram contributions . in blue ,
we have also plotted the imaginary part of the full one - loop potential with the ring contributions ( solid blue ) as well as the imaginary part of the ring contributions alone ( dashed blue ) .
this illustrates the cancelation of the large imaginary parts between the ring and the one - loop contributions , while there still exists an additional and smaller imaginary part for some values of @xmath18 due to a negative quartic coupling ( see the discussion in section  [ sec : imcancelation ] for details ) .
an imaginary part of the potential can be interpreted as a decay rate of some quantum states of the scalar fields to some others but the imaginary part of the full potential is always tiny compared to the real part around the transition temperature and the system is stable enough throughout the entire time of the transition . ]      in thermal quantum field theory , the traditional perturbative expansion in terms of small coupling constants breaks down due to ir - divergences ( inherent in massless models ) generated by long - range fluctuations appearing as soon as one moves to finite temperature @xcite .
for instance , taking massless @xmath93 theory at finite temperature , one can show that the self - energy , which goes like @xmath94 at first order , receives a subleading @xmath95 correction and not @xmath96 as one would expect  @xcite . for our case , in the high - temperature expansion , or equivalently small mass expansion , of the thermal bosonic corrections ( [ eqn : hightb ] ) , we also see a sign of this perturbation theory breakdown through the emergence of a monomial term of order @xmath48 .
the main consequence is that , as it stands , we can not trust the completeness of the one - loop result ( [ eqn : pottcorrections ] ) because there are some higher - loop corrections of the same order @xcite , as if the effect of temperature is to  dilute ' the one - loop correction to some multi - loop orders in the ir .
furthermore the leading part of these multi - loop corrections is all contained in the so - called ring ( or daisy ) diagrams shown in fig .
( [ fig : ring ] ) .
they are @xmath97-loop diagrams where @xmath98 of them are  ring attached ' to a main one .
since this  loop - dilution ' is a finite temperature effect , the ring diagrams only need to be resummed in the ir - limit of vanishing momenta running in their petals @xcite .
it is also well - known that they can be taken into account by using propagators resummed in the ir  @xcite . by solving a dyson - like equation ,
this turns out to simply shift the bosonic masses by a @xmath37-dependent constant as @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the self - energy of the ( bosonic ) field @xmath101 in the ir limit , @xmath102 , known as a debye mass ( @xmath100 is labeled as @xmath103 in  @xcite ) .
the higher - loop ring diagrams are needed due to ir divergences ( i.e. , @xmath104 ) . on the other hand ,
the one - loop result is trustworthy for massive ( i.e. , @xmath105 ) particles , because the long - range fluctuations arising at finite temperature will never hit an ir mass - pole in such cases .
hence the ring diagrams will only contribute significantly at high - temperature ( @xmath106 ) where the particles can be approximated as nearly massless .
also , this allows us to understand why only the bosonic degrees of freedom feel the breakdown of the perturbative expansion .
the reason is that only bosonic fields have a vanishing matsubara frequency , recalling that @xmath23 equals @xmath107 for bosons and @xmath108 for fermions .
only this particular ( zero-)mode will behave as a massless degree of freedom and generate ir - divergences at high - temperature , while the other ( non zero-)modes @xmath23 act as a mass of order @xmath37 and thus lead to negligible contributions . therefore the fermionic propagators need not be resummed , because fermions do not have pole - mass in the ir .        applying the techniques of  @xcite to our theory ,
we compute the finite temperature mass shifts ( debye masses ) that are needed in the ring diagram resummation : @xmath109 note that these @xmath110 s are computed in the high - temperature limit of the unbroken phase which is justified by the ring diagrams being irrelevant for @xmath111 as we have discussed . at high temperature the photon and @xmath57 are not mass eigenstates , but one can treat them as mass eigenstates in this computation with the above - given debye masses and obtain the correct resummed potential .      the traditional way the ring diagrams are implemented in the literature
consists in shifting all the matsubara modes for the bosonic fields .
this is the so - called self - consistent method @xcite where the potential ( [ eqn : fullv1eff ] ) is replaced by @xmath112.\ ] ] the thermal shift of the gauge masses only for the longitudinal polarizations is understood , and @xmath113 is simply zero .
however , when applying this approach the uv divergent part becomes @xmath37-dependent through the @xmath110 and requires @xmath37-dependent counter - terms to be made finite . indeed after doing to ( [ eqn : v1tselfconsistent ] ) the same splitting procedure we did to get ( [ eqn : v1split ] ) , and
after dimensionally regularizing the uv - divergent part , we get the following result : @xmath114\ ] ] where the @xmath115 factor depends on @xmath37 .
this standard technique clashes with physical intuition since it would mean that the uv behavior of the theory depends on the ir dynamics .
although this mixing is not introducing any calculational errors to our working approximation , one can avoid it by simply shifting only the @xmath116 matsubara modes which carry the leading contribution from the ring diagrams relevant at one - loop order .    as argued above
, the dilution of the one - loop correction happens only for massless modes .
hence all the corrections we seek within the ring diagrams are gathered when resumming only the zero - mode of the propagator in the ir .
doing so , ( [ eqn : fullv1eff ] ) is to be replaced by @xmath117\nonumber\\ & & + \int \frac{d^3k}{(2\pi)^3}\log\left[\vec{k}^2+m^2_i(\phi)+\pi_i(t)\right]\big\}\\ & \equiv&\delta v_1(\phi , t)+\delta v_{ring}(\phi , t)\end{aligned}\ ] ] where the prime means that the zero modes are excluded from the sum .
we can easily extract the ring part from the last expression and we find @xmath118\nonumber\\ & = & \sum_{i = h,\chi , w , z,\gamma}\frac{\bar{n}_it}{12\pi}\left[m^3_i(\phi)-\left(m^2_i(\phi)+\pi_i(t)\right)^{3/2}\right]\label{eqn : vring},\end{aligned}\ ] ] where an irrelevant ( infinite ) constant has been ignored in the second line , and @xmath119 . notice that @xmath120 includes a monomial of order @xmath48 which proves a posteriori the existence of a perturbation theory breakdown in evaluating the higgs potential .
furthermore , these extra corrections modify the cubic term in @xmath121 , which partly controls the strength of the first order phase transition .
thus , the addition of these terms is critical for our analysis of the electroweak phase transition .    in summary ,
the full @xmath37-dependent renormalized effective potential at one - loop is v_eff()&=&^2+^4 + ^6 + _ i = h,,w , z , tn_i[eqn : potmsbar ] + & & + _ i = bosons j_b()+_i = fermions j_f ( ) + & & + _ i = h,,w , z , where definitions of all terms are given above .
this is the potential we analyze for the remainder of the article .
as the scalar masses become negative , the various contributions we obtained for the quantum potential develop some imaginary parts which we discuss below for both the @xmath44 and @xmath83 cases .      in the zero - temperature limit
, the logarithm of ( [ eqn : potmsbar ] ) leads to the following scheme - independent imaginary part . ]
@xmath122=\sum_{i = h,\chi}\theta(-m^2_i(\phi))\frac{n_i |m_i(\phi)|^4}{64\pi}\ ] ] where @xmath123 is the heaviside function which equals 1 when the field @xmath124 is tachyonic , and zero otherwise .
the higgs boson can obtain a negative mass squared for some values of its vev , originating from the fact that the classical potential is not convex everywhere .
indeed , depending on the cutoff value , either the origin is unstable ( @xmath125 ) or a potential barrier separates two local minima ( @xmath126 ) , both of which lead to concave regions of the effective potential as a function of the vev .
a similar analysis shows that the goldstone boson can become tachyonic for some values of the vev as well , leading to another contribution to the imaginary part of the effective potential .
however , we shall see shortly that the imaginary part ( [ eqn : impart0 ] ) exactly cancels out with another contribution coming from the finite temperature corrections for the temperature range we are interested in for the phase transition .      at finite temperature both the integrals of ( [ eqn : pottcorrections ] ) and the ring contributions ( [ eqn : vring ] )
are spoiled by imaginary parts when scalar fields are tachyons . in the high - temperature limit ,
the imaginary part of ( [ eqn : pottcorrections ] ) is ( see ( [ eqn : hightb ] ) ) : @xmath127\underset{\frac{|m_i(\phi)|}{t}\to 0}{\longrightarrow}\   \sum_{i = h,\chi}\theta(-m^2_i(\phi))n_i\left[-\frac{|m_i(\phi)|^4}{64\pi}+\frac{|m_i(\phi)|^3 t}{12\pi}\right].\label{eqn : imparthight}\ ] ] the first term cancels the imaginary part from the logarithm of the @xmath44 potential correction ( [ eqn : impart0 ] ) , while the second is only compensated when the ring diagrams are added , since their imaginary part is given by @xmath128=-\sum_{i = h,\chi}\theta(-m^2_i(\phi))\frac{n_it}{12\pi}|m_i(\phi)|^3\ ] ] as long as the temperature satisfies @xmath129 for all @xmath18 .
although somewhat more complicated algebraically to show ( see appendix  [ app : imcancelation ] for details ) , this cancellation occurs also for smaller temperatures of order @xmath130 .    nevertheless and despite this cancelation ,
the potential is not everywhere real because for some values of @xmath37 and @xmath131 , @xmath132 and the second term of the ring correction  ( [ eqn : vring ] ) becomes imaginary . in the sm
this term does not lead to an imaginary part once the temperature ( meta)stabilizes the origin since the sm scalars could only become tachyonic for a negative quadratic coupling in the higgs potential .
thus , the sm potential is real as long as the origin is ( meta)stable . on the other hand , with the additional @xmath7 piece in the potential , the scalar masses can be negative also through a negative quartic coupling , allowing this additional imaginary part to the potential at temperature around the critical temperature .
an imaginary part of the potential can be interpreted as a decay rate of some quantum states of the scalar fields to some others  @xcite .
thus , one can rely on the real part of the potential as long as its imaginary part remains small enough to consider the field stable during the phase transition , in which case it can be discarded .
we checked that the imaginary part of the one - loop potential is always tiny compared to the real part around the transition temperature , thanks to the previously demonstrated cancelations of large imaginary pieces .
thus , we conclude that the system is stable enough throughout the entire time of the transition , and that its dynamics is driven by the real part of the one - loop potential we computed .
now that we have the formalism developed for our analysis of the finite temperature higgs potential at one loop , we are in the position to study the dynamics of the phase transition
. one of our first considerations must be the analysis of when ( and if ) the phase transition actually occurs .
this is not simply a matter of determining the temperature at which the symmetry breaking minimum becomes the global minimum .
an analysis of the energetics of bubble formation must be undertaken for a more complete picture .
the nucleated bubbles can then undergo collisions and the surrounding plasma experience turbulence , which generate gravity waves that could possibly be detected in experiments .
we discuss these issues in this section .    throughout this section ,
we report our numerical results of various relevant quantities as contour plots that scan the allowed region of the parameter space @xmath133 .
we recall that @xmath54 is the physical higgs mass while @xmath10 is the decay constant of the strong sector ( or more generally the energy scale suppressing the @xmath7 operator ) physically defined through the triple higgs self - interaction as defined in the previous sections , and we work in the @xmath50 scheme for @xmath59 .
the bounds delinating the region of first - order phase transition are both numerically computed using the complete one - loop potential at finite temperature .
the lower one is set by requiring that ew symmetry is broken at @xmath44 and restores at high temperature , while above the upper bound the higgs vacuum is likely to undergo a second - order phase transition or a smooth crossover . in general , determining the latter is not an easy task as it requires a non - perturbative analysis of the effective potential when the transition is not strongly first - order @xcite .
indeed , the phase transition always appears first - order at the perturbative level , even though very weakly .
moreover , as @xmath10 increases one tends to recover the sm potential , which leads non - perturbatively to a continuous crossover , instead of a weak first - order transition at one - loop , for @xmath134 gev @xcite .
we estimated the upper bound by considering that as soon as the phase transition is as weak as in the sm for @xmath135 gev , it is likely to be a crossover .
the effective potential ensures the presence of a potential barrier at finite temperature which is a necessary ingredient to have a first - order phase transition .
it proceeds by spontaneous nucleation of non - vanishing vev bubbles into a surrounding symmetric metastable vacuum .
as soon as the universe cools down to a critical temperature @xmath136 the symmetry - breaking vacuum becomes energetically favorable and then thermal fluctuations allow the bubbles to form .
however , the temperature of the transition is not necessarily close to @xmath136
. once created , a bubble needs to consume a part of the latent heat liberated in order to maintain its interface with the symmetric phase surrounding it .
it turns out that for @xmath37 just below @xmath136 it is often the case that the bubbles are too small and surface tension makes them collapse and disappear .
hence the phase transition effectively starts at a smaller temperature when enough free energy is available to permit the nucleation of sufficiently large bubbles that can grow and convert the entire universe into the broken phase .
this supercooling phenomenon can substantially delay the phase transition and thus modify the spectrum of gravity waves significantly , as we shall discuss shortly ( important supercooling effects were also observed in some of the analyses of ref .
@xcite )      although the probability to tunnel via the excitation of @xmath137 instantons is very tiny , about @xmath138 , the decay of the false vacuum can nonetheless proceed through thermal fluctuations which help to overcome the potential barrier .
the rate per unit of space - time for this process is given in the semi - classical wkb approximation by @xmath139 where @xmath140 is the euclidean action for the higgs vev evaluated on the so - called bounce solution of the euclidean equation of motion @xcite .
for temperatures much higher than their inverse radius , the bubbles overlap in euclidean time and feel the ir breaking of lorentz symmetry @xcite , in which case the bounce solution is @xmath141-symmetric and is the solution of @xmath142 subject to the boundary conditions @xmath143 the bounce solution physically represents the higgs vev profile of a static unstable ( either expanding or shrinking ) bubble , and @xmath144 measures the distance from the bubble center .
for such a static solution of the equation of motion , the action factorizes as @xmath145 , with @xmath146.\ ] ] moreover for small temperatures of the order of the bubble size , we replace the @xmath141 bounce for the @xmath147-symmetric solution which minimizes the action when the breaking of lorentz symmetry is not significant .
finally we use the traditional overshooting / undershooting method to numerically solve the equation of motion .
there is a supercooling effect that can delay the onset of the first order phase transition to temperatures much smaller than @xmath148 .
a first order phase transition can only proceed in the presence of a potential barrier separating the two vacua and the nucleation could potentially start at a temperature @xmath149 far below that of @xmath136 .
this is especially likely in the case where the barrier persists down to @xmath44 .
since the amount of supercooling is controlled by the size of the nucleated bubble , one needs to take into account that the phase transition proceeds in an expanding universe .
one can thus consider that the nucleation starts at the time when the probability of creating at least one bubble per horizon volume is of order one .
this condition guarantees the percolation of bubbles in the early universe and translates into the following criterion for determining the nucleation temperature : @xmath150 where @xmath151 is the reduced planck mass .
the contours of constant nucleation temperature are reported in the left panel of fig .
[ fig : tn ] .
we point out that there exists a region ( painted red in fig .
[ fig : tn ] ) with low @xmath10 and @xmath152 such that the criterion eq .
( [ eqn : nucleation ] ) is not satisfied , meaning that the expansion of the universe does not permit the bubbles to percolate .
thus the nucleation never starts and the universe remains trapped in a symmetric vacuum .
in addition , the right panel of fig .  [
fig : tn ] helps one to realize further the numerical significance of the supercooling effect by plotting the deviation of the nucleation temperature @xmath149 from @xmath136 .
we see that , for large values of @xmath10 , the deviation is not significant since the potential barrier disappears at a temperature not much less than the critical one . on the another hand , as soon as one lowers @xmath10 , the barrier persists to lower and lower temperatures , making the supercooling delay of the phase transition important .
thus the knowledge of the nucleation temperature becomes necessary to clearly understand the dynamics of the phase transition in this region .
[ cols='^,^ ' , ]      future interferometry experiments could offer us a way to observe the ewpt .
a detailed analysis of the potential to directly see gravitational waves from the first - order phase transition can be compared with the sensitivity expected from the correlated third generation ligo detector on earth and the lisa and bbo detectors in space .
a general analysis that we utilize has been presented in  @xcite , where both bubble collisions and turbulent motions were considered .
qualitatively , gravity - wave detectors will give us a better chance to observe the phase transition today if the latent heat energy released is large and the emission lasts a long time .
this can be understood easily by recalling that the power spectrum is given by the square of the quadrupole moment of the source which in turns scales as the kinetic energy over the time of emission @xcite . in other words , typically @xmath153 has to be @xmath154 and @xmath155 as small as @xmath156 to get a sufficiently high energy density @xmath157 .    relying on our effective ( nonrenormalizable ) potential approach , we find that generically the dynamics of the first order ewpt beyond the sm generate too weak gravity waves to observe except for a tiny region of the parameter space .
namely , by looking closely at figs .
[ fig : alpha&beta ] one can see that for a higgs mass slightly above the lep2 bound , @xmath158 gev , and a relatively low scale , @xmath159 gev , we get at best @xmath160 and @xmath161 .
the corresponding nucleation temperature in this region is about @xmath162 gev , according to fig  [ fig : tn ] .
for such a temperature scale , only lisa and bbo will be sensitive to the emitted spectrum of gravity waves , according to the results presented in figs .  3 and 4 of  @xcite .
its detectability is probably beyond the capability of lisa .
this result is in qualitative agreement with the results of  @xcite .
indeed lisa requires at least values of @xmath163 for @xmath161 in order to see the characteristic peak from turbulence while the collision peak starts to be probed for @xmath164 . on the other hand , bbo should be able to observe both peaks if @xmath153 is around @xmath165 ( keeping @xmath161 ) .
gev and @xmath166  gev where @xmath167 , @xmath168 and @xmath169  gev .
note that suitable values of @xmath170 to get a strong signal always imply a small nucleation temperature ( @xmath171 gev ) due to important overcooling effects that drag the peak below the lower bound of the space - based detectors frequency band ( @xmath172 hz ) , making the gravity waves delicate to observe . ]
thus it seems that one will have to wait until the launching of the second generation of space - based interferometers to really study the ewpt through gravity wave detectors within this framework .
moreover this would be possible only in the maximizing case where the higgs mass is close to its current experimental bound and the composite scale of the higgs is relatively low .
in this article we have reported on a complete computation of the one - loop finite temperature effective potential in models where the higgs boson is composite and emerges as a light pseudo - goldstone boson of a strongly interacting sector ( our analysis could also be relevant for studying the dynamics of electroweak symmetry breaking in little higgs theories ) .
these models are characterized by higher dimensional operators in the higgs sector suppressed by the strong decay constant , @xmath10 , a scale parametrically smaller than the cutoff of the strong sector .
interestingly , by following the details of the phase transition dynamics , the parameter space of a strong first - order phase transition has actually grown for large value of @xmath10 , and shrunk for small value of @xmath10 cutoff , compared to the tree - level result found in  @xcite .
it has grown at the higher end by going beyond the high temperature approximation .
the parameter space has shrunk on the lower end , since we found that bubbles can not be nucleated well enough there to overcome the effects of an expanding universe .
we encountered some subtleties along the way , including infrared singularities and imaginary components to the potential , that were resolved .
it was also necessary to compute the details of the phase transition dynamics in order to investigate the possibility of detecting gravitational radiation from the first order phase transition occuring in the early universe .
after bubbles are nucleated , their collisions and subsequent turbulence in the plasma give rise to gravity waves . in the assumption of a detonation regime ,
the effects depend on only two parameters , the latent heat @xmath153 and the duration of the phase transition @xmath173 , both of which can be determined by solving the bounce equation , and analyzing the full one - loop finite temperature effective potential at the scale of the nucleation temperature .
although ligo and lisa are likely not sensitive to these effects , we found that bbo , a planned second generation experiment of space - based interferometers , could be sensitive to the gravity waves produced during this phase transition .

the on - shell scheme identifies lagrangian parameters as physical parameter ( i.e. , observables ) .
it is the scheme employed by  @xcite , although we augment that discussion by describing a self - consistent approach with higher order operators , and describe the details of how ir divergences from massless goldstone bosons cancel .
renormalizing our theory in the on - shell scheme is most convenient when we begin by writing the full potential in the following form : v_tree()= ( ^2-v_0 ^ 2)^2 + ( ^2-v_0 ^ 2)^3 + v_1 ^ 0()+^2+^4 + ^6 where @xmath174\label{eqn : zerotcorrection}\\ & = & \sum_{i = h,\chi , w , z , t}n_i\frac{m_{i}^4(\phi)}{64\pi^2}\left[\log\frac{m^2_{i}(\phi)}{\mu^2}-c_i - c_{uv}\right]\label{eqn : dimregpot}\end{aligned}\ ] ] which has been regularized in @xmath46 dimensions , @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) for gauge bosons ( scalars and fermions ) and @xmath49 . in this parametrization of the tree - potential ,
the scalar @xmath18-dependent masses are : @xmath175 and @xmath176 .
the on - shell scheme imposes that @xmath58 is the vacuum expectation of the higgs field , @xmath177 , and @xmath178 .
the precise meaning of @xmath179 is defined below .
the counter terms , @xmath180 , are determined by the renormalization conditions : @xmath181 where @xmath182 and @xmath183 are needed to take us from the ir - sensitive and unphysical @xmath65 limit of the effective potential to @xmath64 , where physical observables @xmath54 and the tri - higgs coupling @xmath184 are defined .
detailed computations demonstrating the cancelation of the ir divergences in this scheme are presented in appendix  [ app : onshell ] .
we wish to have a more direct physical parameter that parametrizes deviations from the sm , and so we redefine [ eqn : xidef ] _ phys^sm_phys+ which constitutes the definition of the physical observable @xmath10 . recall that the tri - higgs coupling in the sm is fixed with knowledge of @xmath54 , and thus @xmath185 is determined completely by @xmath54 and the other parameters of the sm : ^sm_phys= + _ i .
since @xmath186 depends on @xmath187 , this expression is technically equal to the sm one only in the limit of @xmath188 , which is all that we need for the analysis to be self - consistent .
we are now able to invert the renormalization conditions and compute the counter terms , which depend on the various derivatives of @xmath189 , @xmath190 , and @xmath191 . upon expanding the result
, one can express the renormalized full one - loop potential as v_eff ( ) & = & ( ^2-v_0 ^ 2)^2+(^2-v_0 ^ 2)^3 + & & + _
i = h,,w , z , t + & & + ( 7-v_0 ) ^2 + ( -5+v_0 ) ^4 + ( 3-v_0)^6 where all the @xmath10-dependence of the loop - order contribution to the potential is contained in the field - dependent masses , making the continuity of the decoupling limit explicit .
in this appendix , we gather the detailed computations for the results mentioned in appendix  [ sec : t=0corrections ] about smoothing the goldstone ir singularity in the one - loop potential at zero temperature . first , we shall briefly recall how one moves from zero - momentum to on - shell scheme in the sm , as a warm - up for the dimension - six operator discussion that will come afterwards .      in the sm the loop - integral of ( [ eqn : zerotcorrection ] )
can be renormalized by imposing the two conditions @xmath192 which leads to the traditional form of the effective potential v^(sm)_eff ( ) & = & ( ^2-v_0 ^ 2)^2 + & & + _ iwhere the scalar masses must be evaluated in the decoupling limit of the dimension - six operator ( @xmath193 ) .
as we will review , @xmath194 is an off - shell higgs mass defined at @xmath65 .
this is fine to use as long as no massless particle couples to the higgs field @xcite .
if such particles like the goldstone bosons are to be taken into account , one must move away from zero - momentum to avoid the pole - mass at @xmath65 that makes both @xmath194 and the one - loop potential ir divergent .    in order to see how this can be done , we recall that near the symmetry breaking minimum ( @xmath195 ) the renormalized effective potential can always be expanded in terms of 1pi - green functions evaluated at vanishing external momentum as follow : @xmath196 where
@xmath197 are the @xmath198-legs renormalized 1pi green functions for the physical higgs scalar evaluated about the true vacuum ( i.e. , in the shifted theory ) .
this expansion directly follows from the fact that the effective action may be intepreted as a generating functional of these 1pi green functions .
hence the second derivative of the effective potential at @xmath58 is simply the renormalized two - point function at zero - momentum : @xmath199 given that the two - point function ( the inverse propagator ) of the higgs is @xmath200 where @xmath201 and @xmath67 are the renormalized higgs mass and one - loop higgs self - energy , we see that imposing the renormalization condition ( [ eqn : rc2off ] ) leads to @xmath202 justifying that @xmath194 is to be understood as the zero - momentum higgs mass . in order to circumvent
the ir divergences a natural choice would be to express the right - hand side of ( [ eqn : rc2off ] ) in terms of physical parameters .
the physical higgs mass ( @xmath54 ) is defined as the pole of the one - loop resummed propagator ( @xmath203 ) and is given by solving the self - consistent equation : @xmath204 this allows us to rewrite ( [ eqn : appd2veff ] ) as @xmath205 with @xmath206 .
when @xmath190 is absent the uv - finite one - loop correction at zero temperature for the sm has an ir divergent piece coming from the goldstone contribution : @xmath207 where @xmath208 will be kept non - zero as a regulator in what follows . moving to the on - shell renormalization scheme ( i.e. , replacing ( [ eqn : rc2off ] ) by ( [ eqn : rc1b ] ) ) results in the addition of the following term to @xmath209 : @xmath210 now @xmath211 receives an ir singularity from the diagram depicted in fig .
[ fig:2ptirdiv ] which can be easily calculated to give : @xmath212 combining ( [ eqn : amp2ptirdiv ] ) with ( [ eqn : extrav1rsm ] ) , one gets the following ir divergent contribution to the potential ( up to an irrelevant @xmath18-independent term ) : @xmath213 which exactly cancels out ( [ eqn : v1smirdiv ] ) .    .
]      the presence of the dimension six interaction at tree - level forces us to set one more derivative of the potential to an extra measurable quantity . focusing only on the decoupling limit
this can be accomplished by |_=v_0&=&_0[eqn : rc3off ] , where [ eqn : xidef2 ] _ 0++_i .
as can be easily checked , defining only the higgs mass on - shell does not smooth out entirely the bad ir behavior of the one - loop potential in the non - renormalizable case .
in fact @xmath10 , being another parameter to be fixed at the quantum level , needs also to be renormalized away from zero - momentum to avoid the goldstone pole , which is done by defining the renormalized three - point function of the higgs boson on - shell . as for the two - point function , from ( [ eqn : appveffexpansion ] ) one gets @xmath214 where @xmath215 denotes the external momenta of the three - point function .
@xmath216 can be split into a tree - level coupling and a one - loop correction as @xmath217 where @xmath218 is the renormalized cubic self - couplings of the higgs at tree - level .
similarly to the higgs mass , we see that imposing ( [ eqn : rc3off ] ) implies working with a parameter @xmath219 , or rather @xmath220 through ( [ eqn : xidef2 ] ) , defined at zero - momentum which leads again to ir divergent behavior .
we propose defining an on - shell cubic coupling at one - loop by @xmath221 which translates into an on - shell ( physical ) definition of @xmath10 by means of ( [ eqn : xidef ] ) . finally by expressing ( [ eqn : rc3off ] ) in terms of physical parameters ,
we get the on - shell renormalization condition of ( [ eqn : rc1c ] ) @xmath222 where @xmath223 .    now by enforcing the three renormalization conditions ( [ eqn : rc1a]),([eqn : rc1b ] ) and ( [ eqn : rc1c ] ) to set the counter - terms , we find that the zero - momentum potential is augmented by @xmath224\left(\phi^2-v_0 ^ 2\right)^3\end{aligned}\ ] ] we recall that in terms of @xmath194 and @xmath219 the effective potential develops a logarithmic ir singularity of the same form as in the sm but with @xmath10-dependent masses : @xmath225 while @xmath219 defined in ( [ eqn : xidef2 ] ) has a power - law divergence .
nonetheless @xmath226 contains ir - divergent parts from the diagrams of fig .
[ fig:3ptirdiv ] which are @xmath227    hence the power - law divergence of @xmath191 cancels with the one of ( [ eqn : xidef2 ] ) making @xmath184 a well - defined quantity .
the remaining logarithmic divergence of the three - point function along with the one from the self - energy , which turns out to be the same as in the sm , @xmath228 gives after some simple algebra ( up to irrelevant constant and @xmath229 terms ) @xmath230 which cancels with eq .
( [ eqn : appv1offirdiv ] ) .
finally , one finds that this procedure also leads to a uv and ir finite potential when a different higher derivative is chosen as a third renormalization condition .    .
all the momenta are assumed to be zero in the external lines . ]
the original method proposed by jackiw in @xcite to compute loop corrections to the classical potential is based upon expanding the action about ( constant ) background values for the various fields appearing in the theory . in our case
only the neutral higgs component has a non - vanishing vev , and we recall here in a concise way how this method allows one to derive the one - loop correction given in ( [ eqn : fullv1eff ] ) . at the start , we consider the @xmath44 correction , and discuss the finite @xmath37 corrections in the next subsection of this appendix .    as an illustration we focus on a simple self - interacting scalar ( real ) field theory defined by the following generating functional : @xmath231\equiv \int [ \mathcal{d}\phi]\mbox{exp}\left[i(s[\varphi]+j\varphi)\right]\ ] ] where the notation @xmath232 will be assumed throughout this appendix , and the action is @xmath233=\int d^4x[(\partial_\mu\varphi)^2/2-v_0(\varphi)]$ ] .
then one shifts the field by a @xmath234-independent background value ( @xmath235 ) where @xmath18 is assumed to be a classical field configuration and @xmath17 represents a quantum fluctuation about it . we will now integrate out this fluctuation to get its effect on the potential up to one - loop order . to do so
, one defines the shifted theory ( whose dynamical field is now @xmath17 ) by expanding the action about its classical value : @xmath236+j(\phi+h)=s[\phi]+j\phi+h\left(\frac{\delta s}{\delta \varphi}\big|_{\varphi=\phi}+j\right)+\frac{1}{2}h_x\frac{\delta^2 s}{\delta\varphi_x\delta\varphi_y}\big|_{\varphi=\phi}h_y+\cdots\ ] ] where thanks to the equation of motion in the presence of a source the linear term vanishes .
the @xmath237 stand for higher ( than quadratic ) orders in @xmath17 which lead to ( at most ) two - loop corrections @xcite .
one also easily obtains after an integration by parts that @xmath238 plugging this expansion back into ( [ eqn : appzj ] ) one obtains @xmath239&\simeq & e^{i(s[\phi]+j\phi)}\times\int[\mathcal{d}h]\exp\left[\frac{i}{2}h_x\frac{\delta^2 s}{\delta\varphi_x\delta\varphi_y}\big|_{\varphi=\phi}h_y\right]\nonumber\\ & = & e^{i(s[\phi]+j\phi)}\times\mbox{det}\left(\box+v_0''(\phi)\right)^{-\frac{1}{2}}.\end{aligned}\ ] ] we recall that by definition the effective action is the legendre - transform of the logarithm of @xmath240 $ ] @xmath241\equiv - i\log z[j]-j\phi,\ ] ] which in our case , including the quantum fluctuations at one - loop , takes the form : @xmath242=s[\phi]+\frac{i}{2}tr\log\left(-\frac{\delta^2 s}{\delta\varphi_x\delta\varphi_y}\big|_{\varphi=\phi}\right).\ ] ] moreover @xmath243 can always admit a derivative expansion of the form : @xmath241\equiv\int d^4x\left[-v_{eff}(\phi)+a(\phi)(\partial_\mu \phi)^2+\cdots\right],\ ] ] which defines precisely what one calls the effective potential .
since @xmath18 is an homogeneous configuration in space - time , this simplifies to : @xmath241=-\mathcal{v } v_{eff}(\phi),\ ] ] where @xmath244 is the volume of space - time we choose to keep finite for the moment .
besides , this homogeneity preserves the diagonality of ( [ eqn : appd2s ] ) in momentum - space , which allows us to evaluate the trace in ( [ eqn : appseff ] ) .
this leads to the following expression for the effective potential : @xmath245 where the sum is over the eigenvalues of the @xmath246 operator in momentum - space . finally by taking the limit of infinite space - time volume ,
one gets the well - known result : @xmath247 the generalization for fields of higher spin that couple to @xmath18 is @xmath248 where @xmath249 is the inverse propagator , @xmath250 for bosons ( fermions ) is the power of the functional determinant , and the @xmath251 denotes an eventual determinant acting on either lorentz or dirac indices .
the imaginary time formalism to go from quantum statistics at zero - temperature to thermal quantum statistics is by compactification of the euclidean time dimension on a circle of radius @xmath252 .
this correspondence is formally obtained in the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics  @xcite .
however , it is worthwhile to give a quick intuitive argument .
we begin with the generating functional for a scalar field in euclidean space - time ( @xmath253 ) : @xmath254=\int [ \mathcal{d}\phi ] \exp\left[-\int d^4x_e\left(\frac{1}{2}\partial_\mu\phi\partial^\mu\phi+v_0(\phi)+j\phi\right)\right].\ ] ] now requiring the euclidean time to lie in the interval @xmath255 , and restricting the field @xmath18 to static configurations , one ends up with @xmath254=\int [ \mathcal{d}\phi ] \exp\left[-\frac{1}{t}\int d^3x\left(\frac{1}{2}\partial_i\phi\partial^i\phi+v_0(\phi)+j\phi\right)\right].\ ] ] for vanishing source the space integral is nothing else but the energy ( @xmath256 $ ] ) stored in a ( time - independent ) field configuration @xmath18 , and the generating functional reduces to @xmath257=\int [ \mathcal{d}\phi]\ e^{-\frac{e[\phi]}{t}}\sim \sum_{s={\rm all\ , states}}e^{-e_s / t},\ ] ] which is the common partition function of statistical mechanics where @xmath18 describes all possible ( static ) configurations of a given system in equilibrium with a heat reservoir at temperature @xmath37 .    therefore the prescription to follow as soon as temperature is switched on is rather simple .
it consists of fourier expanding the fields among its eigen ( matsubara ) frequencies @xmath23 and discretizing the imaginary time integrals by the following replacement rule : @xmath258 for instance , applying ( [ eqn : trule ] ) to momentum integral in ( [ eqn : appv1 ] ) to implement the finite temperature correction leads to a potential of the form presented in ( [ eqn : fullv1eff ] ) : @xmath259      recalling the goldstone equivalence theorem of gauge theory , one might doubt the necessity of counting the longitudinal polarization of a ( massive ) gauge field and its associated goldstone mode as independent degrees of freedom when computing the effective potential in the landau gauge . here
we clarify this fact in the simple case of an abelian higgs model . to do so
, we explicitly compute the one - loop contributions of the @xmath260-gauge , ghost and goldstone fields to the higgs potential in the @xmath261 gauge .
the effective potential turns out to be gauge - dependent , however there is no need to worry since it is not a physical observable .
we work at @xmath44 but the following discussion can be driven the same way when the temperature is turned on , since we never evaluate momentum integrals .
we begin with the gauge field ( @xmath262 ) .
it will affect the higgs potential at one - loop through the following term : @xmath263 where det acts on lorentz indices . in the @xmath261 gauge the inverse propagator has the usual expression in momentum space : @xmath264 with @xmath265 and @xmath266 being the transverse and longitudinal projectors respectively .
since the traces of @xmath267 and the determinant are invariants , we can move to a basis where the matrices @xmath268 are diagonal and read : @xmath269 in this basis the determinant can be easily evaluated and gives : @xmath270\label{eqn : appv1a}\ ] ] now we move to the goldstone boson ( @xmath271 ) and ghost contributions which are @xmath272 given that , in the abelian higgs model , the inverse propagators are @xmath273 with @xmath274 the mass the goldstone receives from its higgs couplings , we obtain @xmath275.\label{eqn : appv1gg}\ ] ] gathering ( [ eqn : appv1a ] ) and ( [ eqn : appv1gg ] ) together , we see the first terms of each expression cancel out , leaving only ( in euclidean space ) @xmath276+\cdots,\ ] ] where @xmath237 stand for constant terms irrelevant for the potential .
taking @xmath277 to move to the landau gauge , the last expression reduces to ( up to an infinite constant ) @xmath278+\cdots,\ ] ] from which one clearly sees that , in this gauge , the factor of 3 for the massive gauge field is not altered by the addition of the goldstone contribution .
another physically meaningful fixing choice is the unitary gauge @xmath279 . sending the gauge fixing parameter to infinity in ( [ eqn : appv1agg ] )
implies the decoupling of the goldstone contribution , as it should : @xmath280+\cdots,\ ] ] again the degrees of freedom of the gauge field are still 3 in this gauge .    from this discussion
we see that interpreting the factors in front of the @xmath281 as the number of polarization states for the corresponding field is only ( accidentally ) true in both @xmath282 gauges . indeed , if one takes for instance the t hooft gauge ( @xmath283 ) the results are @xmath284+\cdots,\ ] ] where now the  degrees of freedom ' of @xmath262 reduce from 3 to 2 by this gauge choice .      in section  [ sec : imcancelation ]
, we have shown that in the high temperature limit , a cancelation occurs between imaginary parts of the one - loop potential and the ring corrections . here
we want to show that this cancellation occurs also for smaller temperatures of order @xmath130 . indeed by working out the integrals of ( [ eqn : pottcorrections ] ) in order to isolate its imaginary part , we get @xmath285 = \sum_{i = h,\chi}\theta(-m^2_i(\phi))\frac{n_it^4}{4\pi^2}\int_0^{\frac{|m_i(\phi)|}{t}}dx x^2\left((4n+1)\pi-\sqrt{\frac{|m_i(\phi)|^2}{t^2}-x^2}\right),\nonumber\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath198 is a positive integer which ensures that @xmath286 so that one stays on the principal sheet when taking the imaginary part of the logarithm , whose branch is assumed to lie on the negative real axis of the complex plane
. we can easily show that @xmath287 as long as @xmath288 , in which case the imaginary part becomes @xmath285&=&\sum_{i = h,\chi}\theta(-m^2_i(\phi))\frac{n_it^4}{4\pi^2}\int_0^{\frac{|m_i(\phi)|}{t}}dx x^2\left(\pi-\sqrt{\frac{|m_i(\phi)|^2}{t^2}-x^2}\right),\nonumber\\ & = & \sum_{i = h,\chi}\theta(-m^2_i(\phi))n_i\left[-\frac{|m_i(\phi)|^4}{64\pi}+\frac{|m_i(\phi)|^3 t}{12\pi}\right]\label{eqn : impartt}\end{aligned}\ ] ] and reproduces the same cancellation with ( [ eqn : impartring ] ) and ( [ eqn : impart0 ] ) as in the high temperature regime .    for completeness
we now consider the case of very low temperatures .
as the temperature cools down below @xmath289 , one begins needing to shift the imaginary part of the @xmath281 by multiples of @xmath290 to remain on the principal sheet of the complex plane .
furthermore , from ( [ eqn : psheet ] ) we see that @xmath291 thus @xmath292 \leq \sum_{i = h,\chi}\theta(-m^2_i(\phi))n_i\frac{|m_i(\phi)|^3 t}{6\pi}\ ] ] and we conclude that @xmath293 $ ] vanishes as @xmath37 goes to zero , as it should .

"stoichiometric euo is a ferromagnetic semiconductor with a curie temperature ( @xmath0 ) of 69  k and a band gap of about 1.2 ev at room temperature.@xcite upon electron doping , the material shows a wealth of spectacular phenomena , including a metal  to  insulator transition and colossal magnetoresistance , where the change in resistivity can exceed 810 orders of magnitude.@xcite the curie temperature can also be doubled by electron doping@xcite and even almost tripled by pressure.@xcite in the ferromagnetic state the conduction band shows a splitting of about 0.6  ev between the spin  up and spin  down states leading to an almost 100% spin polarization of the charge carriers in electron doped euo.@xcite these properties make euo a very attractive candidate for fundamental research in the field of spintronics .
euo in thin film form has been studied already in the late 1960s and early 1970s .
use was made of coevaporation of eu and eu@xmath1o@xmath2,@xcite and later , of evaporation of eu in an oxygen atmosphere,@xcite all under _ technical _ vacuum conditions , i.e. , pressures in the range of 10@xmath310@xmath4 mbar .
the preparation of thin films was considered as a convenient alternative synthesis route for euo , alternative to that of the bulk synthesis which required very high temperatures with a delicate phase diagram.@xcite the use of the thin 
film preparation route specifically facilitated doping dependence studies using rare  earth and transition  metal impurities.@xcite    after a pause of two decades , a strong renewed interest in euo thin films emerged in recent years .
this time it is the thin  film community which is making the attempt to utilize the extraordinary properties of euo for device applications.@xcite part of the motivation also originates from the fact that tremendous progress has been made in preparation technologies , e.g. , molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) under ultra  high 
vacuum conditions , and that new analysis methods have become available , e.g. , synchrotron  based spectroscopies .
all in all , these new efforts have culminated in a high point such that euo thin films can be grown epitaxially on si , demonstrating its potential for spintronics applications.@xcite    it is remarkable in the recent euo research @xcite that control of the stoichiometry is nevertheless still a serious issue .
many studies reported that eu@xmath5 ions were present in their films and/or that the magnetic moment per f.u .
was not close to the expected 7@xmath6 for a @xmath7 system .
it is not clear in what precision the relative supply rates of oxygen and europium were controlled in these works
. we will show below that this control need not be precise as long as one is in the so  called eu  distillation condition during growth .    also layer  by  layer growth has  to our knowledge  never been mentioned , although epitaxy has been often reported .
we therefore set out to do a renewed growth study .
we have chosen for yttria  stabilized cubic zirconia ( ysz ) as substrate@xcite : the lattice constant of ysz is 5.142   , practically identical to the 5.144    value for euo at room temperature,@xcite and epitaxy has been reported already.@xcite yet , it was also claimed that control stoichiometry is extremely difficult,@xcite related to the fact that ysz acts as a source of oxygen@xcite during the mbe growth process .
we will show below that we do have achieved full control of the growth process , i.e. , with stoichiometry control and layer  by  layer epitaxial growth , and that we can use these results as a firm basis for further studies including the doping dependence and the specific use of well  defined interfaces .
the euo films were grown in an ultra  high  vacuum mbe facility with a base pressure of 2@xmath810@xmath9 mbar , maintained by a cryopump .
high purity eu metal from ames laboratory was evaporated from an epi effusion cell with a bn crucible at temperatures between 460@xmath10c and 525@xmath10c .
proper degassing of the eu material ( mostly hydrogen gas ) ensured that during eu evaporation the pressure was kept below 3@xmath810@xmath11 mbar . the eu deposition rate ( 48  / min )
was calibrated using a quartz  crystal monitor which was moved to the sample growth position prior and after each growth .
molecular oxygen was supplied through a leak valve , and its pressure ( 416@xmath810@xmath12 mbar ) was monitored using an ion  gauge and a mass  spectrometer .
the growth was terminated by closing first the oxygen leak valve and then the eu shutter after 30 s.    as substrates we used epipolished single crystals of ysz from surfacenet gmbh and cleaved single crystals of mgo from tbl  kelpin .
the surface normal of the substrates are all the ( 001 ) .
the lattice constant of ysz is 5.142   , very close to the 5.144    value for euo at room temperature .
the lattice constant of mgo is 4.21 .@xcite prior to growth the substrates were annealed _ in situ _ at @xmath13c in an oxygen atmosphere of @xmath14 mbar for at least 120 min in the case of ysz , and in @xmath15 mbar for at least 60 min for mgo , in order to obtain clean and well  ordered substrate surfaces .
the substrates were kept at @xmath16c during growth .
the mbe facility is supplied with the ek35r reflection high  energy electron diffraction ( rheed ) system from staib instruments for _ in situ _ and _ online _ monitoring of the growth .
the mbe facility is attached to an ultra  high  vacuum @xmath17metal photoemission chamber equipped with a scienta ses100 electron energy analyzer and a vacuum generators twin crystal monochromatized al@xmath18 ( @xmath19 = 1486.6  ev ) source for _ in situ _ x  ray photoelectron spectroscopic ( xps ) analysis .
the overall energy resolution was set to 0.35 ev and the fermi level @xmath20 was calibrated using a polycrystalline au reference .
the @xmath17metal chamber is also equipped with a vacuum generators scientific t191 rear 
view low  energy electron diffraction ( leed ) system for further _ in situ _ structural characterization .
the base pressure of the @xmath17metal chamber is 1@xmath810@xmath9 mbar , and all characterizations herein were carried out at room temperature .
the mbe facility is also connected to a separate ultra  high  vacuum chamber for the evaporation of aluminum as protective capping layer of the air  sensitive euo films .
this allows the _ ex situ _ characterizations using x 
ray reflectivity ( xrr ) , superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) , and x  ray absorption spectroscopy ( xas ) .
the thickness of the aluminum capping is about 2040  .
the xrr measurements were carried out using a siemens d5000 diffractometer .
the magnetic properties of the films were determined using a quantum design mpms  xl7 squid magnetometer .
the xas measurements were performed at the dragon beamline of the national synchrotron radiation research center ( nsrrc ) in taiwan .
the spectra were recorded using the total  electron  yield method and the photon  energy resolution at the eu @xmath21 edges ( @xmath221180  ev ) was set at @xmath23 0.6  ev .
figure  1(a ) shows the rheed photograph of the clean and annealed ysz ( 001 ) before growth , and figs .
1(b)1(e ) show the photographs after 10 min of euo growth .
the eu flux rates were 8.18.2   / min for ( b)(d ) and 4.24.3   / min for ( e)(f ) . the oxygen pressure in the chamber was @xmath24 mbar for ( b ) and @xmath25 mbar for ( c ) and ( e ) .
no oxygen was supplied into the chamber for ( d ) and ( f ) .
the ysz substrate temperature was kept at @xmath16c during growth .
the important result is that the general features of the rheed patterns did not change during growth and that they are very similar to those of the clean ysz for all eu and o growth conditions .
the distance between the streaks of the euo films is identical to that of the pure ysz , confirming that the in 
plane lattice constants of euo and ysz are very closely matched .
figure  2 shows the time dependence of the rheed intensity of the specularly reflected beam during the euo growth .
we can clearly observe oscillations which are indicative for a two  dimensional ( 2d ) layer  by  layer or frank  van der merwe growth mode .
it is surprising that there are only five to six oscillations for all deposition conditions as indicated in fig .  2 and that these oscillations even exist in the absence of oxygen in the mbe chamber .
it is important to note that the oscillation period does _ not _ depend on the oxygen pressure @xmath26 , thus also in the case of no oxygen in the chamber .
this indicates that the oxygen needed for the formation of euo must also come from the ysz substrate .
the @xmath16c substrate temperature apparently provides sufficient mobility for the oxygen ions to migrate to form at least five or six euo layers .
the oscillation period , which represents a formation of a new atomic single layer , is determined only by the eu flux rate @xmath27 : reducing it by a factor of 2 , from 8.18.2 to 4.24.3   / min , doubles the period , from 25 to 50 s.    [ t ]    leed photographs for all these films displayed a good single crystallinity .
figure  3 depicts examples for the case of no oxygen in the mbe chamber during growth . also here
we can observe a perfect ( 001 ) surface of the euo rock  salt structure , consistent with the rheed results .
the leed photographs were taken at electron beam energies of 213215  ev since lower energies did not provide stable patterns due to charging .    to investigate the implications of observing only five to six oscillations
, we also carried out photoemission experiments on those films .
figure  4 , left panel ( a ) , shows the zr  @xmath28 and eu  @xmath29 core level xps spectra which were collected at normal emission .
it can be clearly seen that the zr signal is reduced when comparing the clean ysz ( bottom curve  black ) with the euo  covered ysz ( top three curves  blue , green , and red ) .
the euo films here were grown without oxygen in the mbe chamber .
different eu flux rates and total time of growth are indicated in the figure .
it is remarkable that the euo  covered ysz spectra have very similar zr signals , and also equal eu intensity , despite the fact that the total amount of eu exposure is twice as large in the two middle curves ( green and red ) than in the top one ( blue ) .
this indicates that in the absence of oxygen in the mbe chamber , the growth of euo is limited to five to six monolayers only and that the rest of the deposited eu metal is re  evaporated back into the vacuum ( the substrate temperature is @xmath30c ) . in other words ,
the sticking coefficient for eu after the completion of five to six monolayers is reduced to zero , suggesting that oxygen transport through euo is much more difficult than in ysz .
it is also important to investigate the chemical state of the eu .
figure  4 , right panel ( b ) , depicts the o  @xmath31 and eu  @xmath32 valence band spectra together with the zr  @xmath33 , o  @xmath34 , and eu  @xmath35 core levels .
the eu @xmath32 lineshape in all the films is very characteristic for a eu@xmath36 system .
the multiplet structure typical for eu@xmath5 is not visible .
one can also observe that the o @xmath31 spectrum at 610 ev binding energy for ysz is converted into the o @xmath31 valence band at 47 ev typical for euo .
@xcite all these demonstrate that only euo has been formed , free from eu@xmath1o@xmath2 or eu@xmath2o@xmath37 contaminants .
this also means that ysz can only oxidize eu into the 2 + state , and definitely not into the 3 + .
we have also carried out take  off angle  dependent xps experiments on the films .
figure  5 shows the zr  @xmath28 and eu  @xmath29 core level xps spectra of one of the euo films of fig .
4  ( a ) collected at grazing emission , i.e. , @xmath38 with respect to the surface normal , and at normal emission .
one can clearly see that the eu signal is not significantly reduced but the zr signal has almost disappeared in the grazing  emission geometry .
since grazing emission means more surface sensitivity , this result confirms not only that the euo film is on top of the ysz substrate with negligible intermixing of the cations but also that the film is closed and flat .
figure  6 depicts the zr  @xmath28 and eu  @xmath29 core level spectra ( left panel ) , and the zr  @xmath33 , o  @xmath34 , and eu  @xmath35 core level together with o  @xmath31 and eu  @xmath32 valence band spectra ( right panel ) of euo films grown with the supply of oxygen in the mbe chamber .
various oxygen pressures have been used as indicated in the figure .
the eu flux rate and the deposition time are identical for these films .
one can clearly observe that the zr  @xmath28 signal is getting smaller when the oxygen pressure is increased , indicating that the thickness of the euo film becomes larger .
the lineshapes of the eu  @xmath29 and eu  @xmath32 levels are those of divalent eu for pressures up to 12@xmath810@xmath12 mbar . for a pressure of 12@xmath810@xmath12 mbar or higher ,
however , the eu  @xmath29 and eu  @xmath32 spectral shapes start to change and show characteristics which indicate the presence of trivalent eu . apparently , for a eu flux rate of 8.2
 / min and substrate temperature of @xmath30c , 1012@xmath810@xmath12 mbar is the critical oxygen pressure below which euo films can be made on ysz ( 001 ) free from any eu@xmath1o@xmath2 or eu@xmath2o@xmath37 type of impurity phases .
we have also measured the photoemission spectra of these euo films under grazing take  off angle conditions .
again , the eu @xmath29 core level and eu @xmath32 valence band spectra are all 2 + as long as the oxygen pressures in the mbe chamber are below the critical 1012@xmath810@xmath12 mbar value .
one example is shown in fig .  7 , where an oxygen pressure of @xmath24 mbar was used .
this figure demonstrates that also the surface region of the films is free from eu@xmath5 species .
it is interesting to compare the grazing with the normal emission spectra and also with the spectra displayed in fig .
one can clearly see in fig .
7 that the zr  @xmath28 signal is very much suppressed in grazing emission , even more suppressed than in the grazing emission spectrum of fig .
this shows that the euo films grown with the supply of oxygen in the mbe chamber are thicker , a not so surprising and yet very consistent observation since without oxygen we have found that the euo film growth is limited to five to six monolayers .
the following picture can now be drawn about the initial stages of growth of euo film on ysz ( 001 ) . in case
there is no oxygen in the mbe chamber , ysz is supplying all the oxygen required to form euo .
the film is perfectly free from eu@xmath5 species . in case oxygen
is present in the mbe chamber , ysz is supplying only the amount of oxygen that is needed to complete the formation of euo .
this also explains why the growth rate of the first five to six monolayers is determined only by the eu flux rate and is totally independent of the supply of oxygen pressure in the mbe chamber , see fig .
it is important that the pressure is kept below the critical value of 1012@xmath810@xmath12 mbar as we will discuss in more detail in sec .
[ four ] .    based on the comprehensive set of rheed , leed , and xps data ,
including the rheed intensity oscillations , we have now demonstrated that euo thin films can be grown epitaxially in a layer  by  layer fashion with good control of its chemical state .
the supply of oxygen from the ysz does not do any harm , and in fact , it can be utilized as a welcoming method to calibrate the eu flux rate accurately , e.g. , the 8.18.2  / min from the quartz crystal monitor corresponds to the growth of one monolayer euo per 25 s.
having shown that the initial stages of growth of euo on ysz ( 001 ) can be made quite perfect , we now investigate whether thicker euo films can be prepared while keeping the epitaxy and , especially , the layer  by  layer growth mode .
we therefore have grown films for longer deposition times , e.g. , between 100 and 200 min , using a series of finely intervalled pressures for the oxygen , e.g. , 4 , 8 , 10 , 12 , and 16 @xmath39 mbar .
the eu flux rates were kept at 8.08.3   / min .
the resulting thickness of the films varies between roughly 300 and 800    as will be discussed later .
the rheed and leed results are plotted in fig .
one can clearly see that excellent epitaxial growth has been achieved for ( a ) 4 , ( b ) 8 , and ( c ) 10 @xmath39 mbar oxygen pressures . for 12 @xmath39 mbar ( d ) or higher pressures , however , the appearance of additional spots in the rheed indicates that the surface structure starts to change , and the absence of a pattern in the leed even suggests appreciable surface roughness .
the leed photographs were taken at electron beam energies of 368370  ev since lower energies did not provide stable patterns due to charging .    as discussed in sec  [ three ] ,
the initial five to six oscillations of the specular reflected rheed beam intensity are a unique feature for the initial stages of euo growth on the ysz ( 001 ) .
these initial oscillations do always occur , i.e. , independent of the oxygen pressure in the mbe chamber , unless the pressure exceeds a critical value above which trivalent eu species are formed .
remarkable is that no more oscillations can be observed beyond these five to six when growing thicker films .
this is the case for a wide range of oxygen pressures .
there is one exception : for a pressure of @xmath40 mbar , we were able to see further rheed intensity oscillations .
figure  9 shows that the initial five to six oscillations are then followed by at least 50 more oscillations .
it demonstrates that a layer  by  layer growth mode for euo is possible during the sustained growth .
interestingly , the oscillation period during the sustained growth is similar and yet a little bit larger than during the initial stages of growth : 30 s against 25 s. apparently , the oxygen pressure must be close to and yet a little less than the critical value in order to maintain the layer  by  layer growth mode , while the eu flux determines the growth rate in the initial stages , i.e. 8.08.2   / min eu flux corresponding to 25 s. per euo layer , it is the limited oxygen supply from the mbe environment which dictates the speed during the sustained growth , i.e. , to 30 s per euo layer .    to elucidate further the growth process , we have measured the thickness of the films using _
ex situ _ xrr measurements .
since euo deteriorates rapidly under ambient conditions , the films need to be capped . to this end ,
an aluminum layer with a thickness of 2040    has been evaporated on top of the euo .
this thickness turns out to be sufficient for the aluminum to be a good protective overlayer as will be discussed later .
figure  10 exhibits the xrr profile of the euo film which was grown at an oxygen pressure of 4@xmath810@xmath12 mbar for 200 min .
the corresponding rheed and leed patterns of the euo film are displayed in fig .
8(a ) . from the period of interference fringes
, we deduce that the thickness of the euo film is about 350   .
thicknesses of the other films are also determined from their xrr profiles .
the results are displayed in fig .
11 , where we plot the thickness against the product of oxygen pressure and total deposition time . for oxygen pressure
up to @xmath41 mbar we can observe a clear and direct linear relationship between them , strongly suggesting that the thickness is determined by the amount of oxygen incorporated .
in other words , the growth is limited by the amount of oxygen made available .
this in turn means that the eu flux rate is higher than necessary and that the excess eu must be re  evaporated into the vacuum .
figure  11 essentially confirms the distillation process needed to maintain good control of the stoichiometry as reported in our earlier studies by steeneken _
et  al_.@xcite and tjeng _ et  al_.@xcite    we now investigate to what extent the growth conditions affect the magnetic properties of the euo films using a squid magnetometer .
the results are shown in fig .
the films grown with 4 , 8 , 8.5 , and 10 @xmath39 mbar oxygen pressures all have a curie temperature of 69 k with a magnetic moment of 7  @xmath6/f.u . as expected for a @xmath7 system .
the inset shows the field dependence of the magnetization at 5  k for the film grown with a @xmath42 mbar oxygen pressure . here
one can observe a hysteresis behavior with a saturation magnetization of 7@xmath6 .
these results are in agreement with the rheed and leed results as displayed in figs .
8(a)8(c ) , in the sense that the proper ferromagnetic properties are always maintained as long as good epitaxial growth is also achieved .
on the other hand , films grown with 12 and @xmath43 mbar have completely lost their ferromagnetic properties .
it is remarkable that exceeding the @xmath40 mbar value just a little bit causes such a dramatic change .
this very abrupt change is also consistent with the rheed and leed results as displayed in fig .
8  ( d ) .
considerable film roughness starts to develop for oxygen pressures higher than @xmath40 mbar .
we would like to infer that having only a @xmath0 of about 69  k is not a sufficient characteristic to conclude that the film is homogeneous and stoichiometric .
one also needs to establish that the film has a full saturation magnetization of 7@xmath6 .
the measurement of the magnetic properties can therefore serve as a critical test for the growth conditions and in particular , the oxygen stoichiometry of the euo films .
we have also performed _
ex situ _ soft xas measurements at the eu @xmath21 edges to examine the integrity of the euo films after capping with the aluminum overlayer .
figure  13 depicts the xas spectra together with the theoretical spectra for eu@xmath36 ( top ) and eu@xmath5 ( bottom).@xcite it is clear that the eu spectra are very similar to the theoretical spectrum for eu@xmath36 , meaning that the euo films with 4 , 8 , and 10 @xmath39 mbar oxygen pressures are completely free from eu@xmath5 species .
this in turn implies that an aluminum overlayer as thin as 2040    works well to protect the euo films against air , contrary to the claims made elsewhere that one needs very thick capping layers.@xcite we attribute this to the fact that the epitaxial growth of euo on ysz ( 001 ) yields such a smooth film so that a very thin aluminum film is sufficient to make a closed capping overlayer .
the smoothness of the films as well as the complete absence of eu@xmath5 impurities forms a good starting point for the fabrication of well  defined interfaces with other metals or oxide materials , thereby opening up new opportunities to study or even generate new phenomena related to interface physics .
we conclude that the critical oxygen pressure is around 1012@xmath39 mbar for a 8.08.3  / min eu flux rate . only below this pressure
one has the distillation process taking place so that good epitaxial growth can be achieved with the proper stoichiometry and ferromagnetic properties .
apparently , layer  by  layer growth can be obtained only if one is close to , but not exceeding , the critical pressure .
[ b ]    having understood the growth process of euo on ysz ( 001 ) , and having found the recipe to obtain excellent epitaxial growth of euo on ysz ( 001 ) , we now turn our attention to the preparation of euo on mgo ( 001 ) .
mgo as a substrate for euo is interesting since several studies@xcite have reported good epitaxial growth despite the very large lattice mismatch of about 20% .
the rheed and leed photographs of euo films grown on mgo using different oxygen pressures are displayed in fig .
euo films with oxygen pressure below 10@xmath810@xmath12 mbar all show excellent epitaxial growth .
the relationship between the distances of the mgo and euo streaks is consistent with the ratio of their lattice constants of 1.22 . on the other hand ,
a higher oxygen pressure creates additional spots in the rheed image and even causes the leed pattern to disappear .
similar to the euo on ysz case , this indicates that 1012@xmath810@xmath12 is the critical value for the oxygen pressure above which one no longer gets crystalline and stoichiometric euo .
our attempts to observe rheed intensity oscillations of euo films grown on mgo ( 001 ) were yet unsuccessful .
the rheed streaks and specular spot suddenly disappeared right after the deposition of euo has been initiated . in approximately 30 s , new streak lines appear , whose spacing conforms to the euo lattice parameter
. however , the specular spot was never recovered .
a more detailed growth study is required to determine the growth process of euo on mgo ( 001 ) .    to investigate the quality of these euo films in terms of their magnetic properties ,
we have performed squid measurement for films grown with oxygen pressures of 8 , 10 , and 12@xmath810@xmath12 mbar .
the results are shown in fig .  15 .
similar to the euo on ysz case , the films that were grown below 10@xmath810@xmath12 mbar have a curie temperature of 69  k with a magnetic moment close to 7@xmath6/f.u .
conversely , the film grown under a higher oxygen pressure has completely lost its ferromagnetic character .
the small peak at roughly 5  k indicates the typical antiferromagnetic ordering temperature of eu@xmath2o@xmath37 , meaning that the dramatic loss of the ferromagnetism for the growth using slightly above the critical oxygen pressure is due to the presence of eu@xmath5 species .
we have successfully grown epitaxial and highly stoichiometric euo films on ysz ( 001 ) .
the initial stages of growth involve the limited supply of oxygen from the ysz substrate , but the euo stoichiometry can still be well maintained .
we have also observed rheed intensity oscillations during the sustained stages of growth , which demonstrate that the layer  by  layer growth mode can be achieved for euo films on ysz ( 001 ) .
the euo films were sufficiently smooth so that capping with a thin layer of aluminum enabled _ ex situ _ experiments free from trivalent eu species . the excellent epitaxial growth of euo films is always accompanied by
equally excellent ferromagnetic properties : a saturation magnetization of 7@xmath6 and a @xmath0 of 69 k. we have also confirmed that the use of the eu  distillation process during the mbe  assisted growth enables the consistent achievement of stoichiometry .
the layer  by  layer growth , the smoothness of the film , and the excellent stoichiometry provide an excellent basis for the fabrication of well  defined interfaces for further studies .

* 6 * , 882 ( 2007 ) ." ," we have succeeded in growing epitaxial and highly stoichiometric films of euo on yttria  stabilized cubic zirconia ( ysz ) ( 001 ) . 
 the use of the eu  distillation process during the molecular beam epitaxy assisted growth enables the consistent achievement of stoichiometry . 
 we have also succeeded in growing the films in a layer  by  layer fashion by fine tuning the eu vs. oxygen deposition rates . 
 the initial stages of growth involve the limited supply of oxygen from the ysz substrate , but the euo stoichiometry can still be well maintained . 
 the films grown were sufficiently smooth so that the capping with a thin layer of aluminum was leak tight and enabled _ ex situ _ experiments free from trivalent eu species . 
 the findings were used to obtain recipes for better epitaxial growth of euo on mgo ( 001 ) . "
"in high energy collisions the partons inside hadrons form a very dense system which is often called the color glass condensate . at sufficiently high density
the partons overlap such that recombination effects become important and tend to slow down the growth of the density with increasing energy .
it is expected that eventually a saturation regime is reached .
the theoretical challenge is to understand at which energies and how this takes place in detail . in order to answer this question one formulates evolution equations describing the behavior of the system with increasing energy .
the color glass condensate has been studied in a number of different perturbative approaches which are applicable if the scattering process involves a hard scale .
prominent examples are the approach initiated by mclerran and venugopalan @xcite ( for a review see @xcite ) , the operator expansion of wilson lines due to balitsky @xcite , or the color dipole picture of high energy scattering developed by mueller @xcite .
most of these approaches lead to similar results in suitable approximations .
they all reproduce for example the balitsky - kovchegov ( bk ) evolution equation which resums certain classes of multi - pomeron exchanges @xcite , and which has become a key tool in investigating the color glass condensate and in particular potential saturation effects at high energies .
the approach which we will use in the present paper is the generalized leading logarithmic approximation ( glla ) @xcite-@xcite .
it is an extension of the classical approach to high energy scattering in qcd based on the resummation of large logarithms that in leading logarithmic order ( lla ) gives rise to the bfkl pomeron @xcite .
the bfkl pomeron can be viewed as the exchange of two interacting reggeized gluons . in the glla
one goes beyond that approximation by taking into account also exchanges of more than two gluons , and one collects all perturbative contributions that contain the maximally possible number of logarithms for a given number of gluons .
there are two versions of the glla : in the first version the number of gluons exchanged in the @xmath6-channel of the scattering process remains constant , whereas in the second version the number of gluons is allowed to change during the @xmath6-channel evolution @xcite .
the latter is often called extended glla , or eglla .
it is the fluctuation of the number of gluons in the @xmath6-channel which in the resummation approach reflects the parton recombination effects characterizing the color glass condensate .
different aspects of the eglla have been studied in @xcite-@xcite . there
it has been found that in the pomeron channel , i.e.  for the exchange of even @xmath7-parity , the eglla gives rise to a picture of an effective field theory in which states consisting of even numbers of gluons are coupled to each other via effective vertices .
so far the vertices from two to four @xcite and from two to six gluons @xcite have been calculated explicitly . from the two - to - four gluon vertex
one obtains the perturbative triple pomeron vertex @xcite , and in a similar way the one - to - three pomeron vertex is obtained from the two - to - six gluon vertex @xcite .
recently it has been shown that the triple pomeron vertex obtained in this way gives rise to the bk equation when the so - called mbius representation is used for the pomerons @xcite .
as discussed in that reference the eglla not only reproduces the bk equation but also makes it possible to compute subleading corrections to the bk equation which appear difficult to access in other approaches to the color glass condensate .
an advantage of the eglla is that the remarkable property of conformal invariance in two - dimensional impact parameter space @xcite and the phenomenon of gluon reggeization @xcite become particularly transparent in this approach .
especially the reggeization of the gluon will turn out to be crucial in our present investigation .
the gluons exchanged in high energy scattering are reggeized , that is they are composite objects consisting themselves of reggeized gluons in a selfconsistent way .
a manifestation of this phenomenon is that whenever two @xmath6-channel gluons are at the same point in impact parameter space they behave like a single gluon .
when this occurs explicitly in a scattering amplitude we can hence see how the composite gluon is formed out of the two gluons .
the same picture can be extended to more than two gluons , and one can systematically resolve higher fock states of the reggeized gluon in the framework of the eglla , see @xcite .
so far the color glass condensate has been studied almost exclusively in the pomeron channel , that is for the exchange of vacuum quantum numbers ( in particular for positive @xmath7-parity ) which is relevant to total cross sections . in the present paper
we make a first step of a systematic study of the odderon in the eglla , that is for the channel in which negative charge parity quantum number is exchanged . in lowest order in the glla
the odderon is an exchange of three interacting gluons in the @xmath6-channel in a symmetric color state , and is described by the bartels - kwieciski - praszaowicz ( bkp ) equation @xcite .
two types of explicit solutions to the bkp equation have been found in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .
the latter solution has also been found in the dipole picture of high energy scattering in @xcite where also some potential effects of the color glass condensate on the odderon are discussed . for a review of the theory and phenomenology of the odderon see @xcite .
our motivation for studying also the odderon in the eglla is twofold .
firstly , states with more than three gluons in the @xmath6-channel might be important phenomenologically .
one could for example expect that pomeron loops can affect the odderon intercept
. recall that the intercept of the perturbative odderon is close to one ( and exactly one for the solution of @xcite ) .
hence potential corrections to the intercept due to pomerons would be particularly significant .
another interesting effect is the interplay of pomeron and odderon exchanges in high energy scattering .
some possible effects of that interplay have recently been discussed in @xcite .
a detailed study certainly requires a concise knowledge of the splitting of an odderon into an odderon and a pomeron , as it can be obtained in the eglla .
the calculation of that vertex is among the goals of the investigation that we initiate in the present paper .
we expect that this vertex will also make it possible to obtain the large-@xmath8 limit of the eglla and thus give rise to an equation for the odderon channel which is the analog of the bk equation for the pomeron channel .
this equation should then be of a similar form as the one suggested in the context of saturation in the dipole picture for the odderon in @xcite .
an equally important motivation for studying the odderon in the eglla is to gain a better understanding of the effective theory of the color glass condensate and of its properties .
important aspects in this respect would for instance be an investigation of the crossing properties of the vertices in the effective field theory and their interpretation in view of conformal field theories .
in addition , studying odderon states will hopefully also make it possible to compute the gluon vertices of the effective field theory  which so far are known only for color singlet channels  in arbitrary color states .    in a first step we consider in the present paper the case of up to four gluons .
we give explicitly the coupled evolution equations for the three- and four - gluon states . as an initial condition for the evolution we choose the coupling of the odderon to the @xmath0 impact factor .
this impact factor can be computed in perturbation theory due to the large mass of the charm quark .
it is also of phenomenological relevance , see for example @xcite-@xcite .
we will show that the impact factor exhibits reggeization . that fact will make it possible to find an explicit solution of the evolution equation for the four - gluon state when it is coupled to the @xmath0 impact factor . due to that impact factor ,
the odderon solution found in @xcite is projected out .
we will show that an analogous result can be obtained for the solution of @xcite by considering the case of a baryonic impact factor .
as we will discuss in the conclusions , our result lays the foundations for a future investigation of the five - gluon odderon state in which we expect new elements of the effective field theory to occur .    we should mention that odderon states with more than three gluons have already been discussed in the glla , but only with the number of gluons being kept fixed during the evolution .
there a remarkable simplification takes place in the large-@xmath8 limit in which these @xmath9-gluon states are equivalent to an integrable xxx heisenberg model @xcite-@xcite .
it should be pointed out , however , that for @xmath10 the @xmath9-gluon states obtained in the large-@xmath8 limit are not the leading ones at high energies .
moreover , they can not be coupled directly to the phenomenologically interesting impact factors , as will become clear also in our discussion below .
we emphasize that in the present paper we do not fix the number of gluons in the @xmath6-channel evolution , and also do not take the large-@xmath8 limit .
the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : eveq ] we formulate the evolution equations for the @xmath9-gluon odderon states in the eglla .
we then compute the @xmath11-odderon impact factor with an arbitrary number @xmath9 of gluons ( @xmath12 ) and give the result explicitly for the cases of four and five gluons .
the result is expressed in terms of the impact factor with only three gluons .
based on that observation we are then able to find an analytic solution of the four - gluon odderon state in the eglla and discuss its properties in section [ sec : solution ] . in section [ sec : jw ] we generalize our result to other impact factors and hence to all known types of odderon solutions .
our results are summarized in section [ sec : summary ] .
in the course of our calculation we also find some useful results for the @xmath7-even channel which we present in an appendix .
we start with the well - known bkp equation for a system of three interacting gluons exchanged in the @xmath6-channel of a scattering process @xcite . in the case of the odderon the three gluons are in a state that is odd under @xmath7-parity .
we consider the odderon amplitude coupled to the @xmath0 impact factor , which hence constitutes the initial condition for the evolution of the odderon state in rapidity .
we define @xmath13 as the amputated three - gluon odderon amplitude with discontinuities taken in the squared energies obtained from the four - momenta of the photon and the first gluon , and of the photon and the first and second gluon , respectively . at high energies ,
the dynamics effectively reduces to the transverse plane of the reaction , see section [ simpfacrep ] below .
the amplitude @xmath13 accordingly depends on the transverse momenta of the three gluons , and it obviously carries color labels for the gluons . in addition , @xmath13 depends on the momenta of the photon and the @xmath14-meson , but we will suppress this dependence in our notation . it is convenient to change from the squared center - of - mass energy @xmath15 to complex angular momentum @xmath16 via a sommerfeld - watson transformation .
the bkp equation in transverse momentum space then reads @xmath17 with the gluon trajectory function @xmath18 describing virtual corrections to the @xmath6-channel gluons , @xmath19 where the bold - face characters denote two - dimensional transverse momenta .
the bkp equation can be viewed as a schrdinger type equation with @xmath16 being the energy - like variable .
the conjugate time - like variable is rapidity @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is a fixed hadronic energy scale .
the kernel @xmath22 describes the pairwise interaction of the gluons .
it is up to a color factor identical to the part of the integral kernel of the bfkl equation which describes real gluon production .
we will give an explicit representation of the kernel as well as an explanation of the convolution symbol further below .
in the case of three gluons one can separate the color and the momentum part , @xmath23 with the symmetric structure constant @xmath24 of the @xmath25 color group .
we will sometimes suppress the momentum arguments of the function @xmath13 .
the inhomogeneous term @xmath26 in the bkp equation ( [ inteqf3 ] ) is given by the impact factor of the transition @xmath0 .
we refer the reader to @xcite for the explicit formula for the impact factor with three gluons .
its explicit form will not be needed for our discussion .
we only note here that the impact factor @xmath26 is symmetric in the three gluon momenta and in their color labels , and that it vanishes due to gauge invariance when one of the gluon momenta vanishes .
it should be pointed out that our particular choice of the @xmath0 impact factor singles out a particular solution to the bkp equation , namely the bartels - lipatov - vacca ( blv ) solution @xcite .
that solution is a superposition of states depending only on two transverse coordinates .
in contrast to that situation , the other known class of solutions of the bkp equation requires the three gluons to be at different positions in transverse space and vanishes when two of the three gluon positions coincide .
( the janik - wosiek solution found in @xcite belongs to this class . ) in the @xmath0 impact factor in leading order the photon splits into a quark - antiquark pair to which the three gluons couple , and which then recombines into an @xmath14 meson .
the intermediate state with only two quarks provides only two points in transverse space to which the gluons couple and hence singles out the blv solution .
we will first concentrate on that solution and will come back to the other class of solutions in section [ sec : jw ] .
the symmetry of the impact factor mentioned above immediately allows us to find a crucial property of the full three - gluon amplitude without even using the particular form of the blv solution , namely the separate invariance of the amplitude under exchange of the momenta and of the color indices .
the latter observation is trivial because of the color tensor @xmath24 which the odderon keeps throughout its evolution .
the invariance under momentum - exchange can be inferred from the bkp equation ( [ inteqf3 ] ) as the quark loop has this property and the application of the integral kernel respects the symmetry because the sum over all pairwise interactions is performed . formally constructing
the solution by iterating the integral equation then leads to the conclusion that this property transfers to the full three - gluon odderon amplitude .
of course , this symmetry property is also reflected in the explicit formula of the blv solution , see @xcite .
later we will need only a slightly weaker property of the three - gluon odderon state , namely its symmetry under simultaneous exchange of momentum and color labels which is a trivial consequence of the separate symmetries in color and momentum space . in a similar way one can start from the fact that the impact factor vanishes for vanishing gluon momenta and
derive that also the full amplitude @xmath13 vanishes if one of the three gluon momenta vanishes .
we now want to write the bkp equation in a diagrammatic form in order to make the generalization to higher gluon numbers more transparent , @xmath27 in this notation , the diagrams representing the impact factor and the full odderon amplitude include the color tensors and the contributions from the external particles , but are amputated , i.e.  the ` outgoing ' gluon propagators are cut off .
the kernel that acts on the amplitude also includes color tensors which we give explicitly below .
the sum in the last term extends over all pairwise interactions of the gluons .
it is now straightforward to apply the eglla to the @xmath7-odd channel following the same procedure which has been developed in @xcite for the @xmath7-even ( pomeron ) channel .
the lowest possible contribution in the @xmath7-odd channel is the odderon with three gluons satisfying the bkp equation , see above . in the eglla , we have to take into account in addition all exchanges with more than three gluons , and have to allow for number - changing transitions during the evolution .
this is most conveniently implemented in the form of integral equations that generalize the bkp equation .
( for a detailed discussion of the corresponding integral equations in the @xmath7-even channel see @xcite . ) in these integral equations the number - changing transitions are due to integral kernels @xmath28 which have been derived in @xcite .
note that as a result of the approximation scheme of the eglla in these kernels only two gluons interact with each other to produce more @xmath6-channel gluons .
this is similar to the bkp equation ( [ inteqf3 ] ) , where in each contribution to the last term only two gluons undergo an interaction via the bfkl kernel . in the amplitude for an @xmath9-gluon state one then has to take into account all possible contributions in which a state with @xmath29 gluons ( @xmath30 ) undergoes a transition to an @xmath9-gluon state via a kernel @xmath28 with @xmath31 , and we have to include all possible @xmath29 starting from the lowest possible amplitude that has @xmath32 . for us
it is important that the derivation @xcite of the kernels @xmath28 for the interaction of two gluons does not require any assumptions about the other gluons , in particular it does not require a specific @xmath7-parity of the whole @xmath9-gluon state .
we can therefore use exactly the same kernels to formulate the integral equations for @xmath9-gluon amplitudes also in the @xmath7-odd channel .    in this way one obtains the following integral equation for the @xmath7-odd four - gluon amplitude @xmath33 in the eglla , @xmath34 which in diagrammatic notation reads : @xmath35
one can easily construct also the equations for the higher @xmath9-gluon amplitudes @xmath36 , again in complete analogy to the case of even @xmath7-parity . for @xmath37 ,
for example , the equation reads @xmath38 in this way one obtains the full ( infinite ) hierarchy of coupled integral equations of the eglla for the @xmath7-odd channel .    to complete the account of the integral equations for the @xmath7-odd channel in eglla
, we have to give the exact expression for the interaction kernels .
as the @xmath39 kernels can be written in a general form , we can do this in one step for both kernels that appear up to the four - gluon equation .
let the two gluons that enter the kernel from above carry the transverse momenta @xmath40 and @xmath41 and the color labels @xmath42 and @xmath43 , and let the @xmath44 outgoing gluons carry the momenta @xmath45 and the color labels @xmath46 .
the integral kernels for the transition of two to @xmath44 gluons then read @xcite ( the generalization to arbitrary indices being trivial ) @xmath47\ , .
\end{split}\ ] ] for the @xmath48 kernel ( @xmath49 ) the last term in the brackets is defined to be zero so that one gets the bfkl kernel without the virtual corrections .
finally , the convolution symbol @xmath50 implies a factor @xmath51^{-1}$ ] followed by an integration @xmath52 over the loop momentum .
clearly , there is a color factor @xmath53 for every gluon that does not participate in the kernel interaction .    as in the case of @xmath7-even exchanges ,
the integral equations of the eglla as described above apply to cut amplitudes .
the four - gluon amplitude @xmath33 , for example , is a result of taking three discontinuities with respect to the energy variables obtained from the photon and the first @xmath54 gluons , @xmath55 .
it should be noted that , as a result of these discontinuities , the amplitude @xmath33 is not fully symmetric under the exchange of two gluons .
the full bose symmetry of the @xmath9-gluon states is only restored in the full amplitude reconstructed via dispersion relations . instead
, the cut amplitudes for which the integral equations are formulated obey a particular set of ward - type identities found in @xcite for the @xmath7-even channel . as we will discuss below , our result for @xmath33 satisfies these identities .
finally , a remark is in order concerning the calculation of scattering amplitudes from the amplitudes @xmath36 of our integral equations . in order to calculate the amplitude for the quasidiffractive process @xmath56 for three @xmath6-channel gluons
, one would have to fold the solution of the bkp equation ( [ inteqf3 ] ) simply with the lower impact factor after attaching simple gluon propagators ( without interaction ) to it as is illustrated in figure [ famplgen ] below ( see also @xcite ) .
however , for the higher gluon number odderon equations such a simple reconstruction of the full scattering amplitude must fail , because the integral equation also includes the transition from three to four @xmath6-channel gluons but not the other way around , which would lead to an asymmetric treatment of the upper and lower impact factor .
simply taking the square of the result is also not possible because it would double count some of the contributions . in fact , the reconstruction of the physical amplitude for the process @xmath56 from the solution @xmath36 of the integral equations for general @xmath9 is a nontrivial task and requires a very careful use of dispersion relations in order to undo the cuts applied to the amplitude .
a detailed discussion of this problem is beyond the scope of the present paper .
when considering other scattering processes like for example photon - proton scattering , however , the coupling of the four - gluon system directly to the scattering partner is easier and does not lead to the problems mentioned above .
[ sec : impfac ]    we now turn to the calculation of the @xmath0 impact factor with an arbitrary number @xmath57 of gluons coupled to it in glla . due to the quantum numbers of the photon and of the @xmath14 meson the @xmath9 gluons are always in a @xmath7-odd state
.    it will be useful to recall first in a more general setting the factorization of scattering processes at high energies which gives rise to impact factors .
after discussing the @xmath0 impact factor with three gluons we will then consider more gluons .
for that the crucial point is to study the step from @xmath9 to @xmath58 gluons , that is the effect of attaching one additional gluon to the impact factor .
we show that the corresponding diagrams with @xmath58 gluons can be expressed in terms of diagrams with @xmath9 gluons in a particular way . that step has been considered more or less explicitly in many studies before
( see for example @xcite ) , but we find it useful to discuss it here in more detail in a notation suitable for our purposes . using that result and taking into account the color algebra we are then able to find a general formula for our impact factor with @xmath9 gluons in terms of the three - gluon impact factor .
let us consider the scattering amplitude for a perturbatively calculable process at high energies in the glla . to be specific , we choose the quasidiffractive process @xmath59 , but the discussion also holds for other processes . in the following derivation of the impact factor representation for the scattering amplitude
we follow @xcite ( where the analysis was conducted for the qed case , i.e.  photon exchange ) and @xcite ( where the two - gluon qcd case is treated ) .    at high energies
the scattering process is dominated by gluon exchange , the lowest order contribution being three - gluon exchange for the process under consideration .
let us first concentrate on the simple case in which the three gluons do not interact with each other , as illustrated in figure [ famplitude ] .
we can write the corresponding amplitude as @xmath60 where @xmath61 is a combinatorial factor and @xmath62 and @xmath62 stand for the upper and lower shaded parts of the figure , respectively .
these vertex functions also include the color factors and the contribution of the external particles .
explicitly writing out the arguments of these functions for the case of incident photons , we have @xmath63 the minus signs in front of the gluon momenta in the term @xmath64 arise because an incoming momentum in the upper vertex is treated as outgoing in the lower vertex and vice versa .
the polarization vectors @xmath65 and @xmath66 of the incident photons will not be relevant in our discussion and will therefore not be written explicitly below .
the three gluon momenta are related to the momentum transfer via @xmath67 , and @xmath68 .
now we perform a sudakov decomposition of the momenta by splitting each four - momentum into its components parallel to the two light - like four - vectors @xmath69 and @xmath70 that have antiparallel three - momentum directions , and the remaining transverse part .
for example , the vector @xmath71 is decomposed into @xmath72 in high - energy collisions we can assume that the invariant masses are negligible compared to @xmath15 .
hence @xmath73 and we can use the incident photon momenta for the decomposition also in the case of virtual photons
. we will always denote by @xmath74 the sudakov component belonging to the upper incident momentum @xmath69 , and by @xmath18 the one belonging to @xmath70 .
the integration measure can then be rewritten as @xmath75 furthermore , the transferred momenta are predominantly transverse ( as was shown for the qed case in @xcite ) , hence the denominator of a gluon propagator can be simplified to @xmath76 also the metric tensor @xmath77 can be divided into longitudinal and transverse parts , @xmath78    after the convolution with the vertex functions @xmath62 and @xmath64 , the large contributions arise from the terms in which the momentum of the lower incident particle is contracted with the upper vertex , and vice versa .
phrased differently , one finds that the longitudinal gluon polarizations dominate in the high energy limit .
we can therefore substitute @xmath79 and obtain the amplitude in impact factor representation , @xmath80 with the impact factors being @xmath81 the integrals can be disentangled here because the @xmath74-parameters of the gluons can be neglected in @xmath82 ( they are small compared to the @xmath74-parameters of the quark lines ) , and likewise for the @xmath18-parameters in the lower vertex .    the above considerations are easily generalized to more sophisticated exchanges in which the @xmath6-channel gluons interact with each other as is shown in figure [ famplgen ]
.    -channel gluon interaction.,width=264 ]    also here the dominant contributions come from the longitudinally polarized gluons and the resulting impact factors are exactly the same as above .
the resulting amplitude can be written symbolically as @xmath83 in that general case the matrix element symbol stands for the integration over all undetermined momenta of the scattering amplitude  that is , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 ( the third gluon s momentum is fixed by the total momentum transfer ) .
it also includes a factor @xmath88 as in the simple case discussed above .
* g * denotes the green function of the three - gluon exchange in transverse space . in this picture the simple three - gluon exchange process ( fig .
[ famplitude ] ) is reproduced by setting @xmath89    it is also straightforward to generalize the derivation of the impact factors to exchanges with an arbitrary number of gluons in the @xmath6-channel . from the formulae above one
can easily read off the factors and integrations which have to be associated with each additional gluon .
let us now collect some basics of color algebra for the gauge group su(@xmath8 ) .
its lie algebra has @xmath90 generators @xmath91 that satisfy the algebra @xmath92=i f_{abc } t^c\ ] ] with the antisymmetric structure constants @xmath93 .
the anti - commutator of two generators defines the symmetric structure constants @xmath94 , @xmath95 note that we write the structure constants with lower indices .
sometimes we will use the so - called ` bird track ' notation to illustrate color tensor contractions diagrammatically .
the antisymmetric structure constants are drawn as a solid black circles and the color indices are written counterclockwise : @xmath96{f_abc } }    \picraise=-0.5\ht0    \advance\picraise by 0.5\dp0    \advance\picraise by 3pt        \hbox{\raise\picraise \box0 } } \,.\ ] ] then for example the nontrivial part of the color tensor of the @xmath97 kernel in ( [ 2tomkernel ] ) is given by @xmath98 the color tensors for the integral kernels are drawn in such a way that the color indices @xmath99 , which are to be contracted with the color labels of the amplitudes in the integral equations , are at the top of the diagram .
it is convenient to define the tensors @xmath100.\end{aligned}\ ] ] note that these definitions do not coincide with the structure constants for @xmath101 .
in fact , the structure constants are given in terms of these tensors by @xmath102      next we want to review some important properties of the @xmath0 impact factor with three gluons attached to it which was first calculated in @xcite .
three is the lowest possible number of gluons in the @xmath6-channel for which that impact factor exists .
the @xmath0 impact factor for three gluons consists of eight diagrams corresponding to the @xmath103 choices for the way in which the gluons couple to the the quark or antiquark .
( recall that due to the cuts applied to the amplitude the gluons do not cross each other . ) one of these diagrams is shown in figure [ famplitudediag ] .
impact factor with three gluons.,width=226 ]    most of the details of the analytic expression for the impact factor will not be relevant for our considerations .
a key property is that the dirac structure of the coupling of the quark - antiquark pair to the @xmath14 meson is simply @xmath104 .
the coefficient of the @xmath104 factor can be related to the radiative two - photon width of the @xmath14 , see @xcite .
further , it turns out that only transverse photon polarizations give a nonvanishing contribution to the impact factor . in the following
we will often speak of the quark loop to which the odderon is coupled . unless otherwise stated this
will always assume that there is a @xmath105 matrix at the photon vertex and a @xmath104 matrix at the meson vertex .
when calculating one particular diagram ( out of the eight possible diagrams ) one encounters five quark propagators of the form @xmath106 four additional @xmath107 matrices ( three gluon vertices and the photon vertex ) and a @xmath104 coming from the @xmath14 vertex .
the gluon vertex @xmath107 matrices get contracted with the light - like vector @xmath70 from the lower impact factor ( see section [ simpfacrep ] ) .
using the fact that for light - like vectors @xmath69 the equation @xmath108 holds , one easily reduces the expression in the @xmath107 trace to a sum of terms that consist of maximally five @xmath107 s by permuting the gluon vertex @xmath107 matrices next to each other .
when performing the trace for the case of massless quarks , one clearly gets zero because of the odd number of @xmath107 matrices , and hence we need to take into account mass effects .
that allows us to choose a mass term instead of a momentum term with a @xmath107 matrix ( in the numerator of the quark propagator @xmath109 ) .
in fact , only the case in which of the five propagator terms one mass and four momenta are combined gives a non - vanishing contribution .
let us stress this point : when calculating the impact factor , exactly one propagator term must lend its mass , the others their momenta with @xmath107 matrices .
clearly , we will get a sum over the different possibilities of which propagator lends its mass , but for our purposes it will suffice to keep these considerations on a qualitative level .
another important property is the behavior of an impact factor diagram under the exchange of its quark and antiquark lines .
we can reassign the quark loop momenta in such a way that we get almost the same expression as before , apart from a minus sign for all propagator momenta in the @xmath107 trace . for three gluons
this means an overall relative _ plus _ sign because one propagator must give a mass instead of a momentum ( as we have explained above ) and the sign of the mass is not affected by the exchange .
the set of all possible impact factor diagrams can be grouped into pairs in which the two diagrams are just related to each other by such an interchange of the quark and antiquark lines .
doing so , one reduces the number of diagrams that have to be calculated by two .
this holds for the momentum and @xmath107 part only , but the interchange of the quark lines naturally also reverses the order of the @xmath110 generators .    for three gluons
we finally get four diagrams in this way , each coming together with two different traces of color matrices .
adding these two contributions one gets @xmath111 the full impact factor is then just the sum over the four different momentum diagrams together with the color tensor @xmath112 : @xmath113    the schematic notation introduced here stands symbolically for the impact factor without color factors .
the diagrams only show which gluons couple to the quark ( upper line ) and which to the antiquark ( lower line )  the overall color tensor @xmath112 is extracted but the photon and @xmath14 vertices are implied . to obtain the final result
, one needs to calculate these different diagrams .
as already said , we will not need the explicit form of the three - gluon impact factor .
but there is one property that will be very important for our considerations , namely the symmetry under exchange of its momentum arguments .
it does not hold for every contributing momentum diagram separately , but can only be seen after performing the sum over the different diagrams .
now we want to explain how an @xmath58 gluon diagram can be reduced to an @xmath9 gluon diagram
. clearly we can always find at least two gluons that are attached to the same quark line .
hence we can choose two which are separated only by one quark propagator .
the additional factors that enter  compared to the @xmath9-gluon diagram  are a gluon vertex contracted with the incident momentum of the lower impact factor @xmath70 and the additional quark propagator between the two neighboring gluon vertices .
the propagator again has a sum @xmath114 in its numerator but as the mass term is sandwiched between two factors of @xmath115 its contribution vanishes .
therefore , the addition of another gluon increases the number of @xmath107 matrices by two . to reduce the number of @xmath107 matrices in the trace , we use the same mechanism that we have already explained in the beginning of the previous section .
thereby we can always reduce the trace to one involving four @xmath107 matrices , the @xmath104 from the meson vertex , and one quark mass . in
the following we want to have a closer look at this reduction mechanism and at the factors which occur .
for that it will be important that we work with cut amplitudes , which amounts to putting the cut quark lines on - shell .
first we choose two gluons that are attached to the same quark line at neighboring vertices .
writing it in feynman diagram notation , this part of the quark loop can be represented as @xmath116 let @xmath117 be the momentum of the quark line that lies between these two vertices .
we will call the gluon further down along the line ` new ' gluon , because we understand it as an additional gluon as compared to the @xmath9-gluon amplitude . according to the cutkosky rules for calculating the discontinuity of the diagram ,
the ` new ' quark propagator term is replaced according to @xmath118 \,,\ ] ] because a quark line between two neighboring gluons is always put on shell due to the cuts .
let @xmath119 be the index of the new gluon .
the new vertex gets contracted with the momentum of the lower incident particle @xmath70 to give @xmath120 . as was explained in section [ simpfacrep ] , for every gluon
one also gets an integration over its sudakov component parallel to @xmath70 , i.e.  over @xmath121 .
putting it all together , one finds as additional factors apart from the new color trace : @xmath122 \\ = \dots i g \int d \beta_j    \operatorname{tr}(\dots ( { \slashed k}+m ) \slashed p ' \dots ) \ , \delta(k^2-m^2)\ , .
\end{split}\ ] ]    the neighboring gluon with momentum @xmath123 in ( [ 2to1 ] ) also gives a @xmath124 in the @xmath107-trace , and we can permute it with the quark line numerator and get a factor @xmath125 . by using the sudakov decomposition for the quark line , @xmath126 , this can be absorbed by the @xmath127-function , and so we get @xmath128    we now shift the integration variables @xmath129 it is clear that all the @xmath18 parameters in the quark loop apart from the ones coming from the new quark propagator can be expressed in terms of @xmath130 and the @xmath18 parameters of the other gluons and of the quark loop momentum only , which means that the only occurrence of @xmath121 is in the new propagator .
parameter of the incoming quark momentum at the left of ( [ 2to1 ] ) by @xmath131 , one easily finds @xmath132 , so one can see that @xmath121 in fact enters in the argument of the @xmath127-function .
] now the integration over @xmath121 can be performed to cancel the @xmath127-function . in pictorial notation , we are left with the following identity : @xmath133    so far we have discussed only the momentum part of one particular diagram that contributes to the odderon impact factor with @xmath58 gluons .
we also have to consider the relative sign between two diagrams that are linked by interchange of the quark and antiquark lines .
compared to the @xmath9-gluon case we have included another quark propagator and a @xmath107 matrix coming from the new gluon vertex .
independently of the number of attached gluons , always one mass term in the @xmath107 trace has to be chosen , so every new propagator gives a new relative minus sign since the momentum term changes sign under the interchange of the fermion lines .
( note that this is due to the fact that we are calculating a closed fermion loop in which the direction of the momentum flow is reversed due to the interchange of the fermion lines . ) remembering that for 3 gluons we found a relative _ plus _ sign , we easily see that the relative sign between diagrams with interchanged quark and antiquark lines is @xmath134 .
in other words , the momentum part of a diagram with an odd number of gluons is symmetric under the interchange of quark and antiquark , whereas an even number of gluons leads to an antisymmetric momentum part .
thus , we get @xmath135-type color tensors for odd numbers of attached gluons , @xmath136-type tensors for even numbers ( with a factor of @xmath137 to cancel the @xmath138 in the definition ( [ defftensor ] ) of the @xmath136 tensors ) .
we are now ready to express the @xmath58 gluon quark loop for the odderon in terms of the one with @xmath9 gluons .
the main calculation becomes clear in the step from three to four gluons .
it is then easy to proceed to higher gluon numbers .
the four - gluon impact factor consists of two color structures , each with four pairs of momentum diagrams .
the terms in which all four gluons are attached to the same fermion line , for example , give the following structure ( all traces are performed in the direction opposite to the quark lines ) : @xmath139 where we have reversed the order of the color indices of the @xmath136 tensor , which gives an additional minus sign
. for the complete four - gluon quark loop one finds the following diagrammatic representation : @xmath140    clearly , there are many possible ways of reducing the single momentum diagrams to three - gluon diagrams along the lines of the previous section .
but it is our aim to express it in terms of the full three - gluon impact factor @xmath26 .
motivated by the structure of the three - gluon @xmath141 impact factor in the @xmath7-even channel @xcite and by the general property of reggeization in the @xmath9-gluon amplitudes in that channel @xcite we now make an ansatz and show that it in fact gives the full impact factor .
the following construction leads to the correct result for the four - gluon odderon impact factor : @xmath142 \,.\ ] ] this diagrammatic notation symbolizes the contraction of the color tensor of the impact factor @xmath26 with an @xmath93 tensor .
in addition , one of the arguments of the amplitude @xmath26 is actually the sum of two gluons momenta .
we will further abbreviate this expression containing sums of two arguments and contractions with a color tensor @xmath136 in the following way : @xmath143 \star f_{(3;0)}^{b_1 b_2 b_3 } ( i j ) \,,\ ] ] where @xmath137 and @xmath119 denote the position of the two ` merging ' gluons in the four - gluon system and the same indices appear in the color tensor and in the sum of the momenta .
the star symbolizes the contraction of the color tensor ( drawn in bird track notation ) with the tensor of the amplitude @xmath144 .
the arguments of the function @xmath26 are very much simplified here .
clearly , the momenta of all gluons enter as arguments of the function , but the main point on which we focus in this notation is that the momenta of the two merged gluons enter only with their sum . to shorten the notation ,
we simply write down the indices that correspond to the merged gluons .
that notation means that , for example , f_(3;0)^b_1 b_2 b_3 ( 12 ) = f_(3;0)^b_1 b_2 b_3 ( 12,3,4 ) = f_(3;0)^b_1 b_2 b_3 ( * k*_1+*k*_2,*k*_3,*k*_4 ) . a string of indices stands for the sum of the corresponding momenta . as we have mentioned before , the three - gluon impact factor is symmetric under the exchange of its momentum arguments , so we do not need to worry about the position at which the merged gluons sum enters as long as we choose it consistently in all the specific diagrams shown in ( [ f30 ] ) . with this abbreviation of the momentum arguments , expression ( [ f40ansatz ] ) has the following explicit form , @xmath145 \ , .
\end{split}\ ] ] to prove ( [ f40ansatz ] ) one writes out all 24 diagrams of three - gluon quark loops according to ( [ f30 ] ) .
the momentum part of these diagrams is easy to handle .
a pair of gluons that couple to a quark line together is just expanded to their respective positions in the four - gluon amplitude as shown in ( [ diagreduction ] ) , corresponding to a factor @xmath146 .
two gluons that enter the antiquark line give an additional minus sign when expanded .
one might think that a problem arises when a gluon is sandwiched by two merged gluons as is the case for example in the second diagram on the right hand side of ( [ f40ansatz ] ) , because we have discussed only the case when two neighboring gluons at the same quark line reduce to one .
recall , however , that we can reduce _ all _ gluons that are attached to the same quark line to one . only the sum of the momenta of the gluons then enters the amplitude .
therefore , we can use the mechanism described above also for the general case of any two gluons attached to the same quark line .
the color part is slightly more involved , because the @xmath147 tensor of the three - gluon quark loop gets contracted with the color tensor which is given in ( [ f40ansatzsum ] ) in bird track notation .
for example , if the first two gluons are merged , this tensor is @xmath148 . in order to treat the tensors of this type we use the identity @xmath149 applying it to all the color contractions and using the cyclic invariance of the @xmath136 tensors and the antisymmetry under reversal of all color indices ,
one ends up with three different tensors : @xmath150 , @xmath151 , and @xmath152 .
if one now collects all diagrams that come with these respective color tensors , some contributions cancel ( because the interchange of quark and antiquark line induces a sign change ) , others get a factor of 2 .
the diagrams coming with the color tensor @xmath152 cancel completely .
we are then exactly left with the expression in ( [ f40 ] ) , which confirms that our ansatz ( [ f40ansatz ] ) was indeed correct .    in section [ sec : solution ] we will promote the ansatz of ( [ f40ansatz ] ) to an ansatz for the full four - gluon amplitude @xmath33 . however , for the future project of solving the integral equations in the @xmath7-odd channel with more than four gluons a different representation for the impact factor might also be useful .
we therefore also want to give that form which does not make use of the explicit color tensor @xmath153 of the three - gluon impact factor .
this is helpful because the quark loops for higher gluon numbers can be easily written in terms of the momentum part of the three gluon expression .    in order to obtain that representation
we go back one step and write down the expression for the four - gluon quark loop in terms of only the momentum part @xmath26 of the three - gluon amplitudes : @xmath154\\   + & f^{a_3 a_1 a_2 a_4 } [ f_{(3;0)}(12)-f_{(3;0)}(13)+f_{(3;0)}(24 ) -f_{(3;0)}(34 ) ] \ } \ , .   \end{split}\ ] ] here we can identify the momentum parts corresponding to the two color tensors : @xmath155   \,,\\
f_{(4;0)}^{(2 ) } & = \frac{ig}{2}[f_{(3;0)}(12)-f_{(3;0)}(13)+f_{(3;0)}(24 ) -f_{(3;0)}(34 ) ] \ , . \label{f402}\end{aligned}\ ] ] by directly looking at ( [ f40 ] )
an even simpler representation of @xmath156 can be found : @xmath157 and the four - gluon quark loop is expressed as @xmath158 \ } \ , .
\end{split}\ ] ]    in summary , we have derived two different ( but equivalent ) representations of the four - gluon quark loop in terms of the three - gluon quark loop : in the first representation ( [ f40ansatzexplicit ] ) the three - gluon quark loop with its color structure is used , and that will be very convenient for the construction of the four - gluon odderon amplitude in section [ sec : solution ] . the second representation ( [ f40fromf30 ] ) uses only the momentum part of the three - gluon expression and is useful for the investigation of the odderon integral equations for more than four gluons .
we now consider the general case of a quark loop with @xmath9 attached gluons , @xmath10 .
it consists of @xmath159 different diagrams . as could already be seen in the examples of three and four gluons in equations ( [ f30 ] ) and ( [ f40 ] )
, four diagrams always lead to the same color structure , because switching the first or last gluon from the quark to the antiquark or vice versa clearly does not affect the color trace .
we then get @xmath160 different color traces for the @xmath9-gluon quark loop .
these diagrams differ in the relative attachment ( to the quark or the antiquark ) of the ` inner ' @xmath161 gluons . in the previous sections we also grouped these @xmath160 different diagrams in pairs because the contributions of two diagrams in which quark and antiquark are interchanged differ only by a relative sign . for the purpose of the present section
it will be more convenient to collect these pairs at the end .    in detail
the combinatorics of the inner gluons is as follows . if all inner gluons couple to the quark line , one has the color trace @xmath162 .
then there are @xmath161 different diagrams in which one inner gluon couples to the antiquark , whereas all others couple to the quark , and so on .
for @xmath117 inner gluons attached to the antiquark and @xmath163 attached to the quark line , we get @xmath164 different color traces . to obtain the correct color trace
one simply has to write ( in descending order of the gluon indices ) the color matrices that correspond to the ` quark ' gluons in front of the matrices of the ` antiquark ' gluons ( in ascending order ) . summing all these contributions we get the complete set of contributions .
now we have to take into account the pairing of diagrams with interchanged quark and antiquark lines .
for example , the diagram in which only the first of the inner gluons couples to the antiquark line gives ( apart from the relative sign and the reversed order of the color generators ) the same result as the diagram in which all but the first inner gluon couple to the antiquark .
we thus get @xmath165 color tensors of the type @xmath135 or @xmath136 together with four momentum diagrams each .
we choose the convention to write down those diagrams of each pair where the first inner gluon is attached to the quark line , as we did also in the case of the diagrams of @xmath166 , see ( [ f40 ] ) .    these momentum diagrams can now easily be expressed in terms of the two parts @xmath156 and @xmath166 of the four - gluon amplitude , see ( [ f401 ] ) and ( [ f402 ] ) . if all inner gluons are attached to the same line , the resulting expression reads @xmath167 where we have used ( [ f401simpler ] ) to express it in terms of @xmath26 .
we have also reversed the order of the color indices so that the gluons that are attached to the quark line are written in ascending order .
this introduces a minus sign for all @xmath136 tensors .    if at least one of the inner gluons couples to the antiquark , the structure naturally is more complicated .
we will explain the construction of the general form , but also give the example of five gluons along the way .
first one has to identify all @xmath168 additional combinations of how the inner gluons can couple to the quark or antiquark lines . for five gluons
these are @xmath169 we only show the coupling of the _ inner _ gluons here , because the first and the last gluon do not affect the color structure as was explained above .
symbolically , we therefore draw the outer gluons as dashed lines and do not specify to which line they couple .
let @xmath170 now be the indices of the inner gluons that are attached to the antiquark line and @xmath171 the indices of the inner gluons attached to the quark line . as explained
before , the merging of two gluons at the antiquark line introduces an additional minus sign .
now we can write down the complete expression for one particular color structure , @xmath172 in order to avoid confusion here we have reinstated all four arguments of the amplitude @xmath166 , and again the collection of indices in one argument stands for the sum of the respective gluons momenta . adding all contributions , one arrives at the expression for the general @xmath9-gluon quark loop in terms of three- and four - gluon quark loop amplitudes .    as an example of this construction ,
the explicit form for the full impact factor for five gluons is @xmath173    finally , one can use ( [ f402 ] ) to express all the parts in terms of the three - gluon amplitude @xmath26 only . as we have chosen the diagrams in such a way that the second gluon is attached to the quark line
, the sum of quark line gluons enters the amplitude @xmath174 as the second argument and the sum of antiquark line gluons enters as the third argument .
we thus arrive at the expression for the different color parts of the @xmath9-gluon quark loop in terms of the three - gluon quark loop @xmath26 . for
it reads : @xmath175 \ , .
\end{split}\ ] ] for odd @xmath9 , once again the @xmath136 color tensor has to be replaced by a @xmath135 tensor and the factor @xmath176 has to be dropped . to get the full impact factor , all @xmath165 contributions have to be added .
again , we want to give the final expression for the five - gluon case to illustrate our results : @xmath177 \\    - \frac{g^2}{2 } & d^{a_3 a_1 a_2 a_4 a_5 }     [ f_{(3;0)}(124,3,5)- f_{(3;0)}(13,24,5)+f_{(3;0)}(1,245,3)\\ & \hspace*{1.8 cm } -f_{(3;0)}(1,24,35 ) ] \\    - \frac{g^2}{2 } & d^{a_4 a_1 a_2 a_3 a_5 }     [ f_{(3;0)}(123,4,5)- f_{(3;0)}(14,23,5)+f_{(3;0)}(1,235,4)\\ & \hspace*{1.8 cm } -f_{(3;0)}(1,23,45 ) ] \ ,
. \\ \end{split}\ ] ]    in summary , we have computed the @xmath0 impact factor for an arbitrary number of gluons .
we have shown how it can be expressed in terms of the three - gluon impact factor . for each @xmath9
the impact factor is a superposition of terms in which in the momentum part a subset of the gluons behaves like a single gluon in the three - gluon impact factor , that is only the sum of their momenta enters .    in appendix [ app : pomloop ]
we discuss how the construction of the @xmath9-gluon quark loop can be performed for the @xmath141 impact factor , that is in the @xmath7-even sector , in a completely analogous way .
in @xcite it was observed that the three - gluon amplitude @xmath178 in the eglla is a superposition of two gluon amplitudes @xmath179 , @xmath180 \,.\ ] ] this result required that the impact factor @xmath181 describing the @xmath182 transition with three @xmath6-channel gluons could be expressed in terms of the two - gluon impact factor @xmath183 , see ( [ d30 ] ) .
a similar observation was made in a part of the five - gluon state in the @xmath7-even sector , namely in the part containing the two - to - four gluon transition vertex , see @xcite . in both cases
the solution is given as a superposition of lower amplitudes in each of which a pair of gluons combines into a single gluon . in @xcite
this reggeization of the gluon was discussed also for more than two gluons which combine into one .
a remarkable property of of the eglla in the @xmath7-even sector is that reggeization leads to exact solutions of the integral equations for all odd numbers of gluons .
that means that the amplitudes @xmath184 can then be expressed in terms of the amplitudes @xmath185 .
this was found explicitly for up to six gluons and argued to hold also for general @xmath29 in @xcite .
motivated by these observations in the @xmath7-even channel we now construct a four - gluon amplitude for the @xmath7-odd channel in the same spirit .
more precisely , we will show that the following ansatz solves the integral equation ( [ inteqf4 ] ) for the full four - gluon state @xmath33 : @xmath186\,.\ ] ] these @xmath13-diagrams will be called ` splitting pairs ' from now on .
the amplitudes @xmath13 again have three arguments , one of which is the sum of the two merged gluons .
again , a contraction of the color tensor of the amplitude @xmath187 with the structure constant @xmath136 is implied .
writing out the ansatz explicitly , we have @xmath188 \ , .
\end{split}\ ] ] note that in this ansatz the full amplitude @xmath33 is expressed in terms of @xmath13 in exactly the same way as in our result ( [ f40ansatz ] ) the four - gluon impact factor @xmath174 was given in terms of the three - gluon impact factor @xmath26 .
the above ansatz already leads to a very simple cancellation in the four - gluon odderon equation ( [ inteqf4diag ] ) .
one expresses all amplitudes @xmath33 and the quark loop @xmath174 in terms of three - gluon diagrams .
then one can use the bkp equation ( [ inteqf3 ] ) to evaluate the term @xmath189 and obtains exactly the same expression for the quark loop as on the right hand side of the equation .
thus , one is left with an equation in which only the full three - gluon amplitude @xmath13 appears .
we now consider one particular splitting pair of gluons .
when using the bkp equation to cancel the @xmath16-term and the quark loop , one gets additional terms involving the three - gluon amplitude @xmath13 in which the corrections due to the kernel or the @xmath18 function occur before the splitting of one gluon into two .
there are three virtual ( @xmath18 ) corrections of this kind : two where the @xmath18-term acts on a gluon that does not split and one where it acts on the gluon that further down splits into two gluons . in the four - gluon equation
there are four virtual corrections .
two of these act on gluons coming directly from the amplitude @xmath33 , i.e.  that have not emerged from a splitting .
these cancel the corresponding two terms coming from the three - gluon equation .
the other two virtual corrections involve the two gluons that have emerged from the gluon splitting .
one then easily finds that these terms together with the upper correction of the splitting gluon exactly cancel the contribution of the @xmath48 kernel acting on the two gluons that have emerged from the splitting .
this means that all the virtual corrections and the term in which the splitting and the kernel take place in the same two gluons have canceled .
we have considered only one particular pair of splitting gluons but the cancellation immediately extends to the sum of all splittings .
now one is left exactly with all the terms involving the @xmath97 kernel and the remaining @xmath190 terms .    at this stage
one can collect all the diagrams in which one particular gluon , say the @xmath137th outgoing gluon , passes the kernel and the splitting without being affected .
then one is left with four groups of identical expressions that cancel separately due to an identity that was already discussed in the context of reggeization in the pomeron in @xcite , and in a somewhat different exposition also in @xcite .
we show this identity in pictorial language and omit the unaffected gluon : @xmath191 the arrows on top of the diagrams symbolize the symmetry of the amplitude under simultaneous exchange of momentum and color labels . in our case the interactions mediated by the integral kernel
get contracted with the three gluon odderon amplitude which also exhibits this symmetry as we have explained earlier .
that symmetry is the only property of the amplitude that is needed for the proof of this identity .
that completes our proof that the ansatz ( [ f4ansatz ] ) for @xmath33 in fact solves the full integral equation ( [ inteqf4 ] ) for the four - gluon odderon state in the eglla .
our result establishes that gluon reggeization takes place in the @xmath7-odd channel in the same way as in the @xmath7-even channel . at the same time
, it shows that one can not couple an actual four - gluon state to the @xmath0 impact factor in eglla . instead , the impact factor couples only to a superposition of three - gluon odderon states .
an important property of our solution for @xmath33 is that it satisfies the same ward - type identities which were found for the @xmath9-gluon amplitudes in the @xmath7-even sector in @xcite .
these identities follow directly from ( [ f4ansatz ] ) and from the fact that @xmath13 vanishes if one of the three gluons carries zero transverse momentum .
more precisely , we find that @xmath33 vanishes if the first or last gluon momentum is zero , @xmath192 whereas for the case that the inner gluon s momenta vanish the amplitude reduces to the lower amplitude @xmath13 .
the crucial point here is the specific behavior of the color tensors in this reduction . for the case
@xmath193 we find @xmath194 or alternatively @xmath195 to obtain the last two identities we have made use of the overall color neutrality of the four gluons .
similarly , we find for the case @xmath196 @xmath197 which also equals @xmath198 these are exactly the same identities that also hold for the reggeizing part of the four - gluon amplitude @xmath199 in the @xmath7-even channel , that is for the part which does not contain the two - to - four gluon vertex .
for a detailed discussion of the ward - type identities and of their significance for finding an effective field theory of interacting reggeized gluons we refer the reader to @xcite .
note that up to now we have obtained our results only for the blv odderon solution @xcite .
this is because we have considered the integral equations of the eglla for the case of the @xmath0 impact factor , and the blv solution is the only known odderon solution which couples to that impact factor in leading order . in the next section
we will show that an analogous solution for the four - gluon amplitude exists also for the janik - wosiek ( jw ) odderon solution @xcite .
the blv solution that we have discussed so far is not the only possible solution of the bkp equation for the @xmath7-odd three - gluon state .
the other class of solutions has the characteristic property that it vanishes if two of the transverse gluon coordinates coincide .
that class comprises the janik - wosiek odderon solution @xcite , and we will refer to that class generically as the jw odderon . in order to study that class of solutions in the eglla we have to make a different choice for the inhomogeneous term of the integral equations that we have discussed in section [ sec : eveq ] . in order to couple the jw odderon to an impact factor in
leading order we should consider an impact factor in which the three gluons are coupled to three different partons , i.e.  we need three different points in transverse space to couple the gluons to .
a suitable choice is a baryonic impact factor .
the use of perturbation theory is in general questionable for light baryons . for the purpose of the present paper ,
however , we can think of a heavy baryon or of a large momentum transfer @xmath200 in the case of a light baryon .
note that the integral equations of section [ sec : eveq ] remain fully valid after replacing the @xmath0 impact factors @xmath201 by suitable baryonic impact factors .
in contrast to the photon and the @xmath14 meson baryons are not eigenstates of @xmath7-parity .
baryonic impact factors therefore contain both @xmath7-even and @xmath7-odd contributions .
a full discussion of the baryonic impact factor with arbitrary numbers of gluons is beyond the scope of the present paper .
instead , we will restrict ourselves to the impact factor relevant for the jw solution and for up to four gluons .
we hence consider only diagrams in which at least one gluon is attached to each of the three quarks in the baryon , since all other diagrams would vanish when folded with the jw solution .
the diagrams we have to consider for three gluons are hence of the type ( to be specific here we choose a @xmath202 impact factor ) @xmath203{proton3 } }    \picraiseano=-0.5\ht0     \advance\picraiseano by 0.5\dp0    \advance\picraiseano by -6pt     \hbox{\raise\picraiseano \box0 } } \,.\ ] ] incidentally , this diagram contributes only to the @xmath7-odd channel .
this is most easily seen from its color factor , @xmath204 which contains only the symmetric color configuration of the three gluons .
the full relevant impact factor @xmath205 is obtained by adding all diagrams of this type .
( for a baryon with three different constituent quark flavors we have six diagrams , otherwise it can be less with suitable symmetry factors for equal quark flavors . ) after this summation the impact factor is symmetric in the color labels and in the momenta of the three gluons separately . since our diagrams contribute only to the @xmath7-odd channel it is clear that the corresponding diagrams for the @xmath206 impact factor have the opposite sign , but are otherwise identical .
this is again due to the sign change of the vertices when replacing all quarks by antiquarks .
therefore the @xmath7-odd impact factor for the jw odderon solution is identical to the @xmath207 impact factor in this case , @xmath208 = b^{p \to p\ , jw}_{(3;0 ) } \,.\ ] ]    as in the case of the @xmath0 impact factor , we will not need the specific dependence of the diagram @xmath209 in ( [ diagproton3 ] ) on the gluon momenta , for phenomenological models we refer the reader to @xcite and @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . instead
, we will again make use of the reduction mechanism explained in section [ sec : mechanism ] and express the relevant diagrams with four gluons in terms of three - gluon diagrams of the type ( [ diagproton3 ] ) .
note that the same cuts are applied to the amplitudes as before such that the quarks between the gluons are set on - shell
. therefore all conditions for the reduction mechanism are fulfilled and we can apply it to each pair of gluons coupled to the same quark line .
let us now consider the baryonic impact factor with four gluons .
given the two classes of odderon solutions with three gluons it is natural to expect that there will also be two distinct classes of solutions in the case of four gluons .
here we concentrate only on the jw type solution , and in analogy to the three - gluon case we consider only diagrams contributing to the impact factor in which each quark has at least one gluon coupled to it . in the case of four gluons
the resulting diagrams still contain both @xmath7-even and @xmath7-odd contributions .
we therefore need to make a projection onto the @xmath7-odd amplitude by taking one half of the difference between the baryonic impact factor and its anti - baryonic analog .
obviously , in all possible diagrams there is exactly one quark to which two gluons are attached .
we hence have a sum over all six possible pairs of gluons .
as an example we consider the first two gluons being coupled to the same quark .
a typical diagram is @xmath210{proton4_1 } }    \picraiseano=-0.5\ht0     \advance\picraiseano by 0.5\dp0    \advance\picraiseano by -6pt     \hbox{\raise\picraiseano \box0 } } \,,\ ] ] and we have to sum over all possible permutations of the quark lines exactly as in the three - gluon impact factor . the color part of that diagram is @xmath211 since the three quarks are in an antisymmetric color state in the baryon .    in the case of the impact factor with an anti - baryon ,
the possible diagrams are obtained in the same way .
the diagram corresponding to the one above is @xmath212{proton4_2 } }    \picraiseano=-0.5\ht0     \advance\picraiseano by 0.5\dp0    \advance\picraiseano by -6pt     \hbox{\raise\picraiseano \box0 } } \,.\ ] ] for later convenience we have already relabeled the summation indices for the colors in the incoming and outgoing baryon .
the color factor for this diagram is @xmath213    the momentum parts of both diagrams are identical , in particular there is no sign change ( in contrast to the three - gluon diagram , see above ) because we have an even number of gluons here .
we can now apply the reduction formula ( [ diagreduction ] ) and find that the momentum part of both diagrams is @xmath214 times the momentum part of the three - gluon diagram @xmath209 of ( [ diagproton3 ] ) with the three momentum arguments @xmath215 , @xmath216 , and @xmath217 .
the difference of the color factors of the two diagrams , on the other hand , is @xmath218 where we have expressed that difference in terms of the color factor ( [ colordiagproton3 ] ) of the three - gluon diagram @xmath209 .    hence the total contribution of our two diagrams to the @xmath7-odd channel is @xmath219 =   \nonumber \\ & & \hspace*{1 cm } = \frac{1}{2 }
\ , g f_{a_1 a_2 k } e^{k a_3 a_4}({\mathbf}k_1 + { \mathbf}k_2 , { \mathbf}k_3 , { \mathbf}k_4 )   \,.\end{aligned}\ ] ] the same mechanism obviously holds for the other permutations of the quark ( respectively antiquark ) lines , and the last formula then naturally extends to the sum of those diagrams .
it remains to sum over all pairs of gluons , and for each pair of gluons we obtain an analogous expression .
denoting the full impact factor obtained in this way by @xmath220 we can write it in terms of the corresponding three - gluon impact factor @xmath221 as @xmath222 \star \left(b^{{\cal o}\,jw}_{(3;0)}\right)^{b_1 b_2 b_3 } ( i j ) \,,\ ] ] where we have again used the notation introduced in section [ sec : loopfour ] .
we recall that the superscript @xmath223 refers to the fact that we have restricted our analysis to diagrams in which the gluons are coupled to all three quarks , that is to three distinct points in transverse space , hence giving rise to the jw odderon solution .
note that this formula is identical to the way ( [ f40ansatzsum ] ) in which the @xmath0 impact factor with four gluons was expressed in terms of the one with three gluons . clearly , reggeization takes place in the same way in both impact factors .
let us now proceed to the full three- and four - gluon amplitudes arising from the part of the baryonic impact factor relevant to the jw odderon .
the coupled integral equations for these amplitudes @xmath224 and @xmath225 are completely analogous to those for @xmath13 and @xmath33 , see ( [ inteqf3 ] ) and ( [ inteqf4 ] ) , with the @xmath0 impact factors replaced by the impact factors @xmath221 and @xmath220 discussed above . since the latter two impact factors are related to each other in exactly the same way as the three- and four - gluon @xmath0 impact factors we can immediately apply the result of section [ sec : solution ] .
hence we find a solution for the full four - gluon amplitude @xmath225 as a superposition of three - gluon amplitudes @xmath224 in exactly the way given in ( [ f4ansatz ] ) or in ( [ f4solutionexplicit ] ) .
we conclude that also in the jw class of odderon solutions an actual four - gluon state does not contribute to the amplitude
. instead , due to reggeization the four - gluon amplitude has the analytic properties induced by the corresponding three - gluon amplitude .
again , reggeization takes place in the same way as in the @xmath7-even sector .
also here the ward - type identities of @xcite are fulfilled .
two more remarks are in order concerning the baryonic impact factor and the way in which we have computed it . in the present section
we have obtained the @xmath7-odd contribution to the impact factors as the difference of the baryonic impact factor and its @xmath7-conjugate , that is by explicitly projecting onto the @xmath7-odd channel .
that method was also used ( in position space ) in @xcite where the blv odderon solution was found in the dipole picture .
implicitly , we have done something similar in the calculation of the quark loop in the @xmath0 impact factor in section [ sec : impfac ] above .
there it was the @xmath104 matrix in the loop which caused the relative signs between two diagrams related to each other by the exchange of quark and antiquark line ( corresponding to a @xmath7-parity transformation of the quark - antiquark intermediate states ) .
we found it more convenient to stay as close as possible to previous calculations of the @xmath0 impact factor with three gluons .
baryonic impact factors always contain both @xmath7-even and @xmath7-odd contributions and therefore in this case the explicit projection is needed , in contrast to the @xmath0 impact factor which couples only to @xmath7-odd states of gluons .
the calculation of the full baryonic impact factors for arbitrary numbers of gluons is clearly feasible with the methods presented here , both for @xmath7-even and for @xmath7-odd states of gluons .
the calculation of those impact factors would be important for a better understanding of reggeization of the gluon in the high energy limit .
we expect that taking into account also contributions in which not all quark lines have gluons attached one would obtain couplings to both classes of odderon solution , that is jw and blv solutions .
it should then be possible to obtain full solutions of the integral equations for four gluons as superpositions of full jw and blv solutions in analogy to the solutions found here .
that would provide further evidence for the universality of gluon reggeization at high energies .
in this paper we have made the first step in a systematic investigation of @xmath7-odd exchanges in the color glass condensate .
we have used the eglla , that is the perturbative approach based on the resummation of logarithms of the energy where we allow the number of gluons to fluctuate during the @xmath6-channel evolution .
the lowest amplitude is the well - known odderon consisting of three reggeized gluons . in the present paper
we have discussed the four - gluon amplitude .
we have computed the coupling of four gluons to the @xmath0 impact factor and to a baryonic impact factor . using these results
we have found exact solutions for the corresponding four - gluon amplitudes as superpositions of three - gluon amplitudes . in each term of that superposition a pair of gluons merges and
behaves like a single gluon in the three - gluon amplitude .
this reggeization happens in exactly the same way as in the amplitudes in the @xmath7-even sector , strengthening the evidence for the universality of this mechanism .
our result implies that there is no direct coupling of an actual four - gluon state to the relevant impact factors at the leading logarithmic level .
instead , the analytic properties of the @xmath7-odd four - gluon amplitude in the eglla are fully determined by those of the three - gluon amplitude .
it has been found that in the @xmath7-even channel the eglla is dominated by exchanges with even numbers of gluons .
more precisely , all amplitudes with odd numbers of gluons in the @xmath6-channel reggeize and become superpositions of amplitudes with even numbers of gluons .
hence the energy dependence is fully given by the spectrum of the @xmath9-gluon states with even @xmath9 .
correspondingly , the @xmath7-even amplitudes can be cast into the form of an effective field theory in which only even @xmath9-gluon states occur which couple to each other via effective transition vertices @xmath226 @xcite .
moreover , it has been observed that the @xmath9-gluon states as well as the effective transition vertices are conformally invariant in two - dimensional impact parameter space .
the obvious goal is to identify that effective conformal field theory of reggeized gluons .
note that this structure of an effective field theory emerges only if one takes into account subleading terms in @xmath8 in the @xmath9-gluon amplitudes .
the leading contributions in the expansion in @xmath227 reggeize completely when coupled to a photon - impact factor , see for example @xcite and @xcite . in order to study the interesting possibility of an effective conformal field theory of high energy qcd it is therefore crucial to go beyond the large-@xmath8 approximation .
the picture of an effective field theory of reggeized gluons in the @xmath7-even channel suggests that a similar structure should also emerge in the @xmath7-odd channel .
our results indicate that in the @xmath7-odd channel only states with odd numbers of gluons occur , and that here the amplitudes with even number of gluons like @xmath33 are superpositions of amplitudes with odd numbers of gluons . in that sense
the study of the @xmath7-odd amplitudes is complementary to the investigation of the @xmath7-even channel .
we expect that in the @xmath7-odd five - gluon amplitude a new effective three - to - five gluon vertex should appear . in the present paper
we have shown the main condition for this to be fulfilled , namely the reggeization of the gluon in the @xmath7-odd amplitudes .
recall that the transition kernels @xmath228 in the integral equations of the eglla always start from two gluons .
we therefore expect that the three - to - five transition proceeds via independent two - to - four gluon transitions in each gluon pair .
since in the three - gluon amplitude each pair of gluons is in a symmetric color octet state that would give us something like an effective two - to - four gluon vertex in the symmetric octet . this in turn would be an element of the effective theory which should play an important role also in the @xmath7-even channel , for example in the transition from the four- to the six - gluon state .
the study of the @xmath7-odd five - gluon amplitude would therefore contribute to a better understanding of the general picture of the effective field theory of the color glass condensate .
the analysis of the integral equation for the five - gluon amplitude will clearly require the knowledge of the corresponding impact factor .
in the present paper we have given an explicit formula for it in the case of the @xmath0 impact factor .
in that calculation we have found different representations which are equivalent . in the approach to the integral equations developed in @xcite , however
, the impact factor is promoted to an ansatz for the reggeizing part of the full amplitude . in that step ,
the different representations for the impact factor will in general yield different results , posing a potential problem for the further analysis of the integral equations .
the origin of the different representations was the fact that in the @xmath0 impact factor the gluons come naturally in two groups according to whether they are coupled to the quark or the antiquark , but on the other hand we need to split them into three groups for having three momentum arguments of the odderon amplitude .
this problem can be avoided by using baryonic impact factors instead .
therefore we consider it an important future project to generalize our analysis of the baryonic impact factor to arbitrary numbers of gluons .
this would give us more information on the reggeization of the gluon and might be interesting also in the @xmath7-even channel .
the knowledge of the three - to - five gluon transition in the effective field theory for the color glass condensate would be very interesting from several points of view .
it would for example allow one to compute the splitting of an odderon into an odderon plus a pomeron . from the theoretical perspective
, one could compare it with the known splitting vertex of the pomeron into two odderons and hence study the properties of the effective vertices under crossing . also from a phenomenological perspective it would be useful to compute that vertex .
clearly , it would help us in understanding the interplay of pomeron and odderon exchanges in high energy reactions .
further , it would also make it possible to compute the effect of pomeron loops on the odderon intercept , and to study saturation effects for the odderon in the large-@xmath8 limit .
we would like to thank o.  nachtmann and s.  wallon for helpful discussions .

[ app : pomloop ]    in this appendix we want to consider the @xmath182 impact factor with @xmath9 gluons attached . due to the quantum numbers of the photon
the @xmath9-gluon system is in a @xmath7-even state and hence contributes to the pomeron channel .
this particular impact factor was already considered in @xcite for up to six gluons in the context of the eglla . in @xcite
the same impact factor was studied in the simpler case of the large-@xmath8 limit .
the considerations in the present paper make it now straightforward to obtain the general form of that impact factor for arbitrary gluon numbers .
there are some differences to the @xmath0 impact factor .
firstly , the lowest pomeron state is built of only two gluons and the color tensor is @xmath229 for this state .
the corresponding two - gluon pomeron quark loop is called @xmath230 and the momentum part @xmath183 consists of only two diagrams .
( similar to the odderon case described above , there are originally four diagrams that can be reduced to two when taking into account the symmetry under quark - antiquark exchange . )
another difference concerns the color tensors .
our analysis of the @xmath0 impact factor made use of the fact that there is a @xmath104 matrix at the meson vertex and therefore a mass term must be chosen in one quark propagator to give a non - vanishing @xmath107-trace . in the pomeron case this is no longer true , as there is a @xmath231 instead of the @xmath104 matrix and all propagators therefore lend their momentum parts in order to give a non - vanishing trace ( in the limit that the quark mass is negligible compared to the typical longitudinal quark momenta ) .
this implies that now states with an odd number of attached gluons come with @xmath136 type tensors , whereas states with an even number of gluons come with @xmath135 type tensors .
the main difference becomes clear when considering the state with three @xmath6-channel gluons .
for the odderon we already found two different color tensors when we added one gluon to the minimal number of gluons , that is in the four - gluon quark loop . in pomeron case , on the contrary , the three - gluon pomeron quark loop has only one color tensor @xmath232 . in complete analogy to ( [ f40ansatz ] )
the three - gluon pomeron quark loop can be constructed by considering the three possible combinations of splitting gluons .
an @xmath136 tensor is again contracted with the color tensor of the amplitude : @xmath233 \,.\end{aligned}\ ] ] again , the arguments denote the indices of the momenta that enter as a sum in the two gluon amplitude .
as @xmath183 is symmetric under exchange of its momentum arguments , we do not need to care about the order of its arguments .
similarly to the odderon case , the above expression can be written in terms of the momentum part of the lowest impact factor only : @xmath234   \ , .
\label{d30}\ ] ] in the case of four gluons the amplitude contains two different color structures .
the corresponding momentum structures are again abbreviated as in the odderon case in ( [ f40 ] ) , @xmath235      \nonumber \\   & & \ ! - g^2 d^{a_2a_1a_3a_4 }   \ , [ d_{(2;0)}(134,2 ) + d_{(2;0)}(124,3 )                                   - d_{(2;0)}(12,34 ) \nonumber \\   & & \hspace{2.4 cm } - d_{(2;0)}(13,24 ) ] \nonumber \\ & \equiv & d^{a_1a_2a_3a_4 } d_{(4;0)}^{(1 ) }   + d^{a_2a_1a_3a_4 }   d_{(4;0)}^{(2 ) } \ , .
\label{d40}\end{aligned}\ ] ] the @xmath9-gluon quark loop for the pomeron ( @xmath236 ) is then constructed in complete analogy to the odderon quark loop in ( [ ngluoncomplete ] ) as a superposition of these terms @xmath237 and @xmath238 .
clearly , the tensor @xmath239 now appears in the odd and the @xmath135 tensors in the even gluon - number amplitudes .
these results are in complete agreement with the ones found in @xcite for up to @xmath240 .

 we formulate evolution equations for these states in which the number of gluons is not fixed during the evolution . 
 we further determine the coupling of these odderon states to the @xmath0 impact factor for arbitrary numbers of gluons . 
 we find an exact solution of the evolution equation for the four - gluon odderon state in terms of the three - gluon odderon state . 
 it is shown that a similar solution exists also for a different class of odderon solutions which does not couple to the @xmath0 impact factor .

"it is well known that , if we have a system composed by @xmath7 statistically independent subsystems ( i.e. , such that all joint probabilities factorize into the marginal ones corresponding to each subsystem ) , the boltzmann - gibbs ( bg ) entropy @xmath10 is strictly _ additive _ , i.e. , @xmath11 .
a plethora of physical systems is known for which this remarkable property still holds _ asymptotically _ ( @xmath12 ) .
such is the case , for instance , of virtually all many - body hamiltonian systems involving _ short_-range two - body interactions .
this property is called _ extensivity _ , adopting the language of thermodynamics , where it plays an important role .
many natural and artificial systems exist however that do _ not _ belong to this class , such as many - body hamiltonian systems involving two - body interactions whose range of interaction is _ long _ enough ( newtonian gravitation is one famous example ) .
such systems are known to exhibit stationary ( or _ quasi - stationary _ or _ metastable _ )
states that defy the usual , bg statistical mechanical prescriptions . for handling at least some of such anomalous systems , a generalization of bg statistical mechanics , has been proposed in 1988 @xcite , which is usually referred to as _ nonextensive _ statistical mechanics ( see @xcite for reviews ) .
it is based on the entropy @xmath13 , which generalizes the bg one .
it has been shown recently that special collective correlations can be mathematically constructed such that the entropy which is strictly _ additive _ is now @xmath2 for an adequate value of @xmath3 ( directly determined by the type of correlations ) , whereas @xmath14 is _
nonadditive_. it is easy to imagine that , in the same way that important classes of systems exist for which the strict additivity of @xmath14 is replaced by just asymptotic additivity ( i.e. , extensivity ) , a variety of classes must exist for which the strict additivity of @xmath4 is similarly replaced by asymptotic additivity ( i.e. , extensivity ) .
such systems would be the object of the so - called nonextensive statistical mechanics .
then , as a kind of bizarre linguistic twist , it turns out that the appropriate entropy @xmath2 for such , so - called _ nonextensive _ systems , is in fact expected to be _
extensive_. the generic scenario is therefore as follows : all probabilistically well defined systems are expected to have an entropy which is extensive ; those whose appropriate entropy is @xmath14 ( or its associated forms , such as those adapted to fermions and bosons ) are called _ extensive _ , and those whose appropriate entropy is @xmath8 ( or even some other entropic form ) are called _ nonextensive_.    a quantity @xmath15 associated with a system @xmath16 is said _ additive _ ( see @xcite , which we closely follow here ) with regard to a specific composition of @xmath16 and @xmath17 if it satisfies @xmath18 where @xmath19 inside the argument of @xmath20 precisely indicates that composition .    if , instead of two subsystems @xmath16 and @xmath17 , we have @xmath7 of them ( @xmath21 ) , then we have that @xmath22 if the subsystems ( e.g. , just the elements of the full system ) happen to be all equal ( a quite common case ) , then we have that @xmath23 with the notations @xmath24 and @xmath25 .
an intimately related concept is that of _ extensivity_. it appears frequently in thermodynamics and elsewhere , and corresponds to a weaker demand , namely that of @xmath26 clearly , all quantities that are additive with regard to a given composition law , also are extensive with regard to that same composition ( and @xmath27 ) , whereas the opposite is not necessarily true .
let us apply these remarks to entropy .
boltzmann - gibbs ( @xmath28 ) statistical mechanics is based on the entropy @xmath29 with @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the probability associated with the @xmath32 microscopic state of the system , and @xmath33 is boltzmann constant . in the particular case of equiprobability ,
i.e. , @xmath34 @xmath35 , eq .
( 5 ) yields the well known _
boltzmann principle _ : @xmath36 from now on , and without loss of generality , we shall take @xmath33 equal to unity .
nonextensive statistical mechanics is based on the so - called  nonextensive ' entropy @xmath2 defined as follows : @xmath37 ( later on we come back onto the denomination  nonextensive ' ) .    for equiprobability ( i.e. , @xmath38 ) , eq .
( 8) yields @xmath39 with the _ @xmath40-logarithm _ function defined as @xmath41 the inverse function ,
@xmath40-exponential _ , is given by @xmath42^{1/(1-q ) } \;\;\;(e_1^z = e^z)\ ] ] if the argument @xmath43 is positive , and vanishes otherwise .
following a common usage , we shall from now on cease distinguishing between _ additive _ and _ extensive _ , and use exclusively the word _ extensive _ in the sense of either strictly or only asymptotically additive .
consider a system composed by @xmath7 subsystems @xmath44 having respectively @xmath45 possible microstates ( we only address here the basic case of _ discrete _ microstates ) .
the total number of possible microstates for the system @xmath46 is then _ in principle _ @xmath47 .
we emphasized the expression  in principle ' because we shall see that a more or less severe reduction of the full phase space might occur in the presence of a special type of strong correlations between the subsystems .
we shall use the notation @xmath48 for the _ joint probabilities _
, hence @xmath49 the @xmath50_marginal probabilities _ are defined as follows : @xmath51 hence @xmath52 analogously are defined all the other @xmath53 _ one - subsystem_@xmath54_marginal probabilities_. the @xmath55_marginal probabilities _ are defined as follows : @xmath56 hence @xmath57 similarly are defined all the other @xmath58 - 1 $ ] _ two - subsystem_@xmath54_marginal probabilities _ , as well as all the other _ many - subsystem_@xmath54_marginal probabilities_. the most general @xmath59 case is indicated in table i.    .joint probabilities for two subsystems [ cols='^,^,^,^,^,^ ' , ]     [ tab : jpsc3bss ]     . _

the so called  nonextensive ' entropy @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) is in fact _ nonextensive _ ( _ nonadditive _ strictly speaking ) if we are composing subsystems @xmath16 and @xmath17 assumed ( sometimes _ explicitly _ , but most of the times _ tacitly _ ) to be independent .
indeed , in such case we have @xmath85 , which , unless @xmath78 , generically differs from @xmath86 .
it is from this property that currently used expressions such as _ nonextensive entropy _ and _ nonextensive statistical mechanics _ stand .
however , special types of collective correlations do exist for which extensivity is recovered for the appropriate value of @xmath40 .
this is to say , correlations such that @xmath87 .
this situation has been illustrated for @xmath59 and @xmath88 equal binary subsystems in figs .
3 and 6 respectively .
the @xmath77 case has also been illustrated ( see @xcite ) for an arbitrary number @xmath7 of arbitrary subsystems ( with number of states @xmath89 respectively ) .
the a priori total number of states is @xmath90 , but most of them have zero probability . in other words , the number of effective states ( i.e. , those whose probability is generically nonzero ) is only @xmath91 .
consequently , a necessary condition for this very special type of correlation to occur is the system to have @xmath92 zeros in its table of joint probabilities .
if the subsystems are all equal , we have @xmath93 , whereas @xmath94 . at the thermodynamic limit , it clearly is @xmath95 , i.e. , @xmath96=0 $ ] . if our subsystems were such that @xmath97 yielding a _ continuum _ , they would ultimately lead to a _
finite _ lebesgue measure .
this measure would be the hypervolume @xmath98 associated with @xmath99 dimensions , i.e. , essentially @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the lebesgue measure associated with the @xmath102dimensional @xmath103th subsystem . in remarkable contrast , @xmath6 would correspond to a set of _ zero _ lebesgue measure , such as , for instance , a ( multi)fractal whose hausdorff dimension @xmath104 would be _ smaller _ than @xmath99 .
within such a scenario , it is natural to conjecture the following situation for @xmath40 decreasing from say 1 to 0 ( see also @xcite ) .
when the subsystems are strictly independent ( no correlations at all ) or nearly independent ( typically _ short _ range two - body interactions within a many - body hamiltonian system ) , we expect an _ exponential _
@xmath7-dependence @xmath105 , and the extensive entropy to be the bg one .
in contrast , if the subsystems have special collective correlations ( typically _ long _ range two - body interactions within a many - body hamiltonian system ) , we expect a _ power - law _ behavior @xmath106 , and the extensive entropy to be @xmath2 with @xmath107 .
consistently , if @xmath108 , then the extensive entropy is @xmath109 .
for all @xmath110 we expect , in the continuum case , a zero lebesgue measure , and a fractal dimension @xmath104 decreasing with decreasing @xmath40 .
a pictorial image can help understanding the _
conjecture_. travelling in a brownian way  say an hypothetical  blind ' cowboy on the back of an hypothetical  blind ' horse  will lead to a virtually homogeneous visit of a big ( relatively plane ) territory , associated with a _
finite _ lebesgue measure . and the result would roughly be the same independently of the initial condition ( starting point of the travel )
. this would be the typical dynamics associated with _
strong _ chaos ( i.e. , _ positive _ lyapunov exponents ) , thus leading to the @xmath78 entropy . travelling in the way of a pilot of an airline company
is quite different .
first of all , he(she ) will only visit the set of airports through which this company operates .
given the small size of the airports ( compared to the size of a wide territory ) , this set constitutes a set of virtually _ zero _ lebesgue measure .
although statistically similar in geometrical terms , the result does depend on the initial conditions ( the most important hub of the network of japan airlines is tokyo , whereas the most important of varig is sao paulo , and the most important one of continental airlines is houston ) .
although no rigorous proof whatsoever is yet available , the typical dynamics to be associated is _ expected _ to be that of _ weak _ chaos ( i.e. , basically _ zero _ lyapunov exponents ) .
we expect the adequate entropy to be @xmath3 . if we wish to recover homogeneity in the visits , we need to average over virtually all the possible initial conditions .
such an average is not needed for the @xmath78 case .
occupancy of a phase space without strong restrictions makes equal probabilities of the joint system compatible with equal probabilities of each subsystem .
this compatibility disappears if visiting of some regions of the joint space is strongly enhanced whereas visiting of others is strongly inhibited ( see figs . 4 and 7 ) .
this is clearly seen for the generic @xmath77 case for any value of @xmath7 .
it might be necessary to go to the asymptotic @xmath111 limit in order to see it for say @xmath112 . in any case , the dynamics conjectured for the @xmath3 cases seem to be compatible with a recent connection @xcite in terms of recurrent visits in phase space ( the @xmath78 limit corresponding to a poisson distribution of times between consecutive visits , during the time evolution of the whole system , of a given cell of phase space ) .
let us elaborate some more on the important connection of @xmath40 with geometry .
we consider , for simplicity , the case of @xmath7 equal subsytems @xmath44 , each of them having @xmath113 possible microstates .
the total space has then @xmath93 possible microstates that can be represented on a discrete @xmath7-dimensional hypercube of linear size @xmath113 .
we shall focus however on the effective number @xmath114 of microstates whose probability generically is _ not _ zero .
a most trivial occupation is when only the  origin ' corner of the hypercube is occupied , i.e. , @xmath115 .
we then have @xmath116 .
a simple nontrivial case is when , in addition to that  corner ' , the @xmath7  edges ' of the hypercube starting from the  corner ' are occupied as well ( with generic probabilities ) .
we then have @xmath117 , hence @xmath108 and @xmath77 , as already addressed .
a next case in this series is occupancy of all the @xmath118  faces ' starting at that  corner ' .
we then have @xmath119(w_1 - 1)^2 $ ] , hence @xmath120 and @xmath121 . the next case in this series
is occupancy of all the @xmath122  cubes ' starting at that  corner ' .
we then have @xmath119(w_1 - 1)^2+[n(n-1)(n-2)/6](w_1 - 1)^3 $ ] , hence @xmath123 and @xmath124 .
in general , if all the @xmath125-dimensional hypercubes starting at that  corner ' are occupied , we have @xmath119(w_1 - 1)^2+[n(n-1)(n-2)/6](w_1 - 1)^3+ ... +[n!/(n - r)!r!](w_1 - 1)^r$ ] , hence @xmath126 and @xmath127 .
the last element of this series corresponds to fully occupy the unique @xmath7-dimensional hypercube .
we then have @xmath119(w_1 - 1)^2+ ... +[n!/(n - r)!r!](w_1 - 1)^r+ ...
+n(w_1 - 1)^{n-1}+(w_1 - 1)^n=[1+(w_1 - 1)]^n = w_1^n$ ] , hence @xmath78 .
a different geometry which nevertheless belongs to the @xmath121 universality class is the following : if , in addition to the  corner ' , all the diagonals of the @xmath118  faces ' starting at that  corner ' also are occupied , we have @xmath128(w_1 - 1)$ ] , hence @xmath120 and @xmath121 .
another different geometry could be the following one : assume that , in addition to the  corner ' , the  edges that are ( strictly or substantially ) occupied are not all @xmath7 edges , but only those following the cantor set sequence @xmath129 , whose fractal dimension is @xmath130 . we then have @xmath131 ( we are assuming that @xmath7 is a power of @xmath132 ) , hence @xmath133 and @xmath134 .
a similar situation can occur for the @xmath113 states .
suppose that , in addition to the  corner ' , all the @xmath7  edges ' are occupied but _ not _ fully occupied .
suppose that the @xmath135 states are fractally occupied ( again the cantor , or any other sequence ) with fractal dimension @xmath136 .
we then have @xmath137 , hence @xmath108 and @xmath77 .
a quite general situation could be , in the @xmath138 limit , @xmath139 .
in all these illustrations , the probabilities associated with the @xmath6 occupied microstates have no particular reason for being _ equally _ probable .
they could very well constitute a network ( e.g. , a scale - free network ) whose occupancy probabilities would characterize main hubs , and secondary hubs , and so on ( quite like the previously mentioned set of airports used by a given airlines company ) .
in fact , it would not be really surprising if classical long - range - interacting many - body hamiltonian systems would visit cells in phase space according to probabilities of this type .
this is the typical scenario we expect for the family of entropies @xmath2 .
it is easy to imagine that there can easily be even more subtle situations for which the apropriate ( extensive ) entropy would be _ not _ included in the @xmath2 family for _ any _ value of @xmath40 .
different entropic forms would perhaps be then needed .
but even within the @xmath2 family , various aspects remain to be solved , that have been only preliminarly addressed here .
let us mention two of them .
first , the solutions that we have exhibited here are probably not unique ( see the captions of figs . 3 and 6 ) .
other branches of solutions could well exist .
we have been unable , at the present stage , to find them all .
the reader surely realizes the nontrivial mathematical difficulty of _ simultaneously _ satisfying the impositions of theory of probabilities ( sum of all the joint probabilities equal to unity , partial sums of the joint probabilities equal to the marginal probabilities ) and those of extensivity of @xmath2 .
the general solution seems to be @xcite intimately related with the recently introduced @xmath40-product @xcite @xmath140 , which has , among others , the following properties : ( i ) @xmath141 , ( ii ) @xmath142 ( whereas @xmath143 ; ( iii ) @xmath144 ; ( iv ) @xmath145 ; ( v ) @xmath146 .
this interesting structure probably is one of the ingredients , but there are surely others to be considered concomitantly , specifically those related to the constraints imposed by theory of probabilities .
second , to illustrate an important point let us rewrite eq .
( 22 ) as follows : @xmath147 this relation means that it has been possible to find a function @xmath148 which satisfies the impositions of theory of probabilities .
now , if we wish this solution to correspond to the extensivity of @xmath2 , we just impose @xmath149 .
if we wish instead to impose the extensivity of @xmath150 we identify @xmath151 . in this case , we have solutions corresponding to @xmath152 .
we can even impose , if we wish , the extensivity of @xmath153 , where @xmath154 is virtually any ( increasing or decreasing ) monotonic function of @xmath40 satisfying @xmath155 .
this freedom _ might _ play a relevant role when a thermodynamical ( or thermodynamical - like ) connection is seeked . indeed ,
most of the systems which seem to obey nonextensive statistical mechanics exhibit a ( quasi)stationary state whose entropic index is @xmath156 .
this point needs further analysis in order to unambiguosly establish the identification between @xmath157 and @xmath40 which is thermodynamically adequate .
it is interesting at this stage to recall a recent discussion by robledo @xcite on a nonthermodynamical system , which has nevertheless some analogy with the present situation . basically , the so called mori s _
@xmath40-transitions _ for say the usual logistic map occur at both .2445 ... and 2 - 0.2445 ... @xcite .    a few words on terminology to conclude .
we have seen that ( under specially correlated composition of subsystems ) @xmath2 can be strictly additive ( i.e. , @xmath87 ) for a variety of values of the entropic index @xmath40 .
it has nevertheless become current denomination to refer to the @xmath78 universality class as _ extensive _ or _ normal _
systems , and to the @xmath3 universality classes as _ nonextensive _ or _ anomalous _ systems .
this use has originated from the fact that , in the early times of the theory , the focus was explicitly or tacitly put onto independent subsystems .
_ for this simple composition law , and only then , @xmath14 is strictly additive ( i.e. , @xmath158 ) , whereas @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) is not ( i.e. , @xmath85)_. although slightly misleading from the entropy standpoint , the current notational distinction _ extensive _ versus _ nonextensive _ is instead perfectly natural from the energy standpoint of hamiltonian systems . indeed ,
suppose we have a @xmath159-dimensional classical system with attractive two - body interactions whose potential energy decays with ( dimensionless ) distance @xmath125 as @xmath160 .
let us further assume for simplicity that a strong repulsion exist at the @xmath161 limit ( therefore no nonintegrable singularities exist at short distances ) .
the lennard - jones gas would be @xmath162 ; newtonian gravitation would be @xmath163 ( if we take into account the fact that at very short distances , important repulsive quantum effects are expected which would avoid the mathematical problems tied to the @xmath164 singularity ) .
the total potential energy at the ground state is expected to be @xmath165/(1-\alpha
/ d)$ ] , where we have assumed for simplicity that the @xmath7 elements of the system are roughly homogeneously distributed in space , and where the dimensionless distance @xmath125 has been chosen to be unity at the short distance effective cutoff .
we immediately see that the energy is extensive if @xmath166 , whereas it is nonextensive if @xmath167 .
it is long known ( see , for instance , @xcite ) that , for the @xmath166 systems , bg statistical mechanics is perfectly adequate .
more over , for them the @xmath168 and the @xmath111 limits commute , thus always leading to thermal equilibrium . on the other hand ,
plethoric evidence now exists that , in remarkable variance , for the @xmath169 systems , the @xmath168 and the @xmath111 limits do not commute , the physically interesting states for large systems being the ( quasi)stationary or metastable ones corresponding to taking first the @xmath111 limit and only afterwards the @xmath168 limit . for such anomalous states ,
the inadequacy of bg statistical mechanics is notorious _ when we use no other dynamics than the natural one _ ( newton s law if the system is classical ) @xcite .
for instance , the distribution of velocities is seemingly _ not _ maxwellian , and there is _ aging _ , a phenomenon absolutely incompatible with the translational invariance expected for thermal equilibrium .
a transparent proof that nonextensive statistical mechanics ( with a @xmath3 entropy @xmath2 ) is in place is still lacking , but this could be the case . indeed , vanishing lyapunov exponents have been exhibited , as well as the specific anomalous diffusion associated with the nonlinear fokker - planck equation , and a variety of @xmath62exponential behaviors @xcite .
work is in progress and further contributions are welcome .

the qualification is needed .
for instance , aging can also be , and frequently is , introduced in a variety of systems ( e.g. , spin - glasses ) through dynamics which _ a priori _ use the bg factor , i.e. , dynamics in which the bg weight is put by hand ( monte carlo - like procedures , glauber dynamics , etc ) .
we do not refer to these , but instead to the ( classical , quantum , relativistic ) natural dynamics which dictate the microscopic evolution of the entire system .
_ only _ such dynamics are to be considered if the purpose is to study the foundations of statistical mechanics ." ," many natural and artificial systems whose range of interaction is long enough are known to exhibit ( quasi)stationary states that defy the standard , boltzmann - gibbs statistical mechanical prescriptions . for handling such anomalous systems ( or at least some classes of them ) , _ nonextensive _ statistical mechanics has been proposed based on the entropy @xmath0 , with @xmath1 ( boltzmann - gibbs entropy ) . 
 special collective correlations can be mathematically constructed such that the strictly _ additive _ entropy is now @xmath2 for an adequate value of @xmath3 , whereas boltzmann - gibbs entropy is _ 
 nonadditive_. since important classes of systems exist for which the strict additivity of boltzmann - gibbs entropy is replaced by asymptotic additivity ( i.e. , extensivity ) , a variety of classes are expected to exist for which the strict additivity of @xmath4 is similarly replaced by asymptotic additivity ( i.e. , extensivity ) . 
 all probabilistically well defined systems whose adequate entropy is @xmath5 are called _ extensive _ ( or _ normal _ ) . 
 they correspond to a number @xmath6 of _ effectively _ occupied states which grows _ exponentially _ with the number @xmath7 of elements ( or subsystems ) . 
 those whose adequate entropy is @xmath8 are currently called _ nonextensive _ ( or _ anomalous _ ) . 
 they correspond to @xmath6 growing like a _ power _ of @xmath7 . to illustrate this scenario , recently addressed @xcite , we provide in this paper details about systems composed by @xmath9 two - state subsystems . "
"vast majority of internet traffic relates to content access from the sources such as youtube , netflix , bit torrent , hulu , etc .
this rapid increase of content delivery in the internet has revealed the need for a different networking paradigm .
further , as fig . [ fig : fig1 ] describes , the emerging trend is that the users are just interested in the information ( content ) , and not where it is located or perhaps , even how it is delivered .
this high increase in demand for video content in the internet and the need for new approaches to control this large volume of information have motivated the development of future internet architectures based on named data objects ( ndos ) instead of named hosts @xcite .
such architectural proposals are generally referred to as information centric networking ( icn ) which is a new communication paradigm to increase the efficiency of content delivery and also content availability @xcite-@xcite . in this new concept
, the network infrastructure actively contributes to content caching and distribution and every icn node can cache and serve the requested content . to fulfill that purpose ,
several architectures have been proposed for icn to reflect current and future needs better than the existing internet architecture @xcite-@xcite . to provide preferable services to the users in icn , internet service providers
( isps ) or access icns should be able to maintain quality of service ( qos ) by improving the response time for file request .
they need to cache the frequently requested or popular content locally and store them near the users in the network .
to provide qos , in - network caching is introduced to provide the network components with caching ability
. therefore every node actively contributes in content caching and operates as a potential source of content .
this leads to reduction in network congestion and user access latency and increase in the throughput of the network by locally caching the more popular content @xcite-@xcite .
several works have claimed that web ( file ) requests in internet are distributed according to zipf s law @xcite-@xcite .
zipf s law states that the relative probability of a request for the @xmath0th most popular content is proportional to @xmath1 .
however , several other studies have found out that the request distribution generally follows generalized zipf distribution where the request rate for the @xmath0th most popular content is proportional to @xmath2 and @xmath3 is a positive value less than unity @xcite-@xcite .
since each icn requires cooperation in caching from other icns to provide a global high performance network , it is necessary to have pricing policies to incentivize all the icns to contribute to the caching process @xcite .
several works have been done to address the problem of the economics of service pricing in current internet and interconnection networks @xcite-@xcite .
using contemporary pricing policies can not incentivize the lower tier isps to cooperate in the future internet architecture @xcite ; hence , we need to have new models to provide them with monetary incentives to collaborate in caching and distributing content when content with different popularities are available in the network .    in this paper
, we investigate joint caching and pricing strategies of the access icn , the transit icn and the content provider based on content popularity .
we study nash strategies for a non - cooperative game among the above entities using a probabilistic model by assuming that access requests generally follow the generalized zipf distribution .
we then use the insights gained to simplify the problem by replacing two caching threshold indices instead of caching parameters for the symmetric case ; where all access icns have the same parameters . in our model ,
the icns caching costs vary in respect to content popularity while the content provider cost per unit data is fixed for all content types .
the rest of the paper is organized as follows .
section ii reviews some related works . in section iii , we describe the system model .
the problem formulation for joint caching and pricing strategies is described in section iv .
we examine the generalized scenario for arbitrary number of access icns in section v. the symmetric access icns scenario is analyzed in section vi .
section vii presents numerical results on the resulting caching and pricing strategies , and we conclude in section viii .
the benefits of in - network caching have been investigated before in the setting of distributed file systems in several recent works . in @xcite , the problem of caching
is studied from an information - theoretic viewpoint .
they propose a coded caching approach that in addition to the local caching gain is able to achieve a global caching gain . a novel cooperative hierarchical caching ( chc )
framework is proposed in @xcite in the context of cloud access radio networks ( c - ran ) .
content caching and delivery in device - to - device ( d2d ) networks have been studied in @xcite .
the aim of this work is to improve the performance of content distribution by the use of caching and content reuse .
several approaches such as base station assisted d2d network and other schemes based on caching at the user device are compared to show the improvement of the network throughput in the presence of in - network caching .
another recent article @xcite studies the limitation of current reactive networks and proposes a novel proactive networking paradigm where caching plays a crucial role .
it shows that peak data traffic demands can be substantially reduced by proactively serving users demands via caching .
@xcite has used a mean field game model to study distributed caching in ultra dense small cell networks .
zhang et al have proposed an optimal cache placement strategy based on content popularity in content centric networks ( ccn ) in @xcite .
the authors in @xcite have proposed a collaborative caching and forwarding design for ccn .
the problem of joint caching and pricing for data service for a single internet service provider ( isp ) is studied in @xcite .
similar problem but for multiple isps in the setting of small cell networks is investigated in @xcite using a stackelberg game .
one of the earliest studies of economic incentives in information centric networks has been conducted by rajahalme et al .
@xcite and has demonstrated that top level providers are not willing to cooperate in the caching process since they can not get enough revenue .
another recent study by agyapong et al .
@xcite has addressed the economic incentive problem in icn by building a simple economic model to evaluate the incentive of different types of network players in a hierarchical network infrastructure .
they qualitatively showed that without explicit monetary compensation from publishers , the network will fail to deploy the socially optimal number of caches .
few prior works have used game theoretic approaches to solve the problem of caching and pricing in icn . in @xcite
the authors have presented a game theoretic approach using matrix payoff to analyze the process of economic incentives sharing among the major network components .
a pricing model was proposed in @xcite to study the economic incentives for caching and sharing content in information centric networks which consists of access icns , a transit icn and a content provider .
this work has shown that if each player s caching ( pricing ) strategy remains fixed , the utility of each player becomes a concave function of its own pricing ( caching ) strategy .
therefore a unique nash equilibrium ( _ ne _ ) exists in a non - cooperative pricing ( caching ) game among different players . in our earlier work @xcite
, a similar model was adopted to address the problem of joint caching and pricing strategies in a network including two access icns , one transit icn and one content provider .
however , content popularity was not taken into account and the icns were agnostic to content type .
the interaction of the above entities is modeled using game theoretic approach .
it was shown that each player can optimize its caching and pricing strategies in a non - cooperative game . at the ne ,
the caching strategies turn out to be 0 - 1 ( all or nothing ) strategies , where each access icn caches all the requested demand if its caching cost is less than the transit icn s caching cost .
when the caching cost of the access icn is higher than the transit icn s , all the requested content will be served by either the transit icn or the content provider , whichever has the lower caching cost .
it means that the content would be cached in the icn with smallest caching cost . to the best of our knowledge ,
none of the earlier works consider the problem of joint caching and pricing in an icn in the presence of content with different popularity .
in contrast , in this paper , we study joint caching and pricing strategies with the notion of content popularity for an icn network with different elements considering asymmetric utility functions .
there are @xmath4 different types of content in the network that each user is trying to access .
each type of content has a different measure of popularity reflected by the probability of requests for it .
we consider a model where the popularity of content is uniformly similar in all parts of the network , i.e. , all users in the network have the same file popularity distribution .
analyzing the impact of different per - user file popularities is an open problem . as in previous works ( e.g. @xcite-@xcite , @xcite-@xcite , @xcite-@xcite ) , in this paper the distribution of user requests for content is described by a generalized zipf distribution function as follows :    @xmath5    where @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the exponent characterizing the zipf distribution in which @xmath8 makes the distribution uniform and all the content will be identical in popularity , whereas the case of @xmath9 corresponds to one where the content popularity distribution is following the classic zipf s law and more popular content is dominant in the network .
the content is ranked in order of their popularity where content @xmath10 is the @xmath10th most popular content , i.e. , @xmath11 is the most popular content and @xmath12 is the least popular content .    in most of the aforementioned works that have studied in - network caching , the popularity profile of content was assumed to be identical and perfectly known by all the network components . in reality , the demand and popularity are not predictable and certain @xcite , @xcite .
the problem of caching has been studied in @xcite wherein the users have access to demand history but no knowledge about popularity .
several other papers have used learning - based approaches to estimate the popularity profile at the user side @xcite-@xcite . while content learning is more accurate for modeling content popularity , the reason we have used the zipf model is due to ( 1 ) experimental results showing reasonable fit to the zipf model and ( 2 ) analytical tractability provided by the zipf model .
our framework can be extended by changing the demand model and considering a repeated game with a parametric zipf distribution . in each time slot of the game , this parameter can be estimated in an optimal way using a learning process .
although the prices are fixed for all types of content , since the icns want to earn more profit by caching the content , they are more willing to locally store the content which is more popular .
thus , the access icns and the transit icn s caches treat the content differently in regard to their popularity . as the content gets more popular ,
the icns incur less caching costs to locally store the content .
[ t1 ] for a finite cache , the caching costs of access and transit icns is defined to be inversely proportional to the content popularity as follows @xmath13 where , without loss of generality , @xmath14 is a fixed initial caching cost at icn @xmath15 .
using equations ( [ eq:1 ] ) and ( [ eq:2 ] ) , we see in fig .
[ fig : accessc2 ] , for fixed values of @xmath0 , @xmath16 is a decreasing function of @xmath3 when @xmath0 is small ( i.e. , more popular content ) . on the other hand
, @xmath16 is an increasing function of @xmath3 when @xmath0 is large ( i.e. , less popular content ) . unlike the access and transit icns , the content provider has no priority for caching the content and caches all types of content .
the content provider incurs the constant cost @xmath17 for every unit of data that it serves for the transit icn .      for simplicity in illustration , as shown in fig .
[ fig : fig2 ] , we begin with a hierarchical network model @xcite , @xcite with two access icns ( a and b ) , one transit icn ( c ) , one content provider ( o ) and an arbitrary number of users who can switch from one access icn to another .
the access icns connect the end - users to the content network and the transit icn provides wide - area transport for the access icns while the content provider provides the content for the users .
[ fig : fig2 ] also shows the monetary and data flows among different entities with the various prices described in table [ table1 ] .
the network economy depends on two effective factors : caching and pricing . under the assumption that each icn can have access to all content
, it can decide to either cache the entire or portion of the requested content , or get it from somewhere else .
the caching strategy adopted by each entity is denoted by the parameter @xmath18 that takes values in the interval @xmath19 $ ] .
every icn decides to cache different types of content independently , therefore , we have a specific caching variable for each type of content . we have denoted @xmath20 , where @xmath21 can either be access or transit icn and @xmath22 is any cache in the network ( possibly another icn or content provider ) , as the fraction of icn @xmath21 s demand for content type @xmath0 that comes from cache @xmath22 .
each icn also has different pricing strategies .
these strategies are the prices that each player charges others for the provided service .
the pricing is based on the usage , i.e. , price per unit data .
each access icn sets two different prices : ( 1 ) the network price per unit data for transporting the content ; and ( 2 ) the storage price per unit data for providing content from its cache for other icns .
for example , the network and storage prices for access icn @xmath23 are denoted as @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively .
the total price per unit data is the sum of these two prices and is denoted by @xmath26
. we will find it useful to utilize an alternative form of the above . following the charging policies of several storage services for the internet such as amazon s3
, it would be practical to assume that the storage price is typically less than the network price . the linear relationship between network price and storage price while empirical , has been used earlier in @xcite and we follow this assumption .
it can be represented by @xmath27 where @xmath28 .
thus , the relationship between @xmath29 and @xmath25 would be @xmath30 . as a result ,
each access icn or transit icn will have a set of strategies for pricing in the interval @xmath31 .
the content provider pricing strategies set also consists of the content price @xmath32 that the users should pay for content and the storage price @xmath33 which is the price for providing the content from the content provider cache .
the access icn @xmath23 and @xmath34 charge prices @xmath29 and @xmath35 to their users and @xmath25 and @xmath25 to the transit network if they store or forward the content that the transit icn had asked for .
the transit icn @xmath36 charges access icns @xmath23 and @xmath34 with price @xmath37 , if it stores or forwards their requested content .
the content provider charges users with content price @xmath32 and transit icn @xmath36 with storage price @xmath33 if it stores transit icn requested content .
.summary of notation [ cols='^,<',options='header ' , ]
we can extend the case of two access icns , one transit icn and one content provider to a generalized scenario of k access icns , one transit icn and one content provider .
we consider @xmath39 as the set of access icns which are connected to transit icn @xmath36 and @xmath40 is the set of all caching variables .
the demand function of each access icn is defined in definition [ t3 ] .
[ t3 ] the received demands at access icn @xmath41 is defined as    @xmath42 - { \rho _ 0}p_o^{(c)},\forall j=1, ... ,k   \end{array}\ ] ]    the received demand of content type @xmath0 by access icn @xmath41 can be shown as @xmath43.following the previous section , the maximization problem of each access icn @xmath44 can be defined as follows :    @xmath45    the transit icn @xmath36 maximization problem is given by the following equation :    @xmath46    and the content provider @xmath47 maximizes its utility using equation ( [ content ] ) .
@xmath48 } \left ( { p_o^{\left ( s \right ) } - { c_o } } \right ) } { \begin{array}{*{20}{c } } { } & { + \sum\limits_{k \in \tilde k } { { \sigma _ k } } p_o^{\left ( c \right ) } } \end{array}}\\ { s.t.\begin{array}{*{20}{c } } { } & { } & { p_o^{\left ( c \right ) } > 0,p_o^{\left ( s \right ) } > { c_o } } \end{array } } \end{array}\ ] ]    theorem [ t1 ] can be extended for the generalized @xmath38 access icn case with the same reasoning and all the caching variables take binary values ( i.e. , all or nothing 0 - 1 strategies ) .
so , the joint caching and pricing strategy game in the general form is also a mixed integer program . in the next section
we will simplify the problem with the assumption of symmetric access icns with similar characteristics and try to give some analytical and intuitive results .
in the previous section , the general form of the caching and pricing strategies for icns was formulated through equations ( [ access])-([content ] ) as a set of mixed integer programs . in this section , in order to analytically study the equilibrium of our proposed model , we consider the symmetric scenario , where all access icns have the same specifications . for the symmetric scenario , where all the access icns are exactly the same
, we consider @xmath49 .
[ t2 ] in the symmetric case , for each content type @xmath0 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 .    according to equations ( [ access ] ) ,
when access icn @xmath41 receives a request for content type @xmath0 and transit price is greater than its caching cost for that particular type of content ( @xmath52 ) , access icn @xmath41 decides to serve the requested content itself by adopting value 1 for caching parameter @xmath53 . since @xmath54 , then all the other caching parameters for
content type @xmath0 would be equal to zero .
on the other hand , if the transit price is less than the access icn s caching cost for content type @xmath0 ( @xmath55 ) , the access icn @xmath41 will forward the request to the transit icn @xmath36 to be served by choosing @xmath56 . when the transit icn @xmath36 receives the request , it should decide to either cache the content or forward it to the content provider or other access icns based on the payoff that it gains according to equations ( [ transit ] ) .
considering the theorem [ t1 ] and the constraint @xmath57 , one of the caching parameters should be 1 and others should be 0 . if @xmath58 or @xmath33 are the minimums among @xmath59 , the transit icn @xmath36 ( @xmath60 ) or the content provider @xmath47 ( @xmath61 ) will serve the request , respectively
. now assume that one of the access icn s storage price @xmath62 is the minimum .
if @xmath62 is the minimum , it means that @xmath63 . on the other hand , @xmath64 in order to the access icn @xmath38 accepts the request ; otherwise it does not accept the content to prevent from losing payoff .
therefore , @xmath65 .
note that @xmath66 in symmetric scenario . thus @xmath62 should adopt a value greater than access icn @xmath41 s caching cost and less than transit icn @xmath36 s caching cost for content type @xmath0 ( @xmath67 ) . on the other hand , we know that @xmath55 , therefore @xmath68 .
it means that @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 are negative and that s a contradiction since the transit icn @xmath36 is trying to choose @xmath37 in a way to get at least zero payoff .
thus @xmath62 can never be the minimum value among the others and accordingly @xmath50 , @xmath72 , in the symmetric scenario case .    to better understand the implication of theorem [ t2 ] , we can refer to table [ table2 ] that shows the caching strategies at the equilibrium for asymmetric case with two access icns which are not identical . by assuming two identical access icns that have the same characteristics , the cases
2 - 7 can be removed and the table will reduce to just three cases and in all of these cases @xmath73 .
this table can also be extended for the generalized scenario with @xmath38 access icns .
what the above theorem reveals is that in the symmetric case , access icns have no motivation to serve each other s users .
this is not against the philosophy of the content centric network paradigm , since in this setup the access icns and also the transit icn are capable of caching the requested content . besides , this theorem is just for the _ symmetric scenario _ and in the asymmetric setup the access icns are able to cache requests for users of other access icns
moreover , according to theorem [ t2 ] , when the system is symmetric , we can add the following facts to our models .
@xmath74    so using theorem [ t2 ] and ( [ eq:13 ] ) , we can reformulate our maximization problem described in ( [ access])-([content ] ) for symmetric case .
the maximization problems for access icn @xmath41 can be expressed in equation ( [ eq:14 ] ) as follows : @xmath75 the maximization problem for transit icn @xmath36 can be defined in the following equation :    @xmath76    and finally , the content provider maximization problem can be reformulated as the following @xmath77}\\ { s.t.\begin{array}{*{20}{c } } { } & { } & { p_o^{\left ( c \right ) } > 0,p_o^{\left ( s \right ) } > { c_o } } \end{array } } \end{array}.\ ] ]    as mentioned in theorem [ t1 ] , the caching parameters still take on binary values . moreover , since the content popularity probability function @xmath78 is monotonically decreasing ; according to ( [ eq:2 ] ) , the access and transit icns caching costs are monotonically increasing depending on the content type . for access
icn @xmath41 , the caching parameter @xmath53 adopts value 1 when the transit price @xmath37 is greater than the access icn caching cost @xmath79 .
hence , if @xmath53 is 1 for content type @xmath0 , it would also be 1 for content type @xmath80 .
it means that if access icn decides to cache the content type @xmath0 , it will cache all the other content that are more popular than it .
so , there would be a caching threshold index for the number of content type that access icn is willing to locally store .
we denote the optimum caching threshold index by @xmath81 for access icn @xmath41 . in the symmetric scenario , the caching threshold indices @xmath81
are identical for all access icns , so we consider @xmath82 as the caching threshold index for all the access icns . since caching content types @xmath83 to @xmath4 is not beneficial for access icns , they will forward these to the transit icn @xmath36 to be served .
the transit icn @xmath36 should decide to either serve the content itself or forward it to somewhere else . in the symmetric case , as mentioned in theorem [ t2 ] , in case it decides not to serve the content itself , it can forward it to the content provider @xmath47 . according to ( [ eq:16 ] ) , if the content provider storage price @xmath33 is greater than the transit icn @xmath36 caching cost @xmath58 , the caching parameter @xmath84 adopts value 1 and the transit icn @xmath36 caches the content type @xmath0 . on the other hand , if @xmath33 is less than @xmath58 , the caching parameter @xmath84 will be 0 and @xmath85 adopts value 1 . in this case , the content provider @xmath47 will take care of the request for content type @xmath0 . as discussed , for access icns
, the transit icn also can have a caching threshold index .
it means that if it caches content type @xmath0 , it would also be able to cache the content type @xmath80 .
so there would be a caching threshold index for the number of content type that the transit icn @xmath36 is willing to locally store .
we denote this caching threshold index by @xmath86 .
so the transit icn @xmath36 will serve the content with popularity index @xmath83 to @xmath86 and content with popularity index greater than @xmath86 will be served by the content provider @xmath47 .
we can summarize these new parameters in ( [ eq:18 ] ) and ( [ eq:19 ] ) .
@xmath87    @xmath88    thus , all the caching variables @xmath40 will be replaced by two caching threshold indices @xmath82 and @xmath86 . by ( [ eq:18 ] ) and ( [ eq:19 ] ) , the problem set of ( [ eq:14])-([eq:17 ] )
can be rearranged using new parameters @xmath82 and @xmath86 . the new maximization problem for access icn @xmath41
is given as the following :    @xmath89}\\ { s.t.\begin{array}{*{20}{c } } { } & { 0 \le th \le m , } \end{array}{p_{{a_j } } } > 0 } \end{array}\ ] ]    the transit icn @xmath36 maximizes its utility function as the following :    @xmath90    and the content provider @xmath47 maximization problem is formulated using new parameters in ( [ eq:23 ] )    @xmath91    note that in the above equations @xmath92 .
the problem of joint caching and pricing strategies for the case of symmetric icns can be decomposed into two independent caching and pricing optimization problems .
the caching problem is dealing with the parameters that affect the caching process and is stated as follows :    @xmath93 caching problem : : :    @xmath94    @xmath95    @xmath96    the outcome of this problem is a 4-tuples @xmath97 .
the pricing problem is defined in ( [ eq:27 ] ) and ( [ eq:29 ] ) by substituting the 4-tuple resulting from the caching problem .
@xmath93 pricing problem : : :    @xmath98\\ s.t.\begin{array}{*{20}{c } } { } & { { p_a}_j > 0 } \end{array } \end{array}\ ] ]    @xmath99    the k+1-tuple @xmath100 is the outcome of the pricing problem .
the nash equilibrium of the joint caching and pricing problem is @xmath101 .
[ t3 ] the caching problem introduced above is a two player matrix game between transit icn @xmath36 and content provider @xmath47 .
according to ( [ access ] ) , when the transit price for icn @xmath36 is greater than access icn s caching cost for content type @xmath0 @xmath102 , the access icn caches all the content which are more popular than content type @xmath0 .
therefore , when @xmath103 , the optimum caching threshold index chosen by access icn will be @xmath104 . on the other hand , since the utility function of the transit icn @xmath36 has a linear relationship with the transit price @xmath105 , the transit icn will choose the maximum value possible that is @xmath106 ( @xmath107 is a very small value ) .
thus , the transit icn @xmath36 also can adopt its actions from a discrete set .
there is a caching threshold index @xmath82 corresponding with each transit price chosen by icn @xmath36 .
it shows that the transit icn is the leader in its relationship with the access icns and its action is @xmath108 from a set of @xmath109 feasible choices .
the relationship between the transit icn @xmath36 and the content provider is also a leader follower game .
depending on the storage price @xmath33 , the transit icn @xmath36 might forward some part of demands to the content provider @xmath47 to be served .
if the access icn decides to cache the content more popular than content type @xmath82 , the rest of the content should be forwarded to transit icn .
therefore , the content type with index @xmath83 to @xmath4 is going to be served in either the transit icn or the content provider . when @xmath110 , the optimum caching threshold index chosen by the transit icn @xmath36 will be @xmath111 . since , the utility of the content provider @xmath47 has a linear relationship with the storage price @xmath33 ; the content provider will pick the maximum value possible for the storage price that is @xmath112 .
thus , for every content provider storage price , there is a corresponding caching threshold index chosen by the transit icn @xmath36 .
since both the transit icn @xmath36 and the content provider @xmath47 have a limited set of discrete actions , the problem introduced in ( [ eq:24])-([eq:26 ] ) is a matrix game between the transit icn @xmath36 and the content provider @xmath47 when the transit icn action is the transit price @xmath37 and content provider action is the storage price @xmath33 .
the access icns can not change the results and they just follow the transit icn and their actions .    by theorem [ t3 ] , we can discard ( [ eq:24 ] ) and solve equations ( [ eq:25 ] ) and ( [ eq:26 ] ) jointly to find the integer thresholds @xmath82 and @xmath86 . note that @xmath105 and @xmath33 are functions of @xmath82 and @xmath86 , respectively as follows :    @xmath113    @xmath114    [ p2 ] @xmath115 and @xmath116 @xmath117 are concave sequences and have a unique maximum .
the proof of the above proposition can be found in _
appendix a_.    [ t4 ] the symmetric joint caching and pricing game has a unique nash equilibrium .
the solution of the caching and pricing problems in ( [ eq:24])-([eq:29 ] ) is the nash equilibrium .
on the one hand , the caching problem set is like a leader - follower game and the transit icn @xmath36 ( leader ) maximizes ( [ eq:25 ] ) and the content provider @xmath47 ( follower ) maximizes ( [ eq:26 ] ) .
since both of them are concave sequences based on proposition [ p2 ] , they have only one maximum in their feasible sets . by ( [ eq:25 ] )
, @xmath118 can be defined as the unique optimum value for the access icn caching threshold inex and by ( [ eq:26 ] ) , @xmath119 can be defined as the optimum caching threshold index of the transit icn @xmath36 that should always be greater or equal than @xmath118 .
assume that @xmath120 is the value that maximizes ( [ eq:26 ] ) . if @xmath121 then @xmath122 and if @xmath123 then @xmath124 . by finding the first set of parameters and substituting them in ( [ eq:27 ] ) and ( [ eq:29 ] ) , we can find the second set of parameters . since these are concave quadratic functions the problem has the following unique solution @xmath125 .
\end{array}\ ] ] note that @xmath126 s are always greater than zero . hence , as we have unique set of results for @xmath118 and @xmath119 , so @xmath126 s and @xmath127 are also unique
. therefore the nash equilibrium exists and is unique .
as the analytical results show , the nash equilibrium for the symmetric case is independent of number of access icns .
so , for the numerical results section , we consider the scenario with only two access icns .
we consider the interaction among two symmetric access icns , one transit icn and a content provider who are competing to maximize their utilities . in this scenario , the reflective coefficients of price s influence on users demands @xmath128 , @xmath129 and @xmath130 are set identically to 0.1 .
these parameters model the sensitivity of the demands to an increase in the prices .
the scaling parameter between network price and storage price is set to @xmath131 , i.e. , the storage price is an order of magnitude less than the network price .
there are @xmath132 different types of content in this network which are randomly requested by users according to a generalized zipf distribution .
[ fig : accessc2 ] shows how the access icn caching cost varies for different types of content and different zipf s factor @xmath3 when initial caching cost @xmath133 . as zipf s factor
@xmath3 is increasing , the distribution of content requested is getting skewed and according to ( [ eq:2 ] ) , the caching costs of more popular content decrease while the caching costs of less popular content increase .
note that the transit icn @xmath36 possibly has ( on average ) access to cheaper caches .
we denote the ratio of transit icn caching cost to access icn caching cost by @xmath134 .
we assume that the content provider cost ( @xmath17 ) for all types of content is identical .    ,
width=377,height=302 ]     for various content provider cost @xmath17 when @xmath135 , width=377,height=302 ]     for various content provider cost @xmath17 when @xmath136 , width=377,height=302 ]     vs zipf s factor @xmath3 for various content provider cost @xmath17 and @xmath135,width=377,height=302 ]    the caching strategies @xmath118 and @xmath119 at the equilibrium are shown in fig .
[ fig : threshold7 ] , where zipf s factor @xmath3 is varying in the interval of 0.01 to 1 . in this scenario ,
the caching cost of transit icn c is set to @xmath137 of the caching cost of access icns for every type of content @xmath0 , i.e. , @xmath135 .
the results are compared for @xmath138 .
as seen , for small amount of @xmath3 the content are less skewed and the caching cost for them is very similar . since the caching cost of transit icn is less than access icns and content provider s , it decides to cache most of the content .
but as @xmath3 increases , some of the content is getting relatively more popular . in this case , the access icns prefer to cache the more popular content locally and smaller amount of content will be cached by transit icn and content provider . for the higher @xmath3 , the caching cost of access icns and transit icn is getting higher and they do not have an incentive to locally store them . therefore , at this point , the content provider starts to serve more content than before and the transit icn does nt cache content and just forwards requests to the content provider .
for higher content provider cost @xmath139 , since the cost is so high the content provider just serves the less popular requested content but as the cost @xmath17 increases , it starts to serve more content . for the case which @xmath17 is relatively small ( @xmath140 ) , the transit icn does nt have the incentive to spend its resources for caching the requested content and just forwards all the requests for content from access icns to the content provider . the same scenario with @xmath136
is examined in fig .
[ fig : threshold5 ] . in this case , the transit icn caching cost is half of the access icn caching cost for each type of content .
so , the transit icn caches more requested content in its cache .    fig .
[ fig : access ] shows the access icn price @xmath141 as function of @xmath3 for different content provider costs @xmath17 .
@xmath141 decreases as the @xmath3 gets higher when the content provider cost @xmath17 is relatively low .
the reason is that as @xmath3 increases , the caching costs of more popular content at access icns caches are getting lower .
therefore , the access icns need to decrease their price @xmath141 in order to compete with other access icns .
but as the relative content provider cost @xmath17 increases , the access price is getting higher since both the access icn and the transit icn have a greater incentive to locally cache the content .
however , the price for greater value of @xmath17 displays a bimodal behavior as a function of @xmath3 . according to fig .
[ fig : accessc2 ] , for relatively small value of @xmath3 , the different types of content have similar popularity and the access and transit icn should incur more or less similar caching costs for each type of content .
but as @xmath3 increases , some of the content is getting more popular and the cost of caching them at the access icn is decreasing .
therefore , the access icn decreases it s access price in order to induce increased demand from the users ( see relationship between @xmath141 and demand in equation ( [ eq:3 ] ) ) . on the other hand , when @xmath3 keeps increasing , the transit price and the content provider storage price increase .
thus , the access icn needs to slightly increase its price to compensate the increase in the transit price .
after the slight increase , as @xmath3 increases further , the access price @xmath141 decreases again .
this is because , as seen from fig .
4 , the caching strategies @xmath118 and @xmath119 are the same for large @xmath3 . at this point , the access icns decide to cache the content that are more popular to get higher payoff . as a result
, the access icn decreases the price to further incentivize greater user demand for popular content .
the transit price @xmath105 and the content provider storage price @xmath33 are shown in fig .
[ fig : transit ] . as @xmath3 increases , the caching costs of less popular content that are going to be cached in transit icn or content provider caches are increasing .
therefore , both the transit icn and content provider should increase their prices as shown in the figure .
for various content provider cost @xmath17 and @xmath135,width=377,height=302 ]
in this paper , we developed an analytical framework for distribution of popular content in an information centric network ( icn ) that comprises of access icns , a transit icn and a content provider . by modeling the interaction of the above entities using game theory and under the assumption that the caching cost of the access icns and transit icns is inversely proportional to popularity , which follows a generalized zipf distribution
, we first showed that at the ne , the caching strategies turn out to be 0 - 1 ( all or nothing ) .
further , for the case of symmetric access icns , we showed that a unique nash equilibrium exists and the caching policy ( 0 or 1 ) is determined by a threshold on the popularity of the content ( reflected by the zipf probability metric ) , i.e. , all content more popular than the threshold value is cached .
moreover , we showed that the resulting threshold indices and prices can be obtained by a decomposition of the joint caching and pricing problem into two independent caching only and pricing only problems .
finally , using numerical results we showed that as the zipf s factor @xmath3 increases and the relative popularity of the content gets skewed , the access icn just caches the more popular content and the content provider serves only requests for less popular content while the transit icn just forwards the demands to the content provider without locally caching any content itself .
the insights obtained from the analysis here warrants further investigation into the case of asymmetric access icns . in this paper , we discussed a hierarchical scenario with @xmath38 access icns , one transit icn and one content provider . in the special case that the transit icns are not `` interconnected to each other , the model in this paper is readily extendable for multiple transit icns
however , a generalized scenario with either multiple ' ' interconnected ' transit icns or multiple content providers is a direction for future work .
two sequences @xmath142 and @xmath143 defined in proposition [ p2 ] are concave sequences .              @xmath153\sum\limits_{i = th + 1}^{m + 1 } { { q_m}(i ) }   + th{c_{{c_0}}}\\   \rightarrow f\left ( { th } \right ) = \left [ { { c_0}{{\left ( { th + 1 } \right)}^\gamma } } \right]\sum\limits_{i = th + 1}^{m + 1 } { { { \left ( { \frac{1}{i } } \right)}^{^\gamma } } }   + th{c_{{c_0 } } } \end{array}$ ]        if this inequality holds for all @xmath4 and @xmath150 , then sequence @xmath152 is concave .
we introduce @xmath155 $ ] .
two functions @xmath156 and @xmath157 are zero for all @xmath82 that satisfy the above inequality .
it means that for @xmath158 and @xmath159 , @xmath152 is a concave sequence .
moreover , @xmath160 can be written as    @xmath161 - \left [ { { { \left ( { th + 1 } \right)}^\gamma } + t{h^\gamma } } \right]\\   \rightarrow { \varphi _ \gamma } \left ( { th } \right ) = { \left ( { \frac{{th}}{{th + 1 } } } \right)^\gamma } + { \left ( { \frac{{th + 2}}{{th + 1 } } } \right)^\gamma } - 2 .
\end{array}$ ]    since @xmath162 for @xmath163 , @xmath160 is negative for all @xmath150 and @xmath4 which cause that above inequality be satisfied .
therefore , @xmath152 is a concave sequence for all @xmath4 and all @xmath7 .
we already showed that the first term of sequence @xmath166 is concave , so we just need to show that the second term @xmath175 is also concave .
then , we have to show that the following inequality holds for every @xmath164              r.g.xylomenos , c. n.ververidis , v.a.siris , n.fotiou , c.tsilopoulos , x.vasilakos , k.v.katsaros , and g.c .
